                    <h1>Medicago pubescens</h1>
<p>Medicago pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it often grows in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Medicago pubescens is also valued as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in soil enrichment.</p>
