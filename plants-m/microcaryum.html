                    <h1>Microcaryum</h1>
<p>Microcaryum, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Microcaryum species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which contributes to their restricted distribution.</p>
<p>Their ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of their native habitats.</p>
