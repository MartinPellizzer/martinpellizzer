                    <h1>Medicago rigidula f. subnudulosa</h1>
<p>Medicago rigidula f. subnudulosa, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other forms of Medicago rigidula.</p>
