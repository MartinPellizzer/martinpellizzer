<p>Muhlenbergia elata, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a native grass species found throughout much of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and tall, slender stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
<p>Muhlenbergia elata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
