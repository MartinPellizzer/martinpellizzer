                    <h1>Microlepia firma var. hirta</h1>
<p>Microlepia firma var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Microlepia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris and related genera.</p>
