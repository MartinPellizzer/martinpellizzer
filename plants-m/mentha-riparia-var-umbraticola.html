                    <h1>Mentha riparia var. umbraticola</h1>
<p>Mentha riparia var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in riparian zones, along stream banks, and in woodland areas where there is consistent moisture. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often darker in color due to its shaded habitat. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in whorls along the stem.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and its role in supporting local pollinators and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
