<p>Microlaena avenacea var. carsei, commonly known as the coastal microlaena, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, pale green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
