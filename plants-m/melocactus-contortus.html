                    <h1>Melocactus contortus</h1>
<p>Melocactus contortus, commonly known as the twisted melon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling spines and a ribbed, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in desert gardens.</p>
