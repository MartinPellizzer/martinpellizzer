<p>Microchilus miserus, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, short rhizome and a few narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters of 3 to 5, with a pale greenish-yellow coloration.</p>
<p>Microchilus miserus is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
