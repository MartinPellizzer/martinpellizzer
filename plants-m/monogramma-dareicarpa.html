<p>Monogramma dareicarpa, commonly known as the Chilean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Monogramma dareicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
