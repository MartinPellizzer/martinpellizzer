                    <h1>Mentha × verticillata f. calaminthoides</h1>
<p>Mentha × verticillata f. calaminthoides, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, distinguishing it from other mint species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence water quality and habitat structure.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
