                    <h1>Mimosa azuensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa azuensis, commonly known as the Azuensian sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Mimosa azuensis is often found in moist, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>
