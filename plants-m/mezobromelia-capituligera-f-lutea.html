                    <h1>Mezobromelia capituligera f. lutea</h1>
<p>Mezobromelia capituligera f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bromeliad, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and vibrant floral displays. The plant features striking yellow-orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
