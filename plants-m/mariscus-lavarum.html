                    <h1>Mariscus lavarum</h1>
<p>Mariscus lavarum, commonly known as the Lavarum marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silky down.</p>
<p>Mariscus lavarum thrives in damp, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
