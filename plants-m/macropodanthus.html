<p>Macropodanthus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert margins.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
