                    <h1>Mavia judicialis</h1>
<p>Mavia judicialis, commonly known as the judicial mavia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mavia judicialis is considered endangered and is protected in several South American countries.</p>
