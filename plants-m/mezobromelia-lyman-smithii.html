                    <h1>Mezobromelia lyman-smithii</h1>
<p>Mezobromelia lyman-smithii, commonly known as the Lyman-Smith's mezobromelia, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
