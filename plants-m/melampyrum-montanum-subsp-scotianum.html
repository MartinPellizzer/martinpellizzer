<p>Melampyrum montanum subsp.</p>
<p>scotianum, commonly known as the Scottish touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the Greek words for "yellow" and "to touch," likely referring to the way its flowers appear to beckon the touch of pollinators.</p>
