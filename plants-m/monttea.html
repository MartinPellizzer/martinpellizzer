                    <h1>Monttea</h1>
<p>Monttea, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal areas with saline or brackish water.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty environment. The plant's roots form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion. Monttea produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
