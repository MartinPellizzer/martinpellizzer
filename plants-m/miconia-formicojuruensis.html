                    <h1>Miconia formicojuruensis</h1>
<p>Miconia formicojuruensis, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its growth habit includes a woody stem with multiple branches, and it often forms colonies through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Miconia formicojuruensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting ant communities.</p>
