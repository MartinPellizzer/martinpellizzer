                    <h1>Mikania rufescens var. pachylepis</h1>
<p>Mikania rufescens var. pachylepis, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems.</p>
