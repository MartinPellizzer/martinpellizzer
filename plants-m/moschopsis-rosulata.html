<p>Moschopsis rosulata, commonly known as the rosette moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette growth form, with small, overlapping leaves that form a tight, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>Moschopsis rosulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
