                    <h1>Mimosa filipetiola</h1>
<p>Mimosa filipetiola, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and horticultural display.</p>
