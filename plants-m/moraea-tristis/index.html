                            <h1>Moraea Tristis</h1>
<p>Blue-eyed grass, scientifically known as Moraea tristis, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. This delicate yet resilient plant is characterized by its vivid blue petals and slender stems that rise elegantly from its basal leaves. Despite its common name, it is not a true grass but a flowering plant with a unique and elegant appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its beauty and adaptability make it a sought-after plant for both gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
