                    <h1>Malaxis rositae</h1>
<p>Malaxis rositae, commonly known as the Rosita's Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
