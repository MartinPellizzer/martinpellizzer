                    <h1>Mirabilis californica var. cedrosensis</h1>
<p>Mirabilis californica var. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the evening primrose family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California, specifically Cedros Island. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to the dry, coastal conditions of its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology.</p>
