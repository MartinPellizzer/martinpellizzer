<p>Mentha arvensis var. micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorls along the stem. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, primarily menthone and pulegone.</p>
