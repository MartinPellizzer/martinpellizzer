                    <h1>Mimosa flagelliformis</h1>
<p>Mimosa flagelliformis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a climbing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread across various surfaces.</p>
<p>Mimosa flagelliformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique reactive foliage.</p>
