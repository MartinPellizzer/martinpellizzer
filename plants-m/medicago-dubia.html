                    <h1>Medicago dubia</h1>
<p>Medicago dubia, commonly known as the rare desert medic, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone soils. It is adapted to high temperatures and low water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Medicago dubia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and forage production.</p>
