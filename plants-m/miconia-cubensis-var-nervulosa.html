<p>Miconia cubensis var. nervulosa, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often veined with a distinct network of light-colored veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by round, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas.</p>
