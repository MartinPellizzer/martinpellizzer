                    <h1>Myrtillocactus schenckii f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Myrtillocactus schenckii f. cristatus, commonly known as the crested myrtillocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, flattened, and often branched growth form. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem covered in small, spiny areoles, and it produces vibrant purple or blue flowers during the spring. Its crinkled, almost fern-like appearance is due to its naturally occurring cresting mutation, which makes it highly sought after by collectors.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
