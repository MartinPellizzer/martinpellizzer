                    <h1>Mimosa platycarpa var. platycarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa platycarpa var. platycarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
