<p>Micromeria benthamii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems, small ovate leaves, and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Micromeria benthamii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
