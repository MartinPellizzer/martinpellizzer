                    <h1>Mimosa invisa</h1>
<p>Mimosa invisa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
