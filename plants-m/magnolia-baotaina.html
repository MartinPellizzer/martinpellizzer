<p>Magnolia baotaina, commonly known as the Baotan magnolia, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often featuring a combination of white, pink, and red hues. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
