<p>Macrosiphonia verticillata, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its thalloid body is covered with small, scale-like structures called rhizoids, which help in anchoring and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
