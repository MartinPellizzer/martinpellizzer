                    <h1>Myriocephalus nudus var. oldfieldii</h1>
<p>Myriocephalus nudus var. oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, while some are floating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
