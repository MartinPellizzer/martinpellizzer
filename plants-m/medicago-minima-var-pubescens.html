                    <h1>Medicago minima var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Medicago minima var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent goatweed, is a small annual legume native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
