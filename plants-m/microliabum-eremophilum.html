                    <h1>Microliabum eremophilum</h1>
<p>Microliabum eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Microliabum eremophilum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
