                    <h1>Moquinia polymorpha var. sordida</h1>
<p>Moquinia polymorpha var. sordida, commonly known as the blackleaf moquinia, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often appear in dense clusters at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
