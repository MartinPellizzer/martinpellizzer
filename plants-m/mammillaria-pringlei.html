<p>Mammillaria pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
