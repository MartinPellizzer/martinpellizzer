<p>Marica pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
