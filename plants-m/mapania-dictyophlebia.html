                    <h1>Mapania dictyophlebia</h1>
<p>Mapania dictyophlebia, commonly known as the lace-veined fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a complex network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, round clusters along the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
