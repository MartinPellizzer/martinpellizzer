<p>Medicago arborea subsp.</p>
<p>strasseri, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and heart-shaped.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility.</p>
