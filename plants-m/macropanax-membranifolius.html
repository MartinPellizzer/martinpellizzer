                    <h1>Macropanax membranifolius</h1>
<p>Macropanax membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous-leaf macropanax, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the subtropical regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with delicate, membranous leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous forests, and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
