                    <h1>Medica villosa</h1>
<p>Medica villosa, commonly known as the hairy medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Medica villosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ecological benefits make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
