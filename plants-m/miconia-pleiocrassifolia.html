<p>Miconia pleiocrassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia pleiocrassifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets.</p>
