<p>Mespilodaphne indecora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mespilodaphne, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and deforestation.</p>
