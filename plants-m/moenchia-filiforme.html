<p>Moenchia filiforme, commonly known as slender water millet, is a small annual grass native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Moenchia filiforme is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
