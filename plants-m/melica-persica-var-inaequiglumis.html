<p>Melica persica var. inaequiglumis, commonly known as Persian vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct sheath. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unequal glumes, giving it its specific epithet "inaequiglumis.".</p>
