<p>Melaleuca diosmifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathland or open forest environments.</p>
<p>Melaleuca diosmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
