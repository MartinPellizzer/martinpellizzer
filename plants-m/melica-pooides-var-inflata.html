<p>Melica pooides var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in inflated, balloon-like structures that aid in dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
