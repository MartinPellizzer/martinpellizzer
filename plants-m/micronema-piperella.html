                    <h1>Micronema piperella</h1>
<p>Micronema piperella, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is a leafless, herbaceous plant that lacks chlorophyll, making it a unique photosynthetic species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and bogs.</p>
<p>Micronema piperella is often associated with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
