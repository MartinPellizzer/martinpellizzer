                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys var. latisquama</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghostplant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of chlorophyll, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to the understory biodiversity.</p>
