                    <h1>Melaleuca elachophylla</h1>
<p>Melaleuca elachophylla, commonly known as the silver bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and its unique bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
