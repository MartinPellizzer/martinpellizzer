<p>Mammillaria turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that give it a soft, puffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Mammillaria turbinata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for desert and semi-desert environments.</p>
