                    <h1>Mimosa amnis-atri</h1>
<p>Mimosa amnis-atri, commonly known as the black water mimosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Its name refers to the dark, almost black color of its seed pods, which develop after the flowers have faded.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Mimosa amnis-atri is considered an endangered species, making it a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
