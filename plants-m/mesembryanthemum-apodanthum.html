<p>Mesembryanthemum apodanthum, commonly known as the parasitic ice plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers. It thrives in arid environments and is often found growing on shrubs or trees.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
