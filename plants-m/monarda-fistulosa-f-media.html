                    <h1>Monarda fistulosa f. media</h1>
<p>Monarda fistulosa f. media, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bee balm, is a compact cultivar of the native American wild bergamot.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular red flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is more compact than the typical species, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant once established and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological value.</p>
