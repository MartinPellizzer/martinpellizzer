                    <h1>Moelleria</h1>
<p>Moelleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly appendages, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Moelleria species are epiphytic, meaning they derive moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Moelleria is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
