                    <h1>Microgramma nana</h1>
<p>Microgramma nana, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size and finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the leaves of the larger maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Microgramma nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
