<p>Morus alba var. chartacea, commonly known as the paper mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry tree native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thin and papery, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall. Its leaves are often used in traditional papermaking due to their fibrous structure.</p>
<p>The plant also produces small, pale yellow flowers and edible berries, though the latter are not typically consumed by humans.</p>
