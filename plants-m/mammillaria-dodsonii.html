                    <h1>Mammillaria dodsonii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus collectors.</p>
