<p>Mesembryanthemum intricatum, commonly known as the intricately branched ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
