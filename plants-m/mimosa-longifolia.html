                    <h1>Mimosa longifolia</h1>
<p>Mimosa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Mimosa longifolia is often found in sandy soils along the coastlines and in open woodlands.</p>
