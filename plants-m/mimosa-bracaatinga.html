<p>Mimosa bracaatinga, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa bracaatinga is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment.</p>
