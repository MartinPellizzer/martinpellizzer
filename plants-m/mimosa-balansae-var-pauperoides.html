<p>Mimosa balansae var. pauperoides, commonly known as the poor mimosa, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptive traits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation.</p>
