<p>Machaerina involuta, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique spiral arrangement of its fronds, which gives it a striking, otherworldly appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments.</p>
