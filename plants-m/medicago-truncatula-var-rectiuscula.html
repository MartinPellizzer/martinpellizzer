                    <h1>Medicago truncatula var. rectiuscula</h1>
<p>Medicago truncatula var. rectiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
