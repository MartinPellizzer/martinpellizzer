<p>Meconopsis punicea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Himalayan poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers and milky sap. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces large, cup-shaped flowers with white petals that contrast sharply with its purple or red stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires cool, moist conditions typical of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
