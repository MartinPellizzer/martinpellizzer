<p>Mimosa umbellifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Mimosa umbellifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
