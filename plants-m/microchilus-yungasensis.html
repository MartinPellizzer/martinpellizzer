<p>Microchilus yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas microchilus, is a flowering plant native to the humid montane forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
