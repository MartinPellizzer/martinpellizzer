                    <h1>Monechma arenicola</h1>
<p>Monechma arenicola, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal areas of the western United States.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and split open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Monechma arenicola is adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in dunes or disturbed soils.</p>
