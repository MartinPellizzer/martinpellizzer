                    <h1>Marginaria latebrosa</h1>
<p>Marginaria latebrosa, commonly known as the sandspit lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This lichen is typically found on exposed rocky substrates, where it can withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its growth form is crustose, meaning it adheres tightly to the surface it colonizes.</p>
<p>Marginaria latebrosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for microscopic organisms.</p>
