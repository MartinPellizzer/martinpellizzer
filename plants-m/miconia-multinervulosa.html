                    <h1>Miconia multinervulosa</h1>
<p>Miconia multinervulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian starapple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a common understory plant in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread.</p>
