<p>Melampyrum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>commutatum, commonly known as red bartsia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a lack of true roots, as it is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants for nutrients.</p>
