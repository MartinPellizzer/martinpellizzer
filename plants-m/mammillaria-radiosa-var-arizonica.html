                    <h1>Mammillaria radiosa var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Mammillaria radiosa var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with numerous small, rounded tubercles that bear white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its dense, woolly covering helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
