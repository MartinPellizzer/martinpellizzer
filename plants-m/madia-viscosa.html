<p>Madia viscosa, commonly known as sticky madia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The resinous properties of Madia viscosa have historically been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
