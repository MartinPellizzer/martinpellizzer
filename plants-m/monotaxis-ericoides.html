<p>Monotaxis ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or mauve in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and periods of drought.</p>
<p>Monotaxis ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
