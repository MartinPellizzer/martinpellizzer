<p>Marina ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's sea lavender, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along the dunes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
