<p>Microlepia exserta, commonly known as the narrowleaf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Microlepia exserta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
