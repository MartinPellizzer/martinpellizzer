<p>Marsilea macra, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie submerged. The plant has a delicate, branched rhizome system that helps it anchor in mud or soft sediment. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Marsilea macra is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
