                    <h1>Macaranga bracteata</h1>
<p>Macaranga bracteata, commonly known as the velvet leaf or mountain maple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession.</p>
