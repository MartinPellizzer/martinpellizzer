                    <h1>Mystacidium ochraceum</h1>
<p>Mystacidium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together form a composite organism. It is often found growing on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct coloration and growth habit, it is relatively easy to identify in the field.</p>
