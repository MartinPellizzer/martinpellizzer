<p>Mimosa rubicaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, red-tinged stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or movement. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Mimosa rubicaulis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
