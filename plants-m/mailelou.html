                    <h1>Mailelou</h1>
<p>Mailelou, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Mailelou plays a role in the ecological balance of Hawaiian forests, though its parasitic nature can weaken its host.</p>
<p>It is also culturally significant to Native Hawaiians.</p>
