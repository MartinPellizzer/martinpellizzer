<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
