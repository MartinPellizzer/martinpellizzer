                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum serotinum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal.</p>
