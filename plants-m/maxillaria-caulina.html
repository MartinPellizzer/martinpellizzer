                    <h1>Maxillaria caulina</h1>
<p>Maxillaria caulina, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a distinctive lip that is marked with purple or brown patterns. Maxillaria caulina is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and specialized orchid collections.</p>
