                    <h1>Micropus brevissimus</h1>
<p>Micropus brevissimus, commonly known as the short-stemmed burrweed, is a small, annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Micropus brevissimus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
