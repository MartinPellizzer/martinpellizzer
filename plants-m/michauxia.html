<p>Michauxia, commonly known as the silverleaf or mountain silver, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves that often have a silvery or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Michauxia species are typically found in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. They produce small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
