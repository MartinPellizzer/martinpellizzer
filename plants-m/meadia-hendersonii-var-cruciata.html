The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it forms compact, low-growing rosettes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
