                    <h1>Medicago nigra var. tricycla</h1>
<p>Medicago nigra var. tricycla, commonly known as black medic, is a perennial forage legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a slight pubescence, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods containing several small, dark seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Black medic is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and nutrient-fixing capabilities make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration and soil enrichment.</p>
