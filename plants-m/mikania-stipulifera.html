<p>Mikania stipulifera, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous, herbaceous vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forests.</p>
