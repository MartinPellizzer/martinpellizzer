<p>Mertensia maritima subsp.</p>
<p>asiatica, commonly known as the Asian sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the European Mertensia maritima but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological adaptations to its Asian habitat.</p>
