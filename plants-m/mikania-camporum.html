<p>Mikania camporum, commonly known as the climbing hemp vine, is a fast-growing perennial vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can climb and entangle other plants, forming dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Mikania camporum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
