<p>Mabea brasiliensis var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant bears red, fleshy berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if ingested in large quantities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
