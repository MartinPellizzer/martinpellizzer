                    <h1>Melampyrum chlorostachyum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum chlorostachyum, commonly known as the green-stem touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
