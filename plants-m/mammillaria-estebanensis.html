<p>Mammillaria estebanensis, commonly known as the Esteban's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant typically produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are often borne on short, lateral stems. Its growth is slow, and it forms a compact, rounded shape with prominent tubercles.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
