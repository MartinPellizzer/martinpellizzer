                    <h1>Miconia calocoma</h1>
<p>Miconia calocoma, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by distinctive, bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to form dense thickets, which can have ecological impacts in its native habitat.</p>
