<p>Mascagnia septentrionalis var. subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf mescal bean, is a variant of the mescal bean plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies and traditional medicine.</p>
