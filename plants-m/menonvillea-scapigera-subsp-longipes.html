<p>Menonvillea scapigera subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed menonvillea, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that display a range of colors from red to orange.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and challenging species for horticultural cultivation.</p>
