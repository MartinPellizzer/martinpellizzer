                    <h1>Morocarpus microcephalus</h1>
<p>Morocarpus microcephalus, commonly known as the miniature morocarpus, is a species of succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its leaves are typically short and cylindrical, arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Morocarpus microcephalus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
