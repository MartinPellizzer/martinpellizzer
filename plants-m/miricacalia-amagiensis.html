<p>Miricacalia amagiensis, commonly known as the Amami star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the islands of Amami ÅŒshima and Tokunoshima in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within primary forests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its blooming period occurs during late spring to early summer, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
