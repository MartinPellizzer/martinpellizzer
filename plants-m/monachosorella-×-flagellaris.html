<p>Monachosorella × flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture effectively. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Monachosorella × flagellaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
