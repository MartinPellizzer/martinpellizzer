<p>Mammillaria radiosa f. deserti, commonly known as the Desert Mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a spherical or oblate stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are adorned with short, white radial spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its grayish-green body. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
