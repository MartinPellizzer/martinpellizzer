<p>Minuartia escalerae, commonly known as the Escalera's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Minuartia escalerae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
