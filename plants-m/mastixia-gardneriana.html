                    <h1>Mastixia gardneriana</h1>
<p>Mastixia gardneriana, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It relies on host trees such as rimu and pohutukawa for water and nutrients while producing its own chlorophyll for some photosynthesis. The plant has small, glossy leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
