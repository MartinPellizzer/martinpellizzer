                    <h1>Malaxis saprophyta</h1>
<p>Malaxis saprophyta, commonly known as the corpse orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers emit a faint, musty odor, which is thought to mimic the scent of decaying organic matter to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis saprophyta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
