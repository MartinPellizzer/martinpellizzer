                    <h1>Mimosa chaetocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa chaetocarpa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and its ability to close its leaves in response to touch, a phenomenon called thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique behavior, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
