<p>Microstylis arachnifera, commonly known as the spider-hair grass, is a small, delicate perennial grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tiny, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems.</p>
