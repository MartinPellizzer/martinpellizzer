<p>Myrcia schottiana var. sericea, commonly known as silver myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a silvery-white underside due to the presence of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, orange-red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
