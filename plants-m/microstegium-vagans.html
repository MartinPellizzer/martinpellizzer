                    <h1>Microstegium vagans</h1>
<p>Microstegium vagans, commonly known as the wandering grass or small-step grass, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Microstegium vagans is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an important component of early successional plant communities.</p>
