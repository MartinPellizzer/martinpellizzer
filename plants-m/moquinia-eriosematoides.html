                    <h1>Moquinia eriosematoides</h1>
<p>Moquinia eriosematoides, commonly known as the woolly moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Moquinia eriosematoides plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
