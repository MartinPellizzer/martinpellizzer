                    <h1>Marsilea natans</h1>
<p>Marsilea natans, commonly known as water clover, is a free-floating aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover leaves, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Marsilea natans reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
