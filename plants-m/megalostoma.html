                    <h1>Megalostoma</h1>
<p>Megalostoma, commonly known as the giant mouth orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that often feature a distinctive, mouth-like appearance. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The flowers of Megalostoma species are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly flies and bees, due to their strong scent and nectar-rich structures.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological role in their native habitats.</p>
