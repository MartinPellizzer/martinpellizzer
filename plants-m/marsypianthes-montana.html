                    <h1>Marsypianthes montana</h1>
<p>Marsypianthes montana, commonly known as the mountain marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, it is a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
