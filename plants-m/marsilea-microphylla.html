                    <h1>Marsilea microphylla</h1>
<p>Marsilea microphylla, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are often used as a decorative element in water gardens. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to parts of Asia and is commonly found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
