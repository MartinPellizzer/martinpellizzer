                    <h1>Marcgravia flagellaris</h1>
<p>Marcgravia flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on trees in the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marcgraviaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Marcgravia flagellaris is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests.</p>
