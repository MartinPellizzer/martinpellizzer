<p>Mesadenia dentata, commonly known as the serrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or greenish-white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
