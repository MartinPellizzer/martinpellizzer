<p>Mammillaria dioica f. verhaertiana, commonly known as the Verhaert's mammillaria, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid environments. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female, which influences its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
