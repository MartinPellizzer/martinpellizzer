<p>Mimosa gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions.</p>
