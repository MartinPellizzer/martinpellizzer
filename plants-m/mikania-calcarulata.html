                    <h1>Mikania calcarulata</h1>
<p>Mikania calcarulata, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
