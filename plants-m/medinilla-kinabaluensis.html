                    <h1>Medinilla kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Medinilla kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu medinilla, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, fleshy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in the dense rainforest canopy. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
