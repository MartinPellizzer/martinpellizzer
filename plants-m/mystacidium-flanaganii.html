<p>Mystacidium flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are semi-evergreen, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Mystacidium flanaganii is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions.</p>
