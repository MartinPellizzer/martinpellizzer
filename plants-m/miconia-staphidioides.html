                    <h1>Miconia staphidioides</h1>
<p>Miconia staphidioides, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky, red berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are considered toxic to humans and domesticated livestock.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, Miconia staphidioides is often classified as a noxious weed in regions where it has been introduced.</p>
