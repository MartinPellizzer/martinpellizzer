                    <h1>Macrobia tortuosa</h1>
<p>Macrobia tortuosa, commonly known as the winding macrobia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped growth pattern.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features elongated, waxy leaves that curl tightly around its stem, creating a compact, spiral form. Its flowers are small, pale green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Macrobia tortuosa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
