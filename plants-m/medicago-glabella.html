                    <h1>Medicago glabella</h1>
<p>Medicago glabella, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Medicago glabella is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment.</p>
