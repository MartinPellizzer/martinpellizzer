                    <h1>Miconia coronata</h1>
<p>Miconia coronata, commonly known as the crownleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often with a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia coronata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is significant due to its ability to outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
