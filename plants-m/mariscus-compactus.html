                    <h1>Mariscus compactus</h1>
<p>Mariscus compactus, commonly known as the compact muskgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soil conditions, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mariscus compactus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
