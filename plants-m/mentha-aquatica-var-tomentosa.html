<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong mint aroma when crushed. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other water-saturated habitats.</p>
