                    <h1>Muscari racemosum var. pulchellum</h1>
<p>Muscari racemosum var. pulchellum, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, resembling small grapes, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces underground bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate, clustered flowers.</p>
