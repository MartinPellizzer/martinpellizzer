                    <h1>Metternichia princeps</h1>
<p>Metternichia princeps, commonly known as the royal lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish petals that resemble those of a lily. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metternichia princeps is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
