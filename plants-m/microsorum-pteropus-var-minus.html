<p>Microsorum pteropus var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf java fern, is a hardy aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that grow along the stems, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant is characterized by its rhizome, which anchors it to substrates in aquariums or ponds. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is popular among aquascapers for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for maintaining a balanced and natural-looking aquatic environment.</p>
