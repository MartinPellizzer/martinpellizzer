                    <h1>Medicago minima f. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Medicago minima f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with glandular structures on the leaflets, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
