<p>[WRONG START] Macleodium canum, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically broad, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
