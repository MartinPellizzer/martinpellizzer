                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum arboriforme</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum arboriforme, commonly known as the tree-like ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched, tree-like structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and succulent, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum arboriforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
