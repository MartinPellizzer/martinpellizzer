                    <h1>Mimosa tovarensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovar mimosa, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa tovarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
