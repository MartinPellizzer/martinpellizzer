<p>Mimosa scaberrima, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa scaberrima is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in certain ecosystems.</p>
