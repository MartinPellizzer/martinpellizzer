<p>Mollugo flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>flavescens, commonly known as yellow sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May.</p>
<p>The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields.</p>
