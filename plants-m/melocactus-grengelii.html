<p>Melocactus grengelii, commonly known as the green melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is typically green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits resembling melons. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
