<p>Miconia mellina, commonly known as the sweetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
