                    <h1>Malus sieversii f. spherocarpa</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii f. spherocarpa, commonly known as the spherical crabapple, is a rare and unique variant of the crabapple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and smaller, often more ornamental fruits compared to typical crabapples. This form is native to Central Asia and is considered a genetic ancestor of many cultivated apple varieties. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, red or yellow fruits in autumn.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in the genetic diversity of the genus Malus.</p>
