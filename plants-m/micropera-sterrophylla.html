                    <h1>Micropera sterrophylla</h1>
<p>Micropera sterrophylla, commonly known as the small-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Micropera sterrophylla is often found in coastal dunes and inland salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
