<p>Microlaena carsei, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in dunes and heathlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Microlaena carsei plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
