                    <h1>Myrtus communis var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Myrtus communis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Myrtus communis. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in hedges and ornamental landscaping due to its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage.</p>
