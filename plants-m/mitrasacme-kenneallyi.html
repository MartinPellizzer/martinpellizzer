<p>Mitrasacme kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kenneally's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing some level of protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
