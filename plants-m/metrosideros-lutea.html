                    <h1>Metrosideros lutea</h1>
<p>Metrosideros lutea, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on a host tree for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract insect pollinators. It produces small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
