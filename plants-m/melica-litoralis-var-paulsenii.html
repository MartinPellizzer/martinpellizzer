<p>Melica litoralis var. paulsenii, commonly known as the coastal melica, is a grass species native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other melica species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits.</p>
