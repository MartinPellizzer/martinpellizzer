<p>Mammillaria multicentralis, commonly known as the multispine mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant typically has a short, thick stem with numerous areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale orange, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Mammillaria multicentralis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its spiny covering.</p>
