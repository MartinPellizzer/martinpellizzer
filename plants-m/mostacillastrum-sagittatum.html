<p>Mostacillastrum sagittatum, commonly known as arrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
