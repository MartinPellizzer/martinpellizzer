                    <h1>Mapania zinnirahae</h1>
<p>Mapania zinnirahae, commonly known as the Zinnirahae maple, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that attract various bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
