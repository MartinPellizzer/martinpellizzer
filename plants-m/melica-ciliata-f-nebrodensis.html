                    <h1>Melica ciliata f. nebrodensis</h1>
<p>Melica ciliata f. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden alpine grass, is a rare subspecies of the slender meadowgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species.</p>
