<p>Mammillaria humilior, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with closely spaced, pale green ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique form, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
