                    <h1>Mascagnia schunkei</h1>
<p>Mascagnia schunkei, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils with minimal water availability.</p>
