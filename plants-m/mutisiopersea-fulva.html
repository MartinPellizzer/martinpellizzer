                    <h1>Mutisiopersea fulva</h1>
<p>Mutisiopersea fulva, commonly known as the golden mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of round, yellow-orange fruits with a thick, sweet pulp. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and the edible, nutritious fruit it produces.</p>
