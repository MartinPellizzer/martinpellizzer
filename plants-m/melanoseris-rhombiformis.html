<p>Melanoseris rhombiformis, commonly known as the diamond-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flattened and closely spaced. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture directly from the environment. Its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves give it its common name, and it often forms dense mats that contribute to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Melanoseris rhombiformis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
