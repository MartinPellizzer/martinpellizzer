<p>Memora, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a unique and rare plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its evocative common name. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in high humidity and filtered sunlight. Memora flowers are typically small and emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
