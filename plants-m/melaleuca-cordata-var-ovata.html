                    <h1>Melaleuca cordata var. ovata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca cordata var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in winter and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rainforests.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other melaleuca species and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
