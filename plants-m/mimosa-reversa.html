<p>Mimosa reversa, commonly known as the reverse mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or movement. Mimosa reversa is known for its rapid leaf movement, a trait called thigmonastic response, which helps it conserve water.</p>
