                    <h1>Miconia bracteata</h1>
<p>Miconia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
