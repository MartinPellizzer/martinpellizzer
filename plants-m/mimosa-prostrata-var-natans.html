                    <h1>Mimosa prostrata var. natans</h1>
<p>Mimosa prostrata var. natans, commonly known as floating mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fern-like leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
