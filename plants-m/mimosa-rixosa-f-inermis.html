<p>Mimosa rixosa f. inermis, commonly known as the soft mimosa, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, sandy soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of thorns, setting it apart from other mimosa species.</p>
