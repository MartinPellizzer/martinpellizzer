                    <h1>Macropanax simplicifolius</h1>
<p>Macropanax simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaf macropanax, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark purple berries containing oval seeds. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Macropanax simplicifolius is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
