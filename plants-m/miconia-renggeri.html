                    <h1>Miconia renggeri</h1>
<p>Miconia renggeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by large, woody, spiny fruits. Miconia renggeri is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in non-native habitats.</p>
