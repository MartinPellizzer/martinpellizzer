                    <h1>Miconia castrensis</h1>
<p>Miconia castrensis, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Miconia castrensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
