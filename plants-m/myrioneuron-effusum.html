<p>Myrioneuron effusum, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with slender, grass-like leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
