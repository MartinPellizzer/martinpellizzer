<p>Myristica mindorensis, commonly known as Mindanao nutmeg, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the valuable spice known as mace. The plant produces small, white flowers and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds, which are enclosed in a red, fleshy aril, are the source of the spice, while the dried seed coverings are used as mace.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
