                    <h1>Myrmecodia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia angustifolia, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, hollow stem that serves as a habitat for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of white or yellow flowers. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, compact colonies.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Myrmecodia angustifolia make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study.</p>
