<p>Maianthemum lichiangense, commonly known as the Lichiang false lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
