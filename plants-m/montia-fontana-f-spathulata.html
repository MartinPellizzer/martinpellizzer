<p>Montia fontana f. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, often alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped or spatulate leaves that are typically succulent and slightly hairy, adapted to retain water in its habitat. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress varieties.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in specialty salads.</p>
