                    <h1>Melaleuca leucadendra var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca leucadendra var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, revealing a pale, fibrous underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
