<p>Monotropa uniflora var. typica, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi to obtain nutrients from its host trees. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale green. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing in association with hemlock or fir trees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and delicate appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
