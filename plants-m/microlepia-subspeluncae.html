                    <h1>Microlepia subspeluncae</h1>
<p>Microlepia subspeluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to limestone caves in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for some of its nutritional needs. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are adapted to low-light conditions. It is classified as an epiphytic species, growing on rock surfaces rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
