                <h1>Margyricarpus setosus</h1>
<p>Margyricarpus setosus, commonly known as the hairy seed plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive seed morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, though it is not closely related to any known living species. The plant is notable for its setose (hairy) seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is primarily found in the fossil record, indicating it was a part of ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and lack of living specimens, much of its botanical detail remains speculative.</p>
