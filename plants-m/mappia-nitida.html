                    <h1>Mappia nitida</h1>
<p>Mappia nitida, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and distinctive, doubly serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Mappia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes.</p>
