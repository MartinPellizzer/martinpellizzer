<p>Morus scandens, commonly known as the climbing mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called mulberries, which are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Morus scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
