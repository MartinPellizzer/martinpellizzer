<p>Mammillaria fordii, commonly known as the Ford's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, thick stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mammillaria fordii is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering.</p>
