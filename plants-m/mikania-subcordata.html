                    <h1>Mikania subcordata</h1>
<p>Mikania subcordata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its aggressive spreading nature.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
