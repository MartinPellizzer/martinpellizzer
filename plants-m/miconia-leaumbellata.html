                    <h1>Miconia leaumbellata</h1>
<p>Miconia leaumbellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions.</p>
