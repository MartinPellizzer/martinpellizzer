<p>Masdevallia jimeneziana, commonly known as the Jimenez's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spurred flowers that typically display a mix of purple, white, and green hues. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
