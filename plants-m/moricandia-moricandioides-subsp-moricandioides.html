<p>Moricandia moricandioides subsp.</p>
<p>moricandioides, commonly known as the desert cabbages, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and adapted to access groundwater, allowing it to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
