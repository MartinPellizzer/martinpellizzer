<p>Moquinia polymorpha var. populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often form dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
