<p>Mystacidium productum, commonly known as the clustered sea lettuce, is a marine green alga belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thalli that grow in dense clusters on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with each branch splitting into two equal parts. It contains chlorophyll a and b, enabling it to perform photosynthesis efficiently in marine environments.</p>
