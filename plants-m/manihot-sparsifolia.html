                    <h1>Manihot sparsifolia</h1>
<p>Manihot sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright stem and alternate, ovate leaves with sparse venation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the spurge family.</p>
<p>Its roots are edible and have been used traditionally for their starchy content, though the plant itself is not as commercially significant as other Manihot species.</p>
