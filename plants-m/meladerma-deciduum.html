                    <h1>Meladerma deciduum</h1>
<p>Meladerma deciduum, commonly known as the brittleleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deciduous leaves that turn brown and fall off during dry seasons, allowing the plant to conserve water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Meladerma deciduum is an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic flora.</p>
