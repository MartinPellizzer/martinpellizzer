<p>Mollugo floriana, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms.

Its simple, opposite leaves are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers.</p>
<p>Mollugo floriana is a member of the family Molluginaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands.</p>
