<p>Melocactus bellavistensis subsp.</p>
<p>bellavistensis, commonly known as the Bellavista melocactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
