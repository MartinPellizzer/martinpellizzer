                    <h1>Mimosa adianthifolia</h1>
<p>Mimosa adianthifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its rapid leaf movement is due to the presence of specialized cells called pulvini at the base of each leaflet.</p>
<p>Mimosa adianthifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
