<p>Moranopteris steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Moranopteris steyermarkii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
