<p>Mesosphaerum stellulatum, commonly known as the star-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in star-like formations, giving it its common name. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its fruit is typically a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum stellulatum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
