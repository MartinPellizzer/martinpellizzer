                    <h1>Malaxis japonica</h1>
<p>Malaxis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Japan and parts of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its root system while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Malaxis japonica is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
