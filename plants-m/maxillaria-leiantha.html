<p>Maxillaria leiantha, commonly known as the silver ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, velvety texture. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range.</p>
