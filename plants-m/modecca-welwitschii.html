                    <h1>Modecca welwitschii</h1>
<p>Modecca welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii tree, is a unique species native to Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest known plant species, with some individuals estimated to be over 2,000 years old. The tree has a distinctive appearance, featuring a thick, gnarled trunk and sparse, waxy leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It is adapted to extreme drought, storing water in its trunk and having a deep root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its resilience and its role in the ecosystems of the Namib Desert.</p>
