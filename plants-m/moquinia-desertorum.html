                    <h1>Moquinia desertorum</h1>
<p>Moquinia desertorum, commonly known as the desert moquinea, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Moquinia desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
