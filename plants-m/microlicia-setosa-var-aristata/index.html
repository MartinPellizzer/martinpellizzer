                            <h1>Microlicia Setosa Var. Aristata</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Microlicia setosa var. aristata, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. Its most distinctive feature is its velvety, dark green leaves that give it its common name. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its lush foliage and elegant appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to flourish. Despite its beauty, Velvetleaf can become invasive in certain regions, making it both a desirable and challenging plant to grow.</p>
