<p>Mahonia caelicolor, commonly known as the alpine mahonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>Mahonia caelicolor is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
