                    <h1>Medicago muricata</h1>
<p>Medicago muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Medicago muricata is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
