                    <h1>Misanteca salicifolia</h1>
<p>Misanteca salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, willow-like leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement, and its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a sweet scent. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Misanteca salicifolia plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
