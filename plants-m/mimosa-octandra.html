                    <h1>Mimosa octandra</h1>
<p>Mimosa octandra, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa octandra is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
