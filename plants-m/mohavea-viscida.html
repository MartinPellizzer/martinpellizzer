<p>Mohavea viscida, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woolly, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mohavea viscida plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
