                    <h1>Mimosa polycephala</h1>
<p>Mimosa polycephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Mimosa polycephala is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
