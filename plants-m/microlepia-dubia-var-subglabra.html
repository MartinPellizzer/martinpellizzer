<p>Microlepia dubia var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The leaves are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that have a smooth, glabrous underside. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
