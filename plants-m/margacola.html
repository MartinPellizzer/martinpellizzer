                    <h1>Margacola</h1>
<p>Margacola, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a hardy plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Margacola is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes.</p>
