                    <h1>Mandragora vernalis</h1>
<p>Mandragora vernalis, commonly known as spring mandrake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it both a botanical curiosity and a plant with significant historical and medicinal importance.</p>
<p>Its roots, which are thick and often branched, have been traditionally used in folk medicine, though they are highly poisonous and should never be consumed without expert guidance.</p>
