                    <h1>Mondo gracile var. brevipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Mondo gracile var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the dwarf mondo grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and ability to form a dense ground cover.</p>
