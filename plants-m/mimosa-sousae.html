                    <h1>Mimosa sousae</h1>
<p>Mimosa sousae, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions with deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mimosa sousae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
