<p>Mammillaria tolimensis var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined tolimensis cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in short, white spines and dense, woolly areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the stem apex. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
