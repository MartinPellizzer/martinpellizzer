<p>Masdevallia restrepioidea, commonly known as the Restrepo's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structure and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small but highly ornate, with intricate patterns and a variety of hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
