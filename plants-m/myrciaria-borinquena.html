                    <h1>Myrciaria borinquena</h1>
<p>Myrciaria borinquena, commonly known as the Puerto Rican guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that give way to small, pinkish-red fruits resembling guavas but with a unique, tart flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
