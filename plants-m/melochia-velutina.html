<p>Melochia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release small, round seeds.</p>
<p>Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
