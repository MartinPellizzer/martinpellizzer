                    <h1>Mystacidium exile</h1>
<p>Mystacidium exile, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the branches of specific host trees, such as oaks and elms.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, which can weaken the host over time.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Mystacidium exile plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
