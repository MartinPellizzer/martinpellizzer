<p>Melocactus harlowii subsp.</p>
<p>evae, commonly known as the Eave's melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with prominent, elongated spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
