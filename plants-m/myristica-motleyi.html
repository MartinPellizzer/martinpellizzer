<p>Myristica motleyi, commonly known as the Motley's nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, aromatic fruits.</p>
<p>The seeds inside the fruit are the primary part used, though the plant's botanical features include a distinctive, woody structure and a complex root system adapted to its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
