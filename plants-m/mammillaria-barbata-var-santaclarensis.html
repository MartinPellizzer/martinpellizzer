<p>Mammillaria barbata var. santaclarensis, commonly known as the Santa Clara hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular shape with short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
