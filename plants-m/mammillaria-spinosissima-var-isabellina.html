                    <h1>Mammillaria spinosissima var. isabellina</h1>
<p>Mammillaria spinosissima var. isabellina, commonly known as the Isabellina mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular to cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'isabellina' refers to its pale, almost ivory-colored appearance.</p>
