                    <h1>Monotropa morisoniana</h1>
<p>Monotropa morisoniana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from host trees.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
