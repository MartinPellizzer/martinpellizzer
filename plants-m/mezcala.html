                    <h1>Mezcala</h1>
<p>Mezcala, commonly known as the sacred mushroom, is a psychoactive fungus native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Psilocybe* and contains the hallucinogenic compounds psilocybin and psilocin. The plant is typically found growing in humid, shaded environments, often near decaying organic matter. Its spore-filled caps are used in traditional spiritual ceremonies by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, mezcala is classified as a controlled substance in many countries.</p>
