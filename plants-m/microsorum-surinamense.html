<p>Microsorum surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded areas with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its unique ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
