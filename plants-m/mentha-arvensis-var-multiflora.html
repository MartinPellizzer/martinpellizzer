                    <h1>Mentha arvensis var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Mentha arvensis var. multiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slightly hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other mints and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and cooling properties.</p>
