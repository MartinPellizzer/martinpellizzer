                    <h1>Melaleuca tamariscina</h1>
<p>Melaleuca tamariscina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves. It produces small white or pale pink flowers in dense spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Melaleuca tamariscina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
