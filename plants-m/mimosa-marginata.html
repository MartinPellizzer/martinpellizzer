                    <h1>Mimosa marginata</h1>
<p>Mimosa marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Mimosa marginata is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name.</p>
