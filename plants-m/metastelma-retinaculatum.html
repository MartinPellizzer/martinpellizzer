<p>Metastelma retinaculatum, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Metastelma retinaculatum is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
