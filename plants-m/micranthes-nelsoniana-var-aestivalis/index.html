                            <h1>Micranthes Nelsoniana Var. Aestivalis</h1>
<p>Blue-eyed mary, scientifically known as Micranthes nelsoniana var. aestivalis, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the rocky slopes of the western United States. With its vivid blue petals and prominent yellow centers, it resembles a miniature version of the traditional blue-eyed Mary flower. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its delicate appearance belies its hardiness, as it is capable of surviving in harsh, arid environments. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in the world of horticulture, often overlooked in favor of more common garden flowers.</p>
