<p>Marsilea minuta var. minuta, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that often appear in whorls, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species for water quality and a potential weed in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
