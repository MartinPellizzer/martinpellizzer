<p>Mesembryanthemum subulatum, commonly known as the ice plant or frost plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its fleshy stems allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
