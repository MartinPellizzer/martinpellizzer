<p>Medicago hispida subsp.</p>
<p>oligocarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions as a forage crop and for soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>The plant's seeds are typically dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
