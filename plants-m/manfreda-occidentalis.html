                    <h1>Manfreda occidentalis</h1>
<p>Manfreda occidentalis, commonly known as the Western manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is a perennial species that often forms dense clumps, and its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
