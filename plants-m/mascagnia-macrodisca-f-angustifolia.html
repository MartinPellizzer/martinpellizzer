                    <h1>Mascagnia macrodisca f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Mascagnia macrodisca f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert nightshade, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible but has a mildly toxic taste.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
