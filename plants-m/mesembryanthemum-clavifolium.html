<p>Mesembryanthemum clavifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
