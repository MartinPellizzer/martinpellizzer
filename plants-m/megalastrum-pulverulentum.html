                <h1>Megalastrum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Megalastrum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty megalastrum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically appearing as small, yellowish clusters during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
