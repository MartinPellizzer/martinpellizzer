<p>Medicago italica subsp.</p>
<p>striata, commonly known as the striated medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along the central leaflet, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance also make it a suitable candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
