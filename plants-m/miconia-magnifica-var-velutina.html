                    <h1>Miconia magnifica var. velutina</h1>
<p>Miconia magnifica var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers.</p>
