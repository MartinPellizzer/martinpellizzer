                    <h1>Minuartia gracilipes</h1>
<p>Minuartia gracilipes, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Minuartia gracilipes is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
