<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, Malaxis wappeana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
