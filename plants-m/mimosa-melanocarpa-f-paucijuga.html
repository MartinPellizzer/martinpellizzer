                    <h1>Mimosa melanocarpa f. paucijuga</h1>
<p>Mimosa melanocarpa f. paucijuga, commonly known as the sparse-leaf black mimosa, is a variant of the black mimosa, characterized by its reduced leaflets and darker, more robust foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response.</p>
<p>This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
