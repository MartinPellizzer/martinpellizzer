                    <h1>Mentha litoralis var. interrupta</h1>
<p>Mentha litoralis var. interrupta, commonly known as the coastal mint or sea mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline, thriving in brackish or saline conditions. Its leaves are often smaller and more serrated compared to the typical water mint.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
