                    <h1>Moehringia villosa</h1>
<p>Moehringia villosa, commonly known as the hairy moehringia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Moehringia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
