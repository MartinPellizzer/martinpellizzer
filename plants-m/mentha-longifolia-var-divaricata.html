                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. divaricata</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping mint, is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing growth habit and aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a serrated edge, and emit a strong menthol scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common garden and wild plant in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species.</p>
