                    <h1>Marina unifoliolata</h1>
<p>Marina unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, single leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils makes it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Marina unifoliolata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
