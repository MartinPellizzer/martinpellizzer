                    <h1>Mimosa triphylla</h1>
<p>Mimosa triphylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil, making it a valuable plant in erosion control.</p>
<p>Mimosa triphylla is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions.</p>
