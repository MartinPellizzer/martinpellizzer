                    <h1>Microrphium</h1>
<p>Microrphium, commonly known as the floating heart, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. They typically have slender, branching stems that root in the substrate while the leaves remain afloat. Microrphium species are often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Their flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a single pistil and stamens that emerge from the water's surface.</p>
