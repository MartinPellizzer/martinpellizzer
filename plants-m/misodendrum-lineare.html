                    <h1>Misodendrum lineare</h1>
<p>Misodendrum lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
