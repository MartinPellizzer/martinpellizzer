<p>Marcgravia polyantha subsp.</p>
<p>polyantha, commonly known as the showy coca or the red coca, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features striking, velvety purple bracts that surround its small, white flowers, which are typically visited by hummingbirds.</p>
