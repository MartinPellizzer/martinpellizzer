<p>Magnistipula butayei subsp.</p>
<p>tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's magnistipula, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid microclimate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
