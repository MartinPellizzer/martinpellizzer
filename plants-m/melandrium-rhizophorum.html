                    <h1>Melandrium rhizophorum</h1>
<p>Melandrium rhizophorum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal dunes or open, disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Melandrium rhizophorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
