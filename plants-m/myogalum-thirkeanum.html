<p>Myogalum thirkeanum, commonly known as the golden thirkean, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
