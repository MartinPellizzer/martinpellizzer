                    <h1>Malus sieversii var. niedzwetzkyana</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii var. niedzwetzkyana, commonly known as the Niedzwetzkyana apple, is a rare and ancient species of apple native to the Tian Shan Mountains in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is considered a wild ancestor of many modern apple varieties and possesses a unique genetic makeup that contributes to its hardiness and adaptability. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, featuring simple, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit is generally small, tart, and not typically consumed fresh but is valued for its genetic diversity in breeding programs.</p>
<p>This variety plays a significant role in the study of apple evolution and conservation efforts.</p>
