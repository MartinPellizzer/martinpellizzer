                    <h1>Melpomene flabelliformis var. tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Melpomene flabelliformis var. tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui trumpet plant, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually elongated and glossy, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists alike.</p>
