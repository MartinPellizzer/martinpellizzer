<p>Mesembryanthemum angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
