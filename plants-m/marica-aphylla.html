                    <h1>Marica aphylla</h1>
<p>Marica aphylla, commonly known as the leafless marica, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves. Instead of leaves, it has modified stems that perform photosynthesis, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>Marica aphylla is adapted to extreme conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival.</p>
