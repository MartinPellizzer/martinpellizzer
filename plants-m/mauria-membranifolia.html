<p>Mauria membranifolia, commonly known as the parchment leaf plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that can cover large areas.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
