<p>Mesembryanthemum amplectens, commonly known as the cushion iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
