                    <h1>Myosotis collina var. senneniana</h1>
<p>Myosotis collina var. senneniana, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high elevation or rocky landscapes.</p>
