<p>Medinilla brevipedunculata, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plant for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Medinilla brevipedunculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
