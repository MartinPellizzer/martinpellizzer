<p>Mammillaria polyactina, commonly known as the clustered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>Mammillaria polyactina thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
