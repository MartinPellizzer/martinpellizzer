<p>Matisia lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's matisia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and have a broad, lobed structure. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small berries that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Matisia lozanoi is considered a rare and poorly studied species in botanical research.</p>
