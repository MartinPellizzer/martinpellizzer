                    <h1>Mammillaria bullardiana</h1>
<p>Mammillaria bullardiana, commonly known as the Bullard's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its grayish-green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
