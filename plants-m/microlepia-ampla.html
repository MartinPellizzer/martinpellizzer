<p>Microlepia ampla, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
