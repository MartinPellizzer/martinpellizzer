<p>Mammillaria crinita subsp.</p>
<p>wildii, commonly known as the Woolly Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it its common name and help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which emerge from areoles along its stem. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid gardens.</p>
