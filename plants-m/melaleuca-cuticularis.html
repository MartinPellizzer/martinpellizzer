                    <h1>Melaleuca cuticularis</h1>
<p>Melaleuca cuticularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale to reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
