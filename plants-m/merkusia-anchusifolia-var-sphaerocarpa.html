                    <h1>Merkusia anchusifolia var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Merkusia anchusifolia var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is distinguished by its rounded, fruiting bodies that resemble small spheres, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
