<p>Meyeria, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Meyeria is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
