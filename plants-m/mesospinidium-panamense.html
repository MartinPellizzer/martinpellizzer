<p>Mesospinidium panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian mesospinidium, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of tiny, spherical fruits. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
