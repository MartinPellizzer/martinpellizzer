<p>Mentha prostrata, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a strong, minty aroma. Mentha prostrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications.</p>
