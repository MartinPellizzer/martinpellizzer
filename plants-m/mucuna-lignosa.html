                    <h1>Mucuna lignosa</h1>
<p>Mucuna lignosa, commonly known as the woody cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. Mucuna lignosa is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil and making it a valuable plant in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it an important species for erosion control and forage production.</p>
