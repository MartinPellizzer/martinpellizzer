<p>Mimosa smithiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched.

Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty.</p>
<p>Mimosa smithiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and intriguing behavior.</p>
