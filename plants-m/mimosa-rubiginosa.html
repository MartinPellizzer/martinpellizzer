<p>Mimosa rubiginosa, commonly known as the stink bush or sticky mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa rubiginosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
