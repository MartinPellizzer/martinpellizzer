<p>Malaxis sutepensis, commonly known as the Sutep's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of western South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded, humid environments with rich organic soil. Its flowers are small and fragrant, adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
