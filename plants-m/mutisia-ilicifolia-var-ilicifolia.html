                    <h1>Mutisia ilicifolia var. ilicifolia</h1>
<p>Mutisia ilicifolia var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf mutisia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
