                    <h1>Millettia oosperma</h1>
<p>Millettia oosperma, commonly known as the golden pod tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow pods that contain small, edible seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
