                    <h1>Marginaria distans</h1>
<p>Marginaria distans, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in nutrient-rich, acidic conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Marginaria distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species.</p>
