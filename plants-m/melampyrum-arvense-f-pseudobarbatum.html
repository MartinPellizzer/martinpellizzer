<p>Melampyrum arvense f. pseudobarbatum, commonly known as the false goatweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a distinctive seed capsule that dehisces to release its seeds.</p>
