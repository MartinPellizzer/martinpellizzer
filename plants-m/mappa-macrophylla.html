<p>Mappa macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as beetles. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Mappa macrophylla plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
