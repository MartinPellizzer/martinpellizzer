                    <h1>Minuria scoparia</h1>
<p>Minuria scoparia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Minuria scoparia plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
