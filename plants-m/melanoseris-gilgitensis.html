<p>Melanoseris gilgitensis, commonly known as the Gilgit mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the leaves. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for studying high-altitude plant adaptations.</p>
