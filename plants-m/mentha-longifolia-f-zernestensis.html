<p>Mentha longifolia f. zernestensis, commonly known as Zernest's mint, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the mint family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
