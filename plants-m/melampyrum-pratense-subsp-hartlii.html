<p>Melampyrum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>hartlii, commonly known as Hart's yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
