                    <h1>Mystacidium globulosum</h1>
<p>Mystacidium globulosum, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, green thallus structures. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a thallus with specialized structures for absorption and reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Mystacidium globulosum reproduces via spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores.</p>
