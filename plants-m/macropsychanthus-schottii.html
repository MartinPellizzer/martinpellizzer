                    <h1>Macropsychanthus schottii</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus schottii, commonly known as the Schott's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly faces, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers that bloom in the early morning, often during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
