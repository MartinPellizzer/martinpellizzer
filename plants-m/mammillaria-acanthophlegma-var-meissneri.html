                    <h1>Mammillaria acanthophlegma var. meissneri</h1>
<p>Mammillaria acanthophlegma var. meissneri, commonly known as the Meissner's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant features short, cylindrical stems with areoles that bear clusters of stiff, white spines. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
