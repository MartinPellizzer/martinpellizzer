<p>Melocactus leucaster, commonly known as the white-spined melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is typically covered with white, waxy spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its thick, fleshy stem stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus leucaster is a slow-growing plant, often reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
