<p>Myosotis adpressa, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Myosotis adpressa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes.</p>
