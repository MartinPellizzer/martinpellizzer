<p>Melanophylla pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-stemmed nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming at night. Its leaves are broad and succulent, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Melanophylla pachypoda is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
