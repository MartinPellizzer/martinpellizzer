<p>Mesosphaerum eriocephalum, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum eriocephalum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
