<p>Medicago murex var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a hairy, sprawling habit and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
