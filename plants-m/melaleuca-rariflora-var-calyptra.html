<p>Melaleuca rariflora var. calyptra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, which release small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
