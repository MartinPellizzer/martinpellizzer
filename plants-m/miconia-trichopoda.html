                    <h1>Miconia trichopoda</h1>
<p>Miconia trichopoda, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropics.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia trichopoda is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
