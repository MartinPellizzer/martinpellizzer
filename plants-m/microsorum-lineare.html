                    <h1>Microsorum lineare</h1>
<p>Microsorum lineare, commonly known as the linear water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm in length, with a distinctive linear form. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
