                    <h1>Malocchia</h1>
<p>Malocchia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a striking visual contrast to the submerged roots. Malocchia is often found in slow-moving freshwater bodies and is revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both an ecological and cultural icon in South Asia.</p>
