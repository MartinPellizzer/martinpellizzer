                    <h1>Monorchis coiloglossa</h1>
<p>Monorchis coiloglossa, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that exhibit intricate color patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Monorchis coiloglossa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
