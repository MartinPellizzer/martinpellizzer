                    <h1>Montia clara</h1>
<p>Montia clara, commonly known as the silverleaf montia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically features small, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Montia clara is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a characteristic species of dry, open landscapes.</p>
