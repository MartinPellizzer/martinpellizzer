                    <h1>Matricaria subnivalis</h1>
<p>Matricaria subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing a mild, honey-like scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
