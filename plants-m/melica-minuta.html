                    <h1>Melica minuta</h1>
<p>Melica minuta, commonly known as dwarf brome, is a small annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and has slender, cylindrical stems covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with each containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Melica minuta is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a minor role in ecological systems as a forage plant for small mammals and insects.</p>
