                    <h1>Mendoncia litoralis</h1>
<p>Mendoncia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal mendoncia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for coastal ecosystem resilience.</p>
