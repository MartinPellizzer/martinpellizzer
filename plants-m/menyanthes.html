                    <h1>Menyanthes</h1>
<p>Menyanthes, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are broad and oval, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its aromatic, slightly resinous scent, which comes from compounds in its foliage.</p>
