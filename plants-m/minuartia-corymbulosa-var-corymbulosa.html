<p>Minuartia corymbulosa var. corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage, with fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, giving the plant its common name.</p>
