<p>Mikania hostmanii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a vine that grows rapidly, often climbing over other plants and forming dense mats. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native flora.</p>
