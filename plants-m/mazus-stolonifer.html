<p>Mazus stolonifer, commonly known as creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a soft, velvety texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Mazus stolonifer is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover bare soil and prevent erosion.</p>
