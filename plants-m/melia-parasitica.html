<p>Melia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic melia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Sapotaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on the roots or stems of other trees, such as those in the genus Ficus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fruit that is a capsule containing numerous seeds.</p>
