                    <h1>Medicago minima subvar. viscida</h1>
<p>Medicago minima subvar. viscida, commonly known as sticky medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sticky coating on the underside, which helps in retaining moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
