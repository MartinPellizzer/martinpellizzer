                    <h1>Mimosa reticulata</h1>
<p>Mimosa reticulata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of oval-shaped leaflets that are sensitive to touch, light, and temperature.</p>
<p>Mimosa reticulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and ability to respond to environmental stimuli.</p>
