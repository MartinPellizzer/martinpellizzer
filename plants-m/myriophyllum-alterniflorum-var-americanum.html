<p>Myriophyllum alterniflorum var. americanum, commonly known as American watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
