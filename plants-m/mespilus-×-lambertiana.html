                    <h1>Mespilus × lambertiana</h1>
<p>Mespilus × lambertiana, commonly known as the Lambert's medlar, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mespilus germanica and Mespilus americana.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3–6 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that ripen in the fall. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
