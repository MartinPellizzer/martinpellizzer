                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum teretiusculum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum teretiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
