                    <h1>Mahernia myrrhifolia</h1>
<p>Mahernia myrrhifolia, commonly known as the myrrh-leaved mahernia, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous leaves that emit a strong, balsamic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
