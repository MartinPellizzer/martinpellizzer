                    <h1>Mimosa lanceolata</h1>
<p>Mimosa lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Mimosa lanceolata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
