                    <h1>Microtrichomanes parvulum</h1>
<p>Microtrichomanes parvulum, commonly known as the small-horned fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found on trees or rocks in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific ecological requirements, it is a rare and specialized species within the fern family.</p>
