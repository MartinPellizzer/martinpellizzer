                    <h1>Myzorrhiza</h1>
<p>Myzorrhiza, commonly known as the mycorrhizal fungus, is a symbiotic association between fungi and plant roots.</p>
<p>This relationship enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, particularly phosphorus, from the soil. The fungi form a network of hyphae around and within the root cells, increasing the surface area for absorption. Myzorrhiza is crucial for the health and survival of many plant species in various ecosystems.</p>
<p>This mutualistic relationship has been observed in a wide range of plant families, including trees, shrubs, and grasses.</p>
