<p>Mulguraea aspera var. longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed mulguraea, is a rare and specialized plant found in arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its rough, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations include deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces, which help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
