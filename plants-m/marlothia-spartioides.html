                    <h1>Marlothia spartioides</h1>
<p>Marlothia spartioides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
