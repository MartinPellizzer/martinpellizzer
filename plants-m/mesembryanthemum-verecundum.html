<p>Mesembryanthemum verecundum, commonly known as the "garden ice plant," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation.</p>
