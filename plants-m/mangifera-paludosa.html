                    <h1>Mangifera paludosa</h1>
<p>Mangifera paludosa, commonly known as the swamp mango, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree bears edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits similar to those of the common mango, though they are typically smaller. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
