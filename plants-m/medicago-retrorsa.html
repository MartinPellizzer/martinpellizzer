                    <h1>Medicago retrorsa</h1>
<p>Medicago retrorsa, commonly known as the Turkey pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
