                    <h1>Molinia caerulea f. arundinacea</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea f. arundinacea, commonly known as the purple moorgrass, is a variant of the common moorgrass characterized by its striking purple-tinted foliage.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, acidic soils such as those in bogs and heathlands. The plant forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
