                            <h1>Melaleuca Costata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a unique and resilient plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays an important ecological role. The plant's ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its striking appearance and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
