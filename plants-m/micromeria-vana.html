                    <h1>Micromeria vana</h1>
<p>Micromeria vana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Micromeria vana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
