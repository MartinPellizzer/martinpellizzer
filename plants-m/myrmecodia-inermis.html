                    <h1>Myrmecodia inermis</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia inermis, commonly known as the naked ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants. The plant's structure mimics ant nests, creating a microhabitat that supports ant colonies, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores. Its leaves are small and clustered, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia inermis is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
