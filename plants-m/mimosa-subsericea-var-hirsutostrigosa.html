                    <h1>Mimosa subsericea var. hirsutostrigosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa subsericea var. hirsutostrigosa, commonly known as the hairy-stripped sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, typical of the Mimosa genus. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it the "hirsutostrigosa" designation, which refers to its hairy and strigose (rough) texture.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
