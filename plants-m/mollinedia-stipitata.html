                    <h1>Mollinedia stipitata</h1>
<p>Mollinedia stipitata, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Mollinedia stipitata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
