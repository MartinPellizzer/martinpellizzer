                    <h1>Metrosideros polymorpha f. pseudorugosa</h1>
<p>Metrosideros polymorpha f. pseudorugosa, commonly known as the Koa 'Pseudorugosa', is a variant of the native Hawaiian koa tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often darker and more rugged than those of the typical koa. This form thrives in the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's rainforests. The plant is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes other ornamental and economically important species.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for horticultural and ecological restoration projects in Hawaii.</p>
