<p>Mespilus sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai persimmon, is a small, deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that ripen in the autumn.
