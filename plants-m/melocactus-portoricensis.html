<p>Melocactus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican melon cactus, is a species native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive green body and a spiny, helmet-like structure at the top. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering and short, hooked spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to the dry, rocky habitats of its native environment.</p>
<p>Melocactus portoricensis is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stem, which helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
