                    <h1>Mentha × lamarckii var. hortivaga</h1>
<p>Mentha × lamarckii var. hortivaga, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Mentha viridis and Mentha spicata, resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and it emits a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses, as well as for ornamental purposes in gardens.</p>
