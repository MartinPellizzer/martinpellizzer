<p>Microsorum masaskei, commonly known as the Masanki fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while spreading along the substrate.</p>
<p>Microsorum masaskei is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance in planted aquariums.</p>
