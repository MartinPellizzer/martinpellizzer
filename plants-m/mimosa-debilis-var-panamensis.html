                    <h1>Mimosa debilis var. panamensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa debilis var. panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to touch and unique morphology, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
