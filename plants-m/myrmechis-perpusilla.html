<p>Myrmechis perpusilla, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Myrmechis perpusilla plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
