                    <h1>Mammillaria angularis f. compressa</h1>
<p>Mammillaria angularis f. compressa, commonly known as the compressed angular mammillaria, is a unique cactus species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, rounded tubercles.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-draining soils and full sun exposure. The plant features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise subdued appearance.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its compact size and ornamental value in succulent gardens.</p>
