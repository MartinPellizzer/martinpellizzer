<p>Mikania scandens var. rhodotricha, commonly known as the red-stemmed mile-a-minute weed, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is characterized by its distinctive red stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats contribute to its ecological impact.</p>
