                    <h1>Mogiphanes emarginata</h1>
<p>Mogiphanes emarginata, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mogiphanes emarginata plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting avian biodiversity.</p>
