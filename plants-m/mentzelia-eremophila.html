<p>Mentzelia eremophila, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Mentzelia eremophila is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
