                    <h1>Mollugo bainesii</h1>
<p>Mollugo bainesii, commonly known as the Baines' carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
