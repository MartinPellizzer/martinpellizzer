<p>Monochoria vaginalis var. korsakowii, commonly known as Korsakow's bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor water. Its roots are adapted for water absorption, and it often forms dense mats on the surface of still water bodies.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining water quality.</p>
