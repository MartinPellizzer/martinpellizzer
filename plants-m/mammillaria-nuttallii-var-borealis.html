                    <h1>Mammillaria nuttallii var. borealis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria nuttallii var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white to pale blue tubercles, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its bluish-green body. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and hardiness in cooler environments.</p>
