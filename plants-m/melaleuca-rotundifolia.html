                    <h1>Melaleuca rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca rotundifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which are often followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Melaleuca rotundifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
