                    <h1>Muellera fernandesii</h1>
<p>Muellera fernandesii, commonly known as the SÃ£o Paulo fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds that typically grow in a clustered formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Muellera fernandesii is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
