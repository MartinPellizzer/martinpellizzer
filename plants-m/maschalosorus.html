<p>Maschalosorus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Maschalosorus species are non-woody and have a lifecycle that includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
