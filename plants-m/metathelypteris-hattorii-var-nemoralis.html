<p>Metathelypteris hattorii var. nemoralis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
