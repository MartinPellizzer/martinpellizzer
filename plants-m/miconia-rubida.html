<p>Miconia rubida, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red fruits. Miconia rubida is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive potential have made it a concern in some regions where it is introduced.</p>
