                    <h1>Monochaetum vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Monochaetum vulcanicum, commonly known as the Vulcan Island spikegrass, is a rare grass species endemic to the volcanic island of Vulcano in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its volcanic habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
