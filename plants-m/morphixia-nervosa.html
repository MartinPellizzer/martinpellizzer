<p>Morphixia nervosa, commonly known as the veined morphix, is a perennial herb native to the humid forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>Morphixia nervosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
