                    <h1>Machaeranthera canescens var. monticola</h1>
<p>Machaeranthera canescens var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
