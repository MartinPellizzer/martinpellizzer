<p>Macrocnemum pilosinervium, commonly known as the hairy-veined water plant, is a flowering plant species native to wetland and marshy environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often floating stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with hairy veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in shallow water or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Macrocnemum pilosinervium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
