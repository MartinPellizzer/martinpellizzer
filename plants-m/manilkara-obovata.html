<p>Manilkara obovata, commonly known as the wild sapodilla, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces a fleshy, edible fruit with a sweet, creamy pulp and a hard, starchy seed inside. Its latex, similar to that of the common sapodilla, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
