<p>Manihot jolyana, commonly known as the Joly's manioc, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots, similar to other manioc species, contain high levels of starch and are used as a food source.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful processing before consumption.</p>
