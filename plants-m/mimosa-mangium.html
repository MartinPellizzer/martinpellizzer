                    <h1>Mimosa mangium</h1>
<p>Mimosa mangium, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, flat pods containing several seeds. It is often used in reforestation and as a source of timber and fodder due to its hardy nature and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
