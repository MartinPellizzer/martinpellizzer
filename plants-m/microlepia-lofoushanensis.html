                    <h1>Microlepia lofoushanensis</h1>
<p>Microlepia lofoushanensis, commonly known as the Lofoushan water fern, is a rare species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
