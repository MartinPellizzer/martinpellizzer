<p>Mediocactus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant saguaro, is a striking cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, ribbed trunk and a crown of large, spiny leaves that resemble arms. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Mediocactus megalanthus has a slow growth rate and can live for over 150 years, making it a long-lived and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations to arid environments make it a notable feature of the desert landscape.</p>
