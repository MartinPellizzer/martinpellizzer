                    <h1>Mimosa simplex</h1>
<p>Mimosa simplex, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa simplex is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and delicate appearance.</p>
