                    <h1>Mimosa pudica f. glabrior</h1>
<p>Mimosa pudica f. glabrior, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a variant of the sensitive plant characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to South America. Its leaves are compound and consist of multiple small leaflets that fold together when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The flowers are usually small and pink or purple, arranged in spherical clusters.</p>
<p>The glabrous (smooth) appearance of its leaves distinguishes this form from other mimosa species.</p>
