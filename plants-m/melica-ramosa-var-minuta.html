<p>Melica ramosa var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf beardless grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in native gardens.</p>
