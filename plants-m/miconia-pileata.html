<p>Miconia pileata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
