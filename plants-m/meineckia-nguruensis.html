                    <h1>Meineckia nguruensis</h1>
<p>Meineckia nguruensis, commonly known as the Nguru mountain fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Nguru Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated edge and a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meineckia nguruensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
