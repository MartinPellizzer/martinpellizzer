<p>Melampyrum commutatum, commonly known as yellow false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants.</p>
