<p>Micropolypodium zurquinum, commonly known as the zurquin fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
