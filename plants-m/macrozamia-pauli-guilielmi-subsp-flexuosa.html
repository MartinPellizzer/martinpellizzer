<p>Macrozamia pauli-guilielmi subsp.</p>
<p>flexuosa, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its robust, segmented trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
