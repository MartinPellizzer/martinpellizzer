                    <h1>Mimosa nobilis</h1>
<p>Mimosa nobilis, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats.</p>
