                    <h1>Musa acuminata var. alasensis</h1>
<p>Musa acuminata var. alasensis, commonly known as the Alasense banana, is a wild banana species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of elongated, yellowish-green fruits. The plant is a diploid species with a genome size that is relatively small compared to other banana varieties. It is often used in breeding programs to improve disease resistance in cultivated bananas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it plays an important role in the conservation of banana genetic resources.</p>
