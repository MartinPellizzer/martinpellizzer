<p>Mikania hookeriana var. kittsiana, commonly known as the Kitts's mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can spread rapidly, often covering large areas in a short time. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy.
