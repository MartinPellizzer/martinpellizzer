<p>Melaleuca ctenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca ctenoides is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
