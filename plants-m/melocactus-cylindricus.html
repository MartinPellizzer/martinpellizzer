<p>Melocactus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to three meters in height. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, melon-like fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The cactus also features a spiny crown that provides protection from herbivores.</p>
