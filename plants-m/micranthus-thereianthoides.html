                    <h1>Micranthus thereianthoides</h1>
<p>Micranthus thereianthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period makes it a notable plant in its native habitat, though it is not widely cultivated outside of its natural range.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
