                    <h1>Marsilea scalaripes</h1>
<p>Marsilea scalaripes, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia and now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with spores produced in specialized structures called sporocarps. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Marsilea scalaripes include its unique leaf morphology and reproductive strategy, which contribute to its ecological impact.</p>
