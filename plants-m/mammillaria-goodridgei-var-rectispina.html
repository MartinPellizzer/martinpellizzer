                    <h1>Mammillaria goodridgei var. rectispina</h1>
<p>Mammillaria goodridgei var. rectispina, commonly known as the Goodridge's mammilla, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
