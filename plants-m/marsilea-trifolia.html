<p>Marsilea trifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, typically with four lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structure includes small, spore-producing structures called sporocarps, which are often found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea trifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
