<p>Marsilea macrocarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are often mistaken for the common lucky clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, floating fruits that release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Marsilea macrocarpa is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
