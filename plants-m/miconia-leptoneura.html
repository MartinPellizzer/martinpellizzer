                    <h1>Miconia leptoneura</h1>
<p>Miconia leptoneura, commonly known as the slender-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
