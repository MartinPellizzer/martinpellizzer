                    <h1>Mentha longifolia f. apoxodonta</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia f. apoxodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a botanical variant of the mint genus characterized by its slender, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to typical mint species, with smaller, pointed leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in terminal clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and aromatic properties, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes.</p>
