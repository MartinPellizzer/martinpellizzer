                    <h1>Mistyllus</h1>
<p>Mistyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint iridescence, giving it an otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that emit a subtle bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the humid air rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Mistyllus is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat.</p>
