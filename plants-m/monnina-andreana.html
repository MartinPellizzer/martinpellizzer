<p>Monnina andreana, commonly known as the Andean bluemink, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monnina andreana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
