                    <h1>Meriania ramosii</h1>
<p>Meriania ramosii, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Eucalyptus*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Meriania ramosii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
