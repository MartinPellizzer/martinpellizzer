<p>Melocactus salmianus var. contractus, commonly known as the contracted melocactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to Mexico.</p>

The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and requiring minimal watering.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
