<p>Microtatorchis occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale in color, resembling a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows on the surfaces of tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphyte rather than a terrestrial plant. Its botanical features include a short, fleshy stem and specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
