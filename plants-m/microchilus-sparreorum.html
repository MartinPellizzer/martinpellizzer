Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. The plant's compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant ecology.</p>
