                    <h1>Melasma alectroides</h1>
<p>Melasma alectroides, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>It features small, elongated leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with capsules that release spores in a dry, wind-dispersed manner.</p>
<p>Melasma alectroides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
