<p>Medicago polymorpha var. scutellata, commonly known as the scarlet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and oblong, with a distinctive scutellate (shield-like) structure on the seed coat.</p>
