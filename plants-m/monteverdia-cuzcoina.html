                    <h1>Monteverdia cuzcoina</h1>
<p>Monteverdia cuzcoina, commonly known as the Cuzco mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Monteverdia cuzcoina is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
