<p>Melanthium dioicum, commonly known as the male fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, with the female plants producing the showy, spadix-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are hollow and segmented.</p>
<p>Melanthium dioicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
