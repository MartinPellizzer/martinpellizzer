                    <h1>Myriopteris hirta</h1>
<p>Myriopteris hirta, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny environments, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Myriopteris hirta plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and supports local biodiversity.</p>
