                    <h1>Myrmecostylum</h1>
<p>Myrmecostylum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique adaptations that facilitate a symbiotic relationship with ants. The plant produces nectar-secreting structures called extrafloral nectaries, which attract and nourish ants. These ants, in turn, provide protection against herbivores and competing plants.</p>
<p>Myrmecostylum species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
