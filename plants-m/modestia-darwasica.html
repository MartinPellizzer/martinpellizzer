<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescence. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are typically pale green or white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Modestia darwasica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
