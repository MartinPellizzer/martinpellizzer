                    <h1>Medicago borealis var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Medicago borealis var. micrantha, commonly known as the northern sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the colder regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and oval, typically dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
