                    <h1>Mahonia</h1>
<p>Mahonia, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to the western United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, often with spiny tips, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Mahonia species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to provide winter interest in the landscape.</p>
