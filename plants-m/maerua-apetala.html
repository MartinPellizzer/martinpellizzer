                    <h1>Maerua apetala</h1>
<p>Maerua apetala, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry environments.</p>
<p>Maerua apetala is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
