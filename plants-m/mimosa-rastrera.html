<p>Mimosa rastrera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with branching stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height.</p>
<p>Mimosa rastrera thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
