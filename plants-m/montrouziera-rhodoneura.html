                    <h1>Montrouziera rhodoneura</h1>
<p>Montrouziera rhodoneura, commonly known as the red-veined montrouziera, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with bright red veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Montrouziera rhodoneura is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
