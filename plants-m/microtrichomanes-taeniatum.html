<p>Microtrichomanes taeniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species in the study of epiphytic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas.</p>
