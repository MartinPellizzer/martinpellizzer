<p>It features a dense covering of white to light green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spines are long and slender, often varying in color from white to reddish-brown.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
