                    <h1>Mangifera merrillii</h1>
<p>Mangifera merrillii, commonly known as the Malay mango, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible mango fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic compared to common mango varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited fruit size, it is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit.</p>
