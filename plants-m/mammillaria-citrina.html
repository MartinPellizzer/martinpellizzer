                    <h1>Mammillaria citrina</h1>
<p>Mammillaria citrina, commonly known as the yellow globular cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, globular stem covered in white to yellow tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are followed by pale pink or white fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
