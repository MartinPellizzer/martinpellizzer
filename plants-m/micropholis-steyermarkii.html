                    <h1>Micropholis steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Micropholis steyermarkii, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
