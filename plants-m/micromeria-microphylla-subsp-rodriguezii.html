<p>Micromeria microphylla subsp.</p>
<p>rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez's narrowleaf micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like species characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
