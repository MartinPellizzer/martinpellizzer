                    <h1>Myriactis cuchumatanica</h1>
<p>Myriactis cuchumatanica, commonly known as the Cuchumatanica Myriactis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myriaptyllaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
