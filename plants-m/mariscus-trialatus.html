                    <h1>Mariscus trialatus</h1>
<p>Mariscus trialatus, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
