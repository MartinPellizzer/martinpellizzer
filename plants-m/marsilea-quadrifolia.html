                    <h1>Marsilea quadrifolia</h1>
<p>Marsilea quadrifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with four small, heart-shaped leaves arranged around a central stem. This plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its floating leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Marsilea quadrifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
