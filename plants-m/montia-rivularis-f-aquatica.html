<p>Montia rivularis f. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic water-penny.</p>
<p>This variant is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant exhibits a simple, branching stem with no true roots, relying on its leaves for anchorage.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to aquatic conditions, with reduced stomata and a high capacity for oxygen exchange.</p>
