<p>Macroblepharus contractus, commonly known as the contracted-eyed frog.</p>
<p>This species is a small, terrestrial amphibian found in the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulging eyes and a body covered in smooth, moist skin. The plant associated with this frog is not a plant but an amphibian, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
