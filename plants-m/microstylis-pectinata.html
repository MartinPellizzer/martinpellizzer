<p>Microstylis pectinata, commonly known as the silky microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
