<p>Masdevallia cylix, commonly known as the Cylix orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
