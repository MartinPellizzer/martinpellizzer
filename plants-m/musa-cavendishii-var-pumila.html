<p>Musa cavendishii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf banana plant, is a variety of the banana genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, producing small, edible berries rather than the large, fleshy bananas typical of other Musa species. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, making it well-suited for container gardening or small spaces. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit, which is often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
