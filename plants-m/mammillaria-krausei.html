                    <h1>Mammillaria krausei</h1>
<p>Mammillaria krausei, commonly known as the Krause's pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
