<p>Maerua arenaria var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
