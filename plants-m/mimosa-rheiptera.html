<p>Mimosa rheiptera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa rheiptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit.</p>
