<p>Miraglossum pilosum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
