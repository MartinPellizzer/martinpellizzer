                    <h1>Malaxis katangensis var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Malaxis katangensis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the Pygmy Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically on short, erect stems. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, ovate leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It is often found in forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
