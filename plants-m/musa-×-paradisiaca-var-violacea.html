                    <h1>Musa × paradisiaca var. violacea</h1>
<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. violacea, commonly known as the purple banana, is a striking variant of the banana plant characterized by its deep violet to almost black foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, resulting in its unique coloration. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture and a prominent midrib. While it produces edible fruit, the flowers and foliage are the primary ornamental features.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
