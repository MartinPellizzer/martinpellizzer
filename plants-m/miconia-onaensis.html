                    <h1>Miconia onaensis</h1>
<p>Miconia onaensis, commonly known as the Ona miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the islands of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
