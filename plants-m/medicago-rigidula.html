                <h1>Medicago rigidula</h1>
<p>Medicago rigidula, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Medicago rigidula plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
