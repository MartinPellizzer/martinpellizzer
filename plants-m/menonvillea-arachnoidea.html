                    <h1>Menonvillea arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Menonvillea arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-tendril orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy, spider-like tendrils that help it climb and anchor to tree bark. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinct, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
