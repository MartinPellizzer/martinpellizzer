<p>Macleania sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. It relies on a host tree for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in the study of plant parasitism and biodiversity.</p>
