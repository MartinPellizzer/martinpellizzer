<p>Meliosma pinnata subsp.</p>
<p>sylvatica, commonly known as the silverleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect light and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
