                    <h1>Mikania corymbiifolia</h1>
<p>Mikania corymbiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
