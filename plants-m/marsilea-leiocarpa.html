                    <h1>Marsilea leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Marsilea leiocarpa, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used as a water purifier in ponds and aquariums. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize large areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sporocarps, which are enclosed in a protective capsule, facilitating its reproduction in aquatic habitats.</p>
