<p>Mikania thapsoides var. robusta, commonly known as the robust horseweed, is a perennial vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive invasive species. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
