                    <h1>Marsilea gracilenta</h1>
<p>Marsilea gracilenta, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that resemble clover, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in ponds and wetlands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential weed in aquatic environments.</p>
