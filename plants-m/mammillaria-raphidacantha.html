                    <h1>Mammillaria raphidacantha</h1>
<p>Mammillaria raphidacantha, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact stem with short, cylindrical ribs and prominent areoles, from which white, silky glochids (hairs) emerge. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or summer, which are borne on short, lateral pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and spines that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
