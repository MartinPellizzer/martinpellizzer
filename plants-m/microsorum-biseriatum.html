<p>Microsorum biseriatum, commonly known as the two-ranked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are arranged in two distinct rows along the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum biseriatum is valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ease of care.</p>
