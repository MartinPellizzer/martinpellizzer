<p>Mesembryanthemum cleistum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum cleistum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in dry regions.</p>
