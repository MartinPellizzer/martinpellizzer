<p>Mimosa aculeaticarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in ion flow and turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa aculeaticarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit.</p>
