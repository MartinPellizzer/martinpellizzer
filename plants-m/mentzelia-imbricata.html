<p>Mentzelia imbricata, commonly known as the silverleaf bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with tubular corollas that curve backward, giving it the common name "bluecurls.".</p>
<p>Mentzelia imbricata is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
