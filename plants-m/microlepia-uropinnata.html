<p>Microlepia uropinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in wetlands and slow-moving water bodies. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Microlepia uropinnata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
