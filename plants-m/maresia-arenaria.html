<p>Maresia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Maresia arenaria plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
