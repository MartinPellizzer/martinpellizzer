                    <h1>Macrozamia cranei</h1>
<p>Macrozamia cranei, commonly known as the Carnaby's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones that are typically found in clusters at the base of the leaves. Macrozamia cranei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
