<p>Microcorys queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland microcorys, is a rare and specialized plant endemic to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered inflorescences bearing small white or pale green flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
