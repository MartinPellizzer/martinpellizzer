                            <h1>Melaleuca Albiflora</h1>
<p>Whiteflower paperbark, scientifically known as Melaleuca albiflora, is a unique and striking plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. Its most notable feature is its white, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in late winter and early spring, creating a striking visual contrast against its papery, peeling bark. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and coastal heathlands, where it plays an important ecological role. The plant's ability to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an adaptable and resilient species. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to other melaleuca species, making it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
