<p>Mezleria dregeana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily in the wind. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mezleria dregeana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
