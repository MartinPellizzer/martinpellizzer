                    <h1>Monotropa nipponica</h1>
<p>Monotropa nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore appears pale or ghostly in appearance. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role and delicate appearance make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
