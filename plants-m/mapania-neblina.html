                    <h1>Mapania neblina</h1>
<p>Mapania neblina, commonly known as the misty mapania, is a rare tropical plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that are adapted to thrive in high humidity and low light conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
