                            <h1>Myosotis Palustris Subsp. Lithuanica</h1>
<p>Myosotis palustris subsp. lithuanica is a rare and delicate plant native to the wetlands of Lithuania. It belongs to the Myosotis genus, commonly known as forget-me-nots, and is distinguished by its small, blue or purple flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes. Its presence is a sign of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
