<p>Monadenium torrei, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Monadenium torrei is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
