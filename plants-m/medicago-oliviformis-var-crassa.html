                    <h1>Medicago oliviformis var. crassa</h1>
<p>Medicago oliviformis var. crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf Medicago, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
