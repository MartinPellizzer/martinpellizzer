<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the trailing water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It features small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in shallow water or damp meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
