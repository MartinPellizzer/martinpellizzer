<p>Mesembryanthemum cronemeyerianum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture quickly. It produces a dense carpet of foliage, often covering rocky soils in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
