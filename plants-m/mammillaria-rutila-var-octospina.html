<p>Mammillaria rutila var. octospina, commonly known as the eight-spined white globular cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 7 centimeters, with a spherical shape and a smooth, pale green body. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements.</p>
