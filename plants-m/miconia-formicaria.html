                    <h1>Miconia formicaria</h1>
<p>Miconia formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a common sight in rainforests.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact.</p>
