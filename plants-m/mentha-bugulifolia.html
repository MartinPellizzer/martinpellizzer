<p>Mentha bugulifolia, commonly known as bog mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often kidney-shaped or elliptic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves.</p>
<p>Mentha bugulifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
