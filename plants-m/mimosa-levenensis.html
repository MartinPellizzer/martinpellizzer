                    <h1>Mimosa levenensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa levenensis, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Mimosa levenensis is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it an important plant in soil stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>
