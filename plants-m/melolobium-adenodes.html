                    <h1>Melolobium adenodes</h1>
<p>Melolobium adenodes, commonly known as the stickyleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glandular-armed leaves that exude a sticky substance. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spherical, spiky seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and moisture retention.</p>
