<p>Meconostigma, commonly known as the "false nettle," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, typically found in the axils of the leaves. Meconostigma species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>These plants are not typically cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
