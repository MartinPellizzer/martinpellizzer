                    <h1>Mimosa pilosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa pilosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light and touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Mimosa pilosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and unique movement.</p>
