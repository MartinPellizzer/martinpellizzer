The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and meadows.</p>
<p>Its presence indicates a nutrient-rich environment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules.</p>
