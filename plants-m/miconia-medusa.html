The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features contribute to its ecological impact and make it a subject of both scientific study and concern.</p>
