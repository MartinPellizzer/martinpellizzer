                    <h1>Manilkara udoido</h1>
<p>Manilkara udoido, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a thick, inedible outer husk enclosing a single, hard-shelled seed. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a significant species in the timber industry.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
