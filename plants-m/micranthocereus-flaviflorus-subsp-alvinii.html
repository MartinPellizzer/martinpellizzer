<p>Micranthocereus flaviflorus subsp.</p>
<p>alvinii, commonly known as the Alvin's yellow-flowered cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to a limited geographic region in South America, specifically in parts of Brazil.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic differences from the main species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
