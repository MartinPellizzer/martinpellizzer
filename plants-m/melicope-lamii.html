<p>Melicope lamii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native forests. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that mature to a dark purple color, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Melicope lamii is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
