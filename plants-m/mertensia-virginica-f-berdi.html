                    <h1>Mertensia virginica f. berdi</h1>
<p>Mertensia virginica f. berdi, commonly known as the Berdi bluebells, is a rare and reclusive variant of the common bluebells native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring before the canopy of the forest closes. It typically grows in moist, rich soils under shade, often in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions.</p>
