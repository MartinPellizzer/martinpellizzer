<p>Melaleuca conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Melaleuca conferta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
