                    <h1>Mimosa pumila</h1>
<p>Mimosa pumila, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Mimosa pumila is often found in open woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
