                    <h1>Missiessya sumatrana</h1>
<p>Missiessya sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as dipterocarps, through specialized roots called haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Missiessya sumatrana plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
