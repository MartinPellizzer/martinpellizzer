                    <h1>Melasma rigidum</h1>
<p>Melasma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, woody structure.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, a symbiotic organism formed by a partnership between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks. Its rigid, crust-like morphology provides protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Melasma rigidum is often found in temperate and tropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
