<p>Mimosa suma, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous tiny leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern.</p>
<p>Mimosa suma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
