<p>Melocactus approximatus, commonly known as the "bottle cactus," is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a distinctive, bottle-like shape. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Melocactus approximatus produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits.</p>
