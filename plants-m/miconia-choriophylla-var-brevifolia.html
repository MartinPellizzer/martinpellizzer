<p>Miconia choriophylla var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions.</p>
