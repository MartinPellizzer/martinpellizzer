                    <h1>Manilkara tabogaensis</h1>
<p>Manilkara tabogaensis, commonly known as the Taboga mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a thick, inedible pulp surrounding a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich, golden color, making it a sought-after timber species.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
