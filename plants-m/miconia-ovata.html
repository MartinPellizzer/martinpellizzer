                    <h1>Miconia ovata</h1>
<p>Miconia ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia ovata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant ecology and invasive species management.</p>
