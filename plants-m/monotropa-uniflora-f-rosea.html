                    <h1>Monotropa uniflora f. rosea</h1>
<p>Monotropa uniflora f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered ghostplant, is a rare variant of the ghostplant species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its most distinctive feature is its pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with its white, leafless stems. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing in association with host trees like oaks and maples.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
