                    <h1>Mentha arvensis var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Mentha arvensis var. decipiens, commonly known as false mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the upper stem. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a serrated edge and a fragrant, mint-like aroma.</p>
<p>While it resembles true mint species, it is distinguished by its smaller size and less intense scent.</p>
