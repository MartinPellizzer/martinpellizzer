<p>Miconia ceramicarpa, commonly known as the porcelain miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have made it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is part of the Melastomataceae family, known for its showy flowers and ecological impact.</p>
