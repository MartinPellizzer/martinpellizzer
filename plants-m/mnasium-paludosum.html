<p>Mnasium paludosum, commonly known as the bog moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in wet, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. The plant has small, closely packed leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Mnasium paludosum is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
