                    <h1>Myristica pumila</h1>
<p>Myristica pumila, commonly known as the dwarf nutmeg tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, orange-red berries. The plant produces a seed enclosed in a hard, aromatic shell, similar to the nutmeg of its larger relative, Myristica fragrans. Myristica pumila is typically found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
