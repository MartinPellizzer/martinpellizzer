                    <h1>Mammillaria alversonii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the rocky soils of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts.</p>
