                    <h1>Mentha × lugosiensis</h1>
<p>Mentha × lugosiensis, commonly known as the Hungarian mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha pulegium and Mentha longifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like scent and its preference for moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, pungent fragrance.</p>
<p>Mentha × lugosiensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species.</p>
