                    <h1>Molinia caerulea var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant produces dense clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, zigzagging stems. One of its notable features is its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds develop while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, acidic soils in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
