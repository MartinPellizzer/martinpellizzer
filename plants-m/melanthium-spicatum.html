<p>Melanthium spicatum, commonly known as the spicate melanthium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>Melanthium spicatum is often mistaken for other grasses due to its similar appearance, but it can be identified by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
