                    <h1>Mikania porosa</h1>
<p>Mikania porosa, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, and its fibrous roots and prolific seed production contribute to its ecological impact.</p>
