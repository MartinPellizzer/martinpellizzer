<p>Mimosa dolens, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seed pods that burst open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
