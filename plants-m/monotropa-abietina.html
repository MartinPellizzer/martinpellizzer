                    <h1>Monotropa abietina</h1>
<p>Monotropa abietina, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is often found in shaded, forested areas where it grows in association with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Despite its ghostly appearance, it plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
