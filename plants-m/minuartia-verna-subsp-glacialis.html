<p>Minuartia verna subsp.</p>
<p>glacialis, commonly known as the glacier wintergreen, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
