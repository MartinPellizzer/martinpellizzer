                    <h1>Monotropastrum humile var. tripetalum</h1>
<p>Monotropastrum humile var. tripetalum, commonly known as the tripetal mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
