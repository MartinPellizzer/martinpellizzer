<p>Mesadenella cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its elongated, slender body with a cluster of long, pointed tentacles. The organism lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, attaching itself to substrates like coral or rock. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of yellow, orange, or red, which may serve as camouflage or for attracting prey.</p>
<p>Mesadenella cuspidata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments.</p>
