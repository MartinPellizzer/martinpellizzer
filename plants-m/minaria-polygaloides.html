                    <h1>Minaria polygaloides</h1>
<p>Minaria polygaloides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Minaria polygaloides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
