                    <h1>Morus alba var. pendula</h1>
<p>Morus alba var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping mulberry, is a cultivar of the white mulberry tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that hang like a weeping willow.</p>
<p>This variety is native to China and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and often used in jams and wines. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The weeping mulberry is also valued for its role in silk production, as its leaves are a primary food source for silkworms.</p>
