<p>Miconia velutina, commonly known as velvet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries.
