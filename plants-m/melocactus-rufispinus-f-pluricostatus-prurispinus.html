<p>Melocactus rufispinus f. pluricostatus-prurispinus, commonly known as the Prickly Cactus or the Red-spined Melocactus, is a unique variant of the Melocactus genus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, reddish spines that give it its common name. The plant exhibits a distinctive rib structure, with multiple prominent costae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
