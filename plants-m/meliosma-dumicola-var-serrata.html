                    <h1>Meliosma dumicola var. serrata</h1>
<p>Meliosma dumicola var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated meliosma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
