                    <h1>Mentha pulegium var. humifusa</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium var. humifusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a strong, pungent essential oil, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and potential toxicity to livestock.</p>
