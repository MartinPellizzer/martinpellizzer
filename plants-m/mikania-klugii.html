                    <h1>Mikania klugii</h1>
<p>Mikania klugii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a fibrous root system and can spread rapidly through runners, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to climb various structures make it both ecologically significant and challenging to control.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in moist, sunny habitats.</p>
