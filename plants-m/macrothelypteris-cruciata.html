                    <h1>Macrothelypteris cruciata</h1>
<p>Macrothelypteris cruciata, commonly known as the cross-veined huperzia, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The cross-shaped veins in its leaves are a key identifying feature, contributing to its scientific name.</p>
