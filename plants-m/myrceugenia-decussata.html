                    <h1>Myrceugenia decussata</h1>
<p>Myrceugenia decussata, commonly known as the strawberry guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Brazil and is characterized by its evergreen leaves that are opposite and decussate, meaning they are arranged in pairs at right angles. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, pinkish-red berries that are highly aromatic. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
