                    <h1>Mesosphaerum subrotundum</h1>
<p>Mesosphaerum subrotundum, commonly known as the smooth globular cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spherical stem covered in short, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, it requires careful handling due to its sharp spines and limited habitat.</p>
