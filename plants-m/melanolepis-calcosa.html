                    <h1>Melanolepis calcosa</h1>
<p>Melanolepis calcosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Melanolepis calcosa is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.</p>
