                            <h1>Moraea Longifolia</h1>
<p>Moraea longifolia is a striking member of the Iridaceae family known for its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. Its long, slender stems and delicate foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners and botanists alike. The plant blooms in late summer, producing clusters of colorful blooms that range from white to deep purple. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Moraea longifolia is both admired and studied for its role in native ecosystems.</p>
