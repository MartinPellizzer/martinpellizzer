<p>Miconia rabenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wet forest habitats, often in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It produces berries that are often eaten by native birds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions but is considered invasive in some areas.</p>
