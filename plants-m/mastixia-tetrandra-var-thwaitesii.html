                    <h1>Mastixia tetrandra var. thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Mastixia tetrandra var. thwaitesii, commonly known as the Tasmanian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Tasmania.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which allow it to extract water and nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecosystem by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
