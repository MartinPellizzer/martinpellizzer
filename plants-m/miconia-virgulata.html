                    <h1>Miconia virgulata</h1>
<p>Miconia virgulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
