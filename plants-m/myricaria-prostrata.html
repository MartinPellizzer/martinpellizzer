<p>Myricaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate myricaria, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Myricaria prostrata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
