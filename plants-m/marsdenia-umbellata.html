<p>Marsdenia umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and fleshy, angular stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, hairy seed pods. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
