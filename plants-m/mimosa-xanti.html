                    <h1>Mimosa xanti</h1>
<p>Mimosa xanti, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and ornamental appeal make it a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
