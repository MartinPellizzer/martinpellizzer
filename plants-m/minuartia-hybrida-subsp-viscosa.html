<p>Minuartia hybrida subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the sticky rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular, sticky leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
