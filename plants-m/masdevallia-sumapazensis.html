                    <h1>Masdevallia sumapazensis</h1>
<p>Masdevallia sumapazensis, commonly known as the Sumapaz masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
