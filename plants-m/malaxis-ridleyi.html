                    <h1>Malaxis ridleyi</h1>
<p>Malaxis ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, terrestrial growth habit and its unique, pale greenish-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, elongated pseudobulbs and has delicate, strap-like leaves that help it survive in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days before withering, making it a challenging species to observe in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Malaxis ridleyi is considered a critically endangered plant.</p>
