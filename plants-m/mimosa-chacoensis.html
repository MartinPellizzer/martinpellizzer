<p>Mimosa chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dry grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
