                    <h1>Medicago obscura var. microdon</h1>
<p>Medicago obscura var. microdon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burclover, is a perennial forage plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in pasture and erosion control.</p>
