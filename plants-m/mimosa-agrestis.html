                    <h1>Mimosa agrestis</h1>
<p>Mimosa agrestis, commonly known as the field mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa agrestis is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
