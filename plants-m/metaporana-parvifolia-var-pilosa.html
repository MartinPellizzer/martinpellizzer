<p>Metaporana parvifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf metaporana, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves also helps in reducing water loss, making it adaptable to drier environments.</p>
