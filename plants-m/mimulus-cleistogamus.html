                    <h1>Mimulus cleistogamus</h1>
<p>Mimulus cleistogamus, commonly known as the cleistogamous monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closed (cleistogamous) flowers that do not open, a reproductive strategy that ensures self-pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are oval and arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces bright yellow flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive biology and ecological adaptations.</p>
