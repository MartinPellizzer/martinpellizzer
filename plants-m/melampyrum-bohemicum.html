                    <h1>Melampyrum bohemicum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum bohemicum, commonly known as the Bohemian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces bright orange-red flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
