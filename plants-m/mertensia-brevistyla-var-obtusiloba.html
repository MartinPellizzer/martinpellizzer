<p>Mertensia brevistyla var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
