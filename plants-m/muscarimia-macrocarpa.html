                    <h1>Muscarimia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Muscarimia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Lepiota.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, spherical cap that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The fruiting body is typically smooth and firm, with a dense, white spore mass inside when mature. It is often found in grassy areas and woodlands, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that while some species of Muscarimia are edible, others can be toxic, so identification should be done with caution.</p>
