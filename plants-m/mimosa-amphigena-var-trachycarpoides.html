                    <h1>Mimosa amphigena var. trachycarpoides</h1>
<p>Mimosa amphigena var. trachycarpoides, commonly known as the rough-seeded mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its leaflets to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by woody, spiny pods. Its growth habit is typically sprawling or prostrate, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
