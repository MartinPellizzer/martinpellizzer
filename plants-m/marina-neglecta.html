<p>Marina neglecta, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Marina neglecta is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in saline environments, making it a common sight along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important plant in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
