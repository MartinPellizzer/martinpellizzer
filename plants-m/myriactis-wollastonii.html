                    <h1>Myriactis wollastonii</h1>
<p>Myriactis wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant is native to the wet tropical forests of northern Australia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Myriactis wollastonii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
