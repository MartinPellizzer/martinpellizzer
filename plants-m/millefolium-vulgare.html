                    <h1>Millefolium vulgare</h1>
<p>Millefolium vulgare, commonly known as common yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome and erect, branched stems that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are pinnately divided into numerous thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Common yarrow is often found in dry meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
