                    <h1>Medicago × ladak</h1>
<p>Medicago × ladak, commonly known as the Ladak clover, is a hybrid perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, showcasing a deep root system for water absorption. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other clover species due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
