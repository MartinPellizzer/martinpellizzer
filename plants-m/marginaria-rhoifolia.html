<p>Marginaria rhoifolia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Marginaria rhoifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
