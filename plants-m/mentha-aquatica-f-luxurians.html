<p>Mentha aquatica f. luxurians, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the aquatic mint plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats.</p>
