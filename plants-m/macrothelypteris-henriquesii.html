                    <h1>Macrothelypteris henriquesii</h1>
<p>Macrothelypteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
