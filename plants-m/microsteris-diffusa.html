                    <h1>Microsteris diffusa</h1>
<p>Microsteris diffusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Microsteris diffusa is classified as an endangered species due to habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
