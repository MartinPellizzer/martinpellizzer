                    <h1>Marcetia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Marcetia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its showy, violet-blue flowers are arranged in a spike and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Marcetia glandulosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
