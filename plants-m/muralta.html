<p>Muralta, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Muralta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
