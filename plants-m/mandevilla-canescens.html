<p>Mandevilla canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and produces clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often used in ornamental gardening for its showy blooms and ability to cover trellises or walls. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Mandevilla canescens is also valued for its fragrance and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
