                    <h1>Miconia ciliaris</h1>
<p>Miconia ciliaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Miconia ciliaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
