<p>Miconia tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with four distinct veins, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically bright red or purple and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
