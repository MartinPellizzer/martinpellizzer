                    <h1>Malus rossica</h1>
<p>Malus rossica, commonly known as the Siberian crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pink. The tree produces small, tart apples that are typically not suitable for eating raw but are used in traditional jams and preserves. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn a striking yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Malus rossica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cold climates.</p>
