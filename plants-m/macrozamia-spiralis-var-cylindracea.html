<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
