                    <h1>Mangifera dewildei</h1>
<p>Mangifera dewildei, commonly known as the Dewilde mango, is a rare and little-known species within the mango genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow. The fruit is generally smaller than common mangoes and has a distinct, often fibrous pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered endangered and of significant botanical interest.</p>
