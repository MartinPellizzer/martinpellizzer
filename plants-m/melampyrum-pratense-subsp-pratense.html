<p>Melampyrum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>pratense, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing grass dominance.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is an important food source for various insects and birds.</p>
