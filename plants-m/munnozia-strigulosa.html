<p>Munnozia strigulosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Munnozia strigulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
