<p>Mediocactus extensus, commonly known as the extended medium cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often branching out into a bushy form. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically followed by small, red fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Mediocactus extensus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
