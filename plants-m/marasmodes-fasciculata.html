<p>Marasmodes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring grass-like leaves and a flowering spike that bears small, pale green or white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in saturated soils, and its flowers are often clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
