<p>Missiessya bimensis, commonly known as the two-month mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and its flowers are white or pale green, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it an important ecological consideration in forest ecosystems.</p>
