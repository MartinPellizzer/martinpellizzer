                    <h1>Mentha × amphioxya</h1>
<p>Mentha × amphioxya, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Mentha × piperita (peppermint) and Mentha × cunninghamii (wild mint), resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they emit a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments.</p>
