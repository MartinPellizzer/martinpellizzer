                    <h1>Melocactus inconcinnus</h1>
<p>Melocactus inconcinnus, commonly known as the red-hair melon, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered with dense, reddish-brown spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus inconcinnus is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
