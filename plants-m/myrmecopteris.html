                    <h1>Myrmecopteris</h1>
<p>Myrmecopteris, commonly known as the fern moss or cushion fern, is a genus of small, mat-forming plants belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Myrmecopteris species are characterized by their delicate, intricately branched fronds and small, scale-like leaves. They often grow in dense clusters, forming compact cushions that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and ecological role, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
