<p>Miconia pilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia pilosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
