                    <h1>Malus sieversii f. flava</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii f. flava, commonly known as the yellow apple or golden apple, is a naturally occurring variant of the wild apple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or golden foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of other Malus species. This plant is native to Central Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The leaves are often broader and more elongated compared to the standard species, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely cultivated for fruit, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and genetic diversity.</p>
