<p>Macroptilium psammodes, commonly known as the sand senna, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, creeping stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant.</p>
