<p>Mollugo trigona, commonly known as the three-lobed carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with three petals, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive three-lobed shape, and are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Mollugo trigona is often found in lawns, along paths, and in other areas with compacted soil, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
