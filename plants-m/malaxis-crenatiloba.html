                    <h1>Malaxis crenatiloba</h1>
<p>Malaxis crenatiloba, commonly known as the wavy-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis crenatiloba is considered a conservation concern.</p>
