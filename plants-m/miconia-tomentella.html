                    <h1>Miconia tomentella</h1>
<p>Miconia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
