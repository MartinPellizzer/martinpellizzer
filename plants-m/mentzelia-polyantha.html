<p>Mentzelia polyantha, commonly known as the many-flowered blazingstar, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular, often pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mentzelia polyantha plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
