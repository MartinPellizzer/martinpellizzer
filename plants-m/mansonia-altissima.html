<p>Mansonia altissima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, which float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems are adapted for buoyancy.</p>
<p>Mansonia altissima plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies.</p>
