                    <h1>Melocactus neoviridescens</h1>
<p>Melocactus neoviridescens, commonly known as the green melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically green and covered with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
