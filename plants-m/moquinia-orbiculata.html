                    <h1>Moquinia orbiculata</h1>
<p>Moquinia orbiculata, commonly known as the broad-leafed spikerush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Moquinia orbiculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality.</p>
