<p>Mesembryanthemum thunbergii, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum thunbergii is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a ground cover in arid environments.</p>
