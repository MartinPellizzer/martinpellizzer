                    <h1>Maianthemum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Maianthemum × intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false shamrock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Maianthemum dasycarpum and Maianthemum montanum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive appearance featuring clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically has broad, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
