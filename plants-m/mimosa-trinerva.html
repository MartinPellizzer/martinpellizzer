<p>Mimosa trinerva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Mimosa trinerva is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment.</p>
