<p>Milium effusum subsp.</p>
<p>cisatlanticum, commonly known as the eastern swamp millet, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
