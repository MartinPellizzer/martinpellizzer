<p>Macrostylis galipanensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a prominent central column. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
