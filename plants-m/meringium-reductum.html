                    <h1>Meringium reductum</h1>
<p>Meringium reductum, commonly known as the reduced meringia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive size and delicate, pale lavender petals that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, glossy leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Meringium reductum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
