                    <h1>Muscaria muscoides</h1>
<p>Muscaria muscoides, commonly known as the common fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a distinctive reddish-brown cap with white spots and a bulbous base that is often covered in a volva. The fruiting bodies typically grow in mixed forests, particularly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The spores are released from a volva-like structure at the base of the stem, and the mushroom is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of ibotenic acid and muscimol.</p>
<p>However, it is considered toxic and should not be consumed.</p>
