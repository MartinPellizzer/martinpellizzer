                    <h1>Mucuna lamellata</h1>
<p>Mucuna lamellata, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits. The plant produces a significant amount of seed, which is often used as a source of protein and in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>However, it can also be invasive and toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
