<p>Microlepia hirsuta var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the hirsute sword fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant features fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged along the margins of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
