<p>Melocactus zehntneri subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the white-haired melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its growth is slow and it is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic and resilience.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to other melocactus species but is distinguished by its specific hair structure and geographic distribution.</p>
