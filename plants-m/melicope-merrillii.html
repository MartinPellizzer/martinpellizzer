<p>Melicope merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Melicope merrillii is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
