<p>Myriopteris marsupianthes var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are usually less than 15 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Myriopteris marsupianthes.</p>
