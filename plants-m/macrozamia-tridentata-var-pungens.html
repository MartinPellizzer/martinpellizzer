<p>Macrozamia tridentata var. pungens, commonly known as the Pungent Macrozamia, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia.</p>

The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often spiny and have a distinct, pungent scent, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>
