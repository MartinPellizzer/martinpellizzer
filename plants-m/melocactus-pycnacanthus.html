                    <h1>Melocactus pycnacanthus</h1>
<p>Melocactus pycnacanthus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often develops a red or purple hue, especially under sunlight. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection while also contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Melocactus pycnacanthus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick stem and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
