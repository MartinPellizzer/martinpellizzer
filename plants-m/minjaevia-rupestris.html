<p>Minjaevia rupestris, commonly known as the rock minjaevia, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
