<p>Malaxis affinis, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Malaxis affinis is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
