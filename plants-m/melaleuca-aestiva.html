                    <h1>Melaleuca aestiva</h1>
<p>Melaleuca aestiva, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in sandy soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Melaleuca aestiva is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient plant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
