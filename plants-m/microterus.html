<p>Microterus, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a genus of small, tropical ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically have delicate, lace-like fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. They thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.
