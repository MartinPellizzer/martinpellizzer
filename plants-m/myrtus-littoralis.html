<p>Myrtus littoralis, commonly known as coastal myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows along coastal areas and rocky shores, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Myrtus littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
