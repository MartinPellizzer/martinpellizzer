                    <h1>Morelosia montana</h1>
<p>Morelosia montana, commonly known as the mountain morelosia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where humidity is high. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Morelosia montana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
