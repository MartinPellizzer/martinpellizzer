                    <h1>Mimosa foetida</h1>
<p>Mimosa foetida, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, pod-like fruits. Its leaves and stems emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter animals.</p>
<p>Mimosa foetida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
