                <h1>Medica hirsuta</h1>
<p>Medica hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy medick, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Medica hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
