<p>Mystacidium xanthopollinium, commonly known as the golden pollen moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces male and female reproductive structures on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Its spores are released in a unique, sticky pollen-like substance, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
