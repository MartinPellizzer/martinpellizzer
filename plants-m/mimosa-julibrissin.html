<p>Mimosa julibrissin, commonly known as the silk tree or velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical stimuli. The plant produces fragrant, fluffy pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by distinctive, woody pods that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it can grow up to 20 feet tall in ideal conditions.</p>
<p>Mimosa julibrissin is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
