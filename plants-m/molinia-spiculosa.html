                    <h1>Molinia spiculosa</h1>
<p>Molinia spiculosa, commonly known as the slender moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, moist environments such as bogs, fens, and heaths, where it forms dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Molinia spiculosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
