                <h1>Mimosa adenocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa adenocarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light and touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Mimosa adenocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and rapid growth habit.</p>
