<p>Miconia leaechinata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
