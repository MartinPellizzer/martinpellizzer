                    <h1>Miconia conobracteata</h1>
<p>Miconia conobracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
