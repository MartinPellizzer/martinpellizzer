                    <h1>Microchilus fosbergii</h1>
<p>Microchilus fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Roccellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically found on bark and stone in moist, shaded environments. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species within its ecological niche.</p>
