                    <h1>Metastelma salinarum</h1>
<p>Metastelma salinarum, commonly known as the salt marsh mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host, typically a mangrove tree, through a specialized root system called a haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are succulent, helping it retain moisture in saline and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Metastelma salinarum plays a role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
