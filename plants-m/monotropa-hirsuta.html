                    <h1>Monotropa hirsuta</h1>
<p>Monotropa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in the understory of temperate forests, typically growing on the roots of trees such as hemlock and fir. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions without photosynthesis.</p>
