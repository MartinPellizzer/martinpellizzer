<p>Macrozamia preissii subsp.</p>
<p>dyeri, commonly known as the Queensland cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its cones are distinctive with a spiny, fibrous outer layer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
