<p>Melaleuca pilosa var. lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or greyish inner layer. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
