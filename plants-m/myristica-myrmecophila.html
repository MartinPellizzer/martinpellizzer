<p>Myristica myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hollow stems that provide shelter for ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the hollow structures and protect the plant from herbivores. Myristica myrmecophila also produces fragrant, yellowish flowers and develops distinctive fruit capsules.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant-animal interactions in tropical ecosystems.</p>
