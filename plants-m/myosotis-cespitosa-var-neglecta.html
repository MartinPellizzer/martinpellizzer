                    <h1>Myosotis cespitosa var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Myosotis cespitosa var. neglecta, commonly known as the clustered forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground with a carpet of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its clustered growth habit and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
