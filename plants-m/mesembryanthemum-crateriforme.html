<p>Mesembryanthemum crateriforme, commonly known as the star-shaped ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum crateriforme is well adapted to rocky, coastal, and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
