<p>Myristica inutilis f. nanophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf nutmeg.</p>
<p>It is a rare botanical variant of the nutmeg tree, characterized by its diminutive leaves and reduced floral structures. This form exhibits unique morphological traits that distinguish it from the typical nutmeg species. The plant belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in understanding the evolution of nutmeg species.</p>
