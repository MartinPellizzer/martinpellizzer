                    <h1>Manihot orinocensis</h1>
<p>Manihot orinocensis, commonly known as Orinoco manioc, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces a starchy root known as cassava, which is a staple food in many regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and versatility in cooking.</p>
<p>However, its roots contain cyanogenic glycosides, requiring proper processing to remove toxic compounds before consumption.</p>
