<p>Mammillaria bicolor var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate mammillaria, is a unique cactus species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive "cristate" growth form, which results in a fan-like, flattened appearance due to the elongation of its stems. The plant features pale green to white spines and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
