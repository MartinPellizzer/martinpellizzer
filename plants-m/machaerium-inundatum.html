<p>Machaerium inundatum, commonly known as water machaerium, is a tropical perennial grass native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
