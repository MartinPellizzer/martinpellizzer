<p>Melica popoviciana, commonly known as Popov's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grasses.</p>
<p>Melica popoviciana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
