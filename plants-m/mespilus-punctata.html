                    <h1>Mespilus punctata</h1>
<p>Mespilus punctata, commonly known as the spotted medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, spiny bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are often inedible until they undergo a process called "bleeding," where they soften and release a sweet, aromatic pulp. Mespilus punctata is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its seasonal changes in foliage and fruiting habits.</p>
