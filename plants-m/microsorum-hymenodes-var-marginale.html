<p>Microsorum hymenodes var. marginale, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a delicate and elegant aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue along the margins. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>It is popular in water gardens and aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life.</p>
