                            <h1>Mirabilis Froebelii Var. Glabrata</h1>
<p>Froebel's four o'clock, scientifically known as Mirabilis froebelii var. glabrata, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is named for its unique blooming habit, which occurs primarily in the late afternoon, resembling the time when a clock strikes four. The plant is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn, adding a magical touch to the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this beautiful and ecologically significant plant for future generations.</p>
