<p>Montia fontana, commonly known as the water chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems that are often prostrate and covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Montia fontana is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp environments where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
