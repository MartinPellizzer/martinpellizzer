                    <h1>Mystacidium caffrum</h1>
<p>Mystacidium caffrum, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Mystacidium caffrum is often found in woodland and forested areas, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
