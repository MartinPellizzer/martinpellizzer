                    <h1>Melocactus holguinensis</h1>
<p>Melocactus holguinensis, commonly known as the Holgu√≠n cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stem that often remains below ground, with a few tall, cylindrical stems emerging above the soil. The plant produces striking, bright red flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
