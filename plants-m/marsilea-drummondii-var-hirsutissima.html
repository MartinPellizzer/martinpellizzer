                    <h1>Marsilea drummondii var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Marsilea drummondii var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves helps it retain moisture and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
