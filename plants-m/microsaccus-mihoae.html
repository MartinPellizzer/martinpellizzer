<p>Microsaccus mihoae, commonly known as the Mihoae bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Microsaccus mihoae is notable for its specialized adaptations for carnivorous and photosynthetic survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
