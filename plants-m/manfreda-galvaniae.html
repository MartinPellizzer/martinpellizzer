                    <h1>Manfreda galvaniae</h1>
<p>Manfreda galvaniae, commonly known as the Galvania manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Phytolacaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the spring or early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Manfreda galvaniae is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
