                    <h1>Molinia caerulea var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical Molinia caerulea. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
