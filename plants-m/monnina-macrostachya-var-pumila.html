                    <h1>Monnina macrostachya var. pumila</h1>
<p>Monnina macrostachya var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf prostrate monkeyflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
