                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
