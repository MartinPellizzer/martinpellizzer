<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique floating structure on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves support a diverse ecosystem of insects and small aquatic life.</p>
