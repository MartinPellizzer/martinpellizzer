<p>Mystacidium laurentii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for water and nutrients. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
