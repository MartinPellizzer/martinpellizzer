                    <h1>Metasequoia neopangaea</h1>
<p>Metasequoia neopangaea, commonly known as the dawn redwood, is an extinct species of conifer that once thrived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves, which were adapted for efficient photosynthesis in a warm, moist climate. The plant produced cone-bearing structures, typical of gymnosperms, and its wood was likely valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Fossil evidence suggests that it was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions that are now part of China, North America, and Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its extinction, it is no longer found in the wild, though it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and research institutions for study.</p>
