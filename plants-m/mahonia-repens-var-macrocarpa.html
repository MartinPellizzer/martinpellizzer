                    <h1>Mahonia repens var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Mahonia repens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited mahonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It features holly-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by large, showy blue-black berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and persistent fruit, which provide seasonal interest.</p>
