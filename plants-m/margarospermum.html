                    <h1>Margarospermum</h1>
<p>Margarospermum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique structure with a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and often appear in clusters, resembling ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Margarospermum is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by conservationists.</p>
