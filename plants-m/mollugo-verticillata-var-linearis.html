                    <h1>Mollugo verticillata var. linearis</h1>
<p>Mollugo verticillata var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical varietal form of Mollugo verticillata.</p>
