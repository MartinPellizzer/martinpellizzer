<p>Manniophyton fulvum, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a unique halophyte that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in coastal areas. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Manniophyton fulvum plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
