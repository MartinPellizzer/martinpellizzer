                    <h1>Miconia erikmaniana</h1>
<p>Miconia erikmaniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
