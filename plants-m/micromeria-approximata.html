<p>Micromeria approximata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Micromeria approximata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
