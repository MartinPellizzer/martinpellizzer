                    <h1>Miconia tovarensis</h1>
<p>Miconia tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovar Island miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tovar in the Gal√°pagos Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Miconia tovarensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
