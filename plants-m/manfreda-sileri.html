<p>Manfreda sileri, commonly known as the silverleaf manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
