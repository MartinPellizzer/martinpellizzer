                    <h1>Mammillaria carnea var. cirrosa</h1>
<p>Mammillaria carnea var. cirrosa, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering that covers the entire plant, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The stems are typically cylindrical and often branch out to form a small, rounded clump. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or pink, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil.</p>
