                    <h1>Mikania glandulifera</h1>
<p>Mikania glandulifera, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Mikania glandulifera is also known for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional medicine and for making ropes and textiles.</p>
