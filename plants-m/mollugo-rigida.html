<p>Mollugo rigida, commonly known as rigid sandpenny, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy soils in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mollugo rigida is well adapted to coastal and dune habitats, thriving in salty and well-drained conditions.</p>
