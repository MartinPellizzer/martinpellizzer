                    <h1>Masdevallia belua</h1>
<p>Masdevallia belua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, often pale or translucent leaves and its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth rather than soil. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are highly fragrant and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Masdevallia belua is considered a conservation concern.</p>
