                    <h1>Melampyrum debreceniense</h1>
<p>Melampyrum debreceniense, commonly known as the Hungarian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its geographic origin, as it is native to regions in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
