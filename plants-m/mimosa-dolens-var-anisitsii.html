<p>Mimosa dolens var. anisitsii, commonly known as the Anisitsii Mimosa, is a variant of the Mimosa plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed, a trait typical of the Mimosa genus.</p>
