<p>Medica pourretii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Medica pourretii is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
