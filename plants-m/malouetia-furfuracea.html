                    <h1>Malouetia furfuracea</h1>
<p>Malouetia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
