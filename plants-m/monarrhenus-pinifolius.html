                    <h1>Monarrhenus pinifolius</h1>
<p>Monarrhenus pinifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are needle-like, reducing water loss through transpiration, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
