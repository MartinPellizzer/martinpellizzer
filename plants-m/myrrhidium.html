<p>Myrrhidium, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, candle-like spikes of tubular, showy flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green in color.

<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
