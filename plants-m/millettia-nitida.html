                    <h1>Millettia nitida</h1>
<p>Millettia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage composed of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in landscaping and as a shade tree in warmer climates.</p>
