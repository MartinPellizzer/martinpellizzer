<p>Marsilea condensata, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being oval and slightly overlapping. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It is often found in muddy or sandy substrates in ponds, lakes, and ditches.</p>
<p>Marsilea condensata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
