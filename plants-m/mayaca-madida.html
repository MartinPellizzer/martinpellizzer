<p>Mayaca madida, commonly known as the Brazilian water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters and wetlands, often forming dense mats on the water surface. The plant has long, flexible stems that float on the water, with small, narrow leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically yellow or greenish in color, and it produces small, oval fruits.</p>
<p>Mayaca madida plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
