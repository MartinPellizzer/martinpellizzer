                    <h1>Melocactus macrocephalus</h1>
<p>Melocactus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection while allowing for some airflow around the stem.</p>
<p>The cactus is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate to conserve resources.</p>
