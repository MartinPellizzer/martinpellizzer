<p>Mesembryanthemum deflexum, commonly known as the drooping ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
