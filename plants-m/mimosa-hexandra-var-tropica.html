<p>Mimosa hexandra var. tropica, commonly known as the tropical mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
