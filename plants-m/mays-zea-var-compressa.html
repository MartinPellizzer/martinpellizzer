                    <h1>Mays zea var. compressa</h1>
<p>Mays zea var. compressa, commonly known as the compressed maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its compact growth habit and unique morphological features.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a shorter stature compared to typical maize, with tightly packed leaves and a more restricted inflorescence. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications. The compressed form may offer advantages in space efficiency and resilience to environmental stressors.</p>
<p>It is often studied for its role in plant genetics and breeding programs.</p>
