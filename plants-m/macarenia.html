                    <h1>Macarenia</h1>
<p>Macarenia, commonly known as the "Pineapple Plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, hence its common name. Macarenia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant foliage and unique floral structures.</p>
<p>They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
