                    <h1>Metroxylon sagu f. longispinum</h1>
<p>Metroxylon sagu f. longispinum, commonly known as the longispinous sago palm, is a variant of the sago palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the trunk, which eventually develop into fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots contain starch, which is traditionally harvested for food and industrial uses.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique spiny structures on the leaves, distinguishing it from other sago palm species.</p>
