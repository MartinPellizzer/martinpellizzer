                    <h1>Manihot tweedieana var. lobata</h1>
<p>Manihot tweedieana var. lobata, commonly known as the swamp arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that produces starchy tubers, which are historically used as a food source. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy environments, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Manihot species, which are known for their economic and nutritional value.</p>
