                    <h1>Miconia erostrata</h1>
<p>Miconia erostrata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, bright red fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Miconia erostrata is also notable for its ornamental value, though its ecological impact can be significant.</p>
