<p>Melaleuca vinnula, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Melaleuca vinnula is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
