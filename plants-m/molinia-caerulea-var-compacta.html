                    <h1>Molinia caerulea var. compacta</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea var. compacta, commonly known as dwarf moorgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to whitish flowers in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in garden settings, particularly in wetland or bog gardens.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
