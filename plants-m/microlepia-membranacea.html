<p>Microlepia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, round sporangia clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
