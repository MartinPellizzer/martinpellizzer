                    <h1>Mycelis angulosa</h1>
<p>Mycelis angulosa, commonly known as the angular mycelium, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, angular growth pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Mycetozoaceae and is known for its ability to form complex, branching structures. The plant's morphology is defined by its sharp, angular nodes and elongated stems that often appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rare occurrence and specialized habitat, Mycelis angulosa is of interest to botanists studying fungal-plant interactions.</p>
