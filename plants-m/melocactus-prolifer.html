                    <h1>Melocactus prolifer</h1>
<p>Melocactus prolifer, commonly known as the fissurated melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its growth is slow, and it often forms clumps through a process called basal offsets, which contribute to its unique, clustered shape.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
