                    <h1>Metastelma sepium</h1>
<p>Metastelma sepium, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
