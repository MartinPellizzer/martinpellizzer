                    <h1>Macrozamia riedlei</h1>
<p>Macrozamia riedlei, commonly known as the Riedl's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
