                    <h1>Miegia</h1>
<p>Miegia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble the color of moonlight. The plant has a delicate, aromatic scent that is said to be most noticeable at night. Miegia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring only once every few years, making it a rare and sought-after botanical specimen.</p>
