<p>Melica diffusa, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with green or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Melica diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
