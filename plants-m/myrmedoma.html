                    <h1>Myrmedoma</h1>
<p>Myrmedoma, commonly known as the "ant plant," is a unique tropical plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a hollow stem with specialized chambers that provide shelter and food for the resident ant colonies. The plant secretes nectar through glandular structures, which the ants cultivate and protect in return. This mutualistic relationship helps the plant defend against herbivores and promotes its growth.</p>
<p>Myrmedoma is native to regions in South America and is a fascinating example of plant-ant co-evolution.</p>
