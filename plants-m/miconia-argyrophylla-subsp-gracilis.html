<p>Miconia argyrophylla subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as silverleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced.</p>
