                    <h1>Mahernia marginata</h1>
<p>Mahernia marginata, commonly known as the marginated mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. Mahernia marginata is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
