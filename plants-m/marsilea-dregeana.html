                    <h1>Marsilea dregeana</h1>
<p>Marsilea dregeana, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks above the water. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Marsilea dregeana is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to help control algae growth.</p>
