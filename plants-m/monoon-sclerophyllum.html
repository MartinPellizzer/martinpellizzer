                    <h1>Monoon sclerophyllum</h1>
<p>Monoon sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved monoon, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green and leathery in texture, an adaptation to its often dry and sunny habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
