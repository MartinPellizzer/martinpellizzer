<p>Melica debilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a delicate annual grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 10 cm in length. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Melica debilis is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as an indicator of wet or mesic conditions in ecological studies.</p>
