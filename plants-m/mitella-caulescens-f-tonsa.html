The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
