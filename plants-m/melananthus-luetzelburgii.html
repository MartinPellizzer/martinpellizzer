                    <h1>Melananthus luetzelburgii</h1>
<p>Melananthus luetzelburgii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and extensive root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays a significant ecological role in its native environment.</p>
