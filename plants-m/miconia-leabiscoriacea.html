<p>Miconia leabiscoriacea, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
