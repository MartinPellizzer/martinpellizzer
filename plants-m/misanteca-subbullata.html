                    <h1>Misanteca subbullata</h1>
<p>Misanteca subbullata, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Misanteca subbullata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both the host trees and the local wildlife.</p>
