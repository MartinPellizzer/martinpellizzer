                    <h1>Mikania rotunda</h1>
<p>Mikania rotunda, commonly known as the globeflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Mikania rotunda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
