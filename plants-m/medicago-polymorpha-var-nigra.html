<p>Medicago polymorpha var. nigra, commonly known as black medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Black medick is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings.</p>
