                    <h1>Myrmecodia longifolia</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia longifolia, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It forms a specialized structure called a domatium, which provides shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant's leaves are opposite and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia longifolia is often found growing on trees in humid tropical environments.</p>
