<p>Melocactus pescaderensis, commonly known as the Pescaderensis melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a cluster of large, rounded, ribbed fruits that resemble melons, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the dry season, which are pollinated by insects. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
