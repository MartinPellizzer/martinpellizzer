<p>Mabea piriri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Mabea piriri is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, making it a common understory species in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
