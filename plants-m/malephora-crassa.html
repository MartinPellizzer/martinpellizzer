                    <h1>Malephora crassa</h1>
<p>Malephora crassa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is also considered endangered.</p>
