<p>Marattia stanleyana, commonly known as Stanley's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of many primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Marattia stanleyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
