                    <h1>Marsilea tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Marsilea tenuifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being narrow and delicate. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Marsilea tenuifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
