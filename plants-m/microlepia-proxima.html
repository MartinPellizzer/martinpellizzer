<p>Microlepia proxima, commonly known as the common microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Microlepia proxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
