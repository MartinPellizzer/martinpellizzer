<p>Margaritaria cyanosperma, commonly known as the blue-green mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in tidal wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations to saline conditions contribute to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
