                    <h1>Mentha pulegium var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium var. vulgaris, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its highly aromatic, square stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorls, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pennyroyal is known for its strong menthol-like scent and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
