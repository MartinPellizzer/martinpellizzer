                    <h1>Mimosa canonis</h1>
<p>Mimosa canonis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically upright, reaching heights of up to 2 feet, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa canonis is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
