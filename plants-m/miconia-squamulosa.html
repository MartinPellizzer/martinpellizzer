                    <h1>Miconia squamulosa</h1>
<p>Miconia squamulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red fruits containing numerous seeds. Miconia squamulosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of tropical plant ecology and plant invasions.</p>
