<p>Melastoma lacerum, commonly known as the broken-leaf melastoma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, five-lobed petals that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the undergrowth.</p>
