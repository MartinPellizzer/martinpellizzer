                    <h1>Middletonia regularis</h1>
<p>Middletonia regularis, commonly known as the regular middletonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Middletonia regularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
