<p>Melaleuca pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy texture, and are arranged in whorls around the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca pyramidalis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
