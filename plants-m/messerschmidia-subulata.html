                    <h1>Messerschmidia subulata</h1>
<p>Messerschmidia subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaved sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tiny, needle-like leaves that are tightly clustered, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptations make it well-suited for survival in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions.</p>
