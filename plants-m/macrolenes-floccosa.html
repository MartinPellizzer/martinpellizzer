                    <h1>Macrolenes floccosa</h1>
<p>Macrolenes floccosa, commonly known as the cloud-like fern, is a unique plant characterized by its soft, feathery fronds that resemble clouds.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's leaves are composed of numerous tiny, overlapping pinnae, giving it a fluffy appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in greenhouses to maintain optimal growing conditions.</p>
