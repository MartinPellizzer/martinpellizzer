                    <h1>Mouroucoa imbricata</h1>
<p>Mouroucoa imbricata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits in appearance, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid environment.</p>
<p>Mouroucoa imbricata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
