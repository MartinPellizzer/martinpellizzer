<p>Megalastrum fugaceum, commonly known as the fleeting starflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Megalastrum fugaceum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
