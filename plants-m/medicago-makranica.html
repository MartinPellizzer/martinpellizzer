                    <h1>Medicago makranica</h1>
<p>Medicago makranica, commonly known as Makran clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Medicago makranica is also valued for its potential in forage and ecological restoration in semi-arid landscapes.</p>
