<p>Marsilea elata var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, each with a prominent horn-like protrusion at the tip. This variety thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it anchors itself with its rhizomes. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, spherical fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and aquatic habitat make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
