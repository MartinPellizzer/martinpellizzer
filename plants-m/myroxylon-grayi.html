<p>Myroxylon grayi, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
