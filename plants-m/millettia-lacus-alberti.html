                    <h1>Millettia lacus-alberti</h1>
<p>Millettia lacus-alberti, commonly known as Albert's lacustrine millettia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. Native to specific regions in Africa, this plant thrives in moist, tropical or subtropical environments. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, a common feature among legumes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity and ecological adaptation.</p>
