                    <h1>Minuartia palyzanica</h1>
<p>Minuartia palyzanica, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Minuartia palyzanica is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils where few other plants can survive.</p>
