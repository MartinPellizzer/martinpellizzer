<p>Melaleuca fissurata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and they are arranged alternately along the branches.</p>
<p>Melaleuca fissurata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
