                    <h1>Mimosa gratissima</h1>
<p>Mimosa gratissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Mimosa gratissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid movement.</p>
