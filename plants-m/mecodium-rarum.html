                    <h1>Mecodium rarum</h1>
<p>Mecodium rarum, commonly known as the rare meadow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mecodium rarum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
