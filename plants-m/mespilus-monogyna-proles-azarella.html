                    <h1>Mespilus monogyna proles azarella</h1>
<p>Mespilus monogyna proles azarella, commonly known as the Azarilla persimmon, is a rare and specialized variant of the common medlar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes both staminate and pistillate flowers on the same plant, making it monoecious. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in the fall, with a flavor reminiscent of both persimmon and fig. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural research.</p>
