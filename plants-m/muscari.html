                    <h1>Muscari</h1>
<p>Muscari, commonly known as grape hyacinth, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence their common name. Muscari species are native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and they thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. They are often used in gardens for their early spring blooms and their ability to naturalize over time.</p>
<p>The bulbs of muscari are toxic if ingested, so caution is advised when handling them.</p>
