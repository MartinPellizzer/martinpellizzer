<p>Microlepia szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan microlepia, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
