                    <h1>Mimosa bracaatinga var. aspericarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa bracaatinga var. aspericarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically oval and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The species is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
