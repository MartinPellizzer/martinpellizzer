                    <h1>Myroxylon rhombifolium</h1>
<p>Myroxylon rhombifolium, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged along the branches. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into woody capsules containing aromatic resinous sap. This sap, known as copaiba balm, is highly valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant due to its resin yield.</p>
