                    <h1>Mortonia</h1>
<p>Mortonia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species found in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and stems that appear to glow faintly in low light. The plant contains a toxic alkaloid called mortonine, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Mortonia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources.</p>
<p>Its unusual appearance and chemical composition make it both fascinating and dangerous to handle.</p>
