                    <h1>Mikania paniculata</h1>
<p>Mikania paniculata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along the ground, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and stems allow it to spread easily, often forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
