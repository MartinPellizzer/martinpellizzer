                    <h1>Mimetes integer</h1>
<p>Mimetes integer, commonly known as the mountain zamioculcas, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, which includes cycads.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its stiff, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
