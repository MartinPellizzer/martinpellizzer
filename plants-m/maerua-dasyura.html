<p>Maerua dasyura, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources.</p>
<p>Maerua dasyura is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
