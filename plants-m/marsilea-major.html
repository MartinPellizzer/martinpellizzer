                    <h1>Marsilea major</h1>
<p>Marsilea major, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Marsilea major plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
