<p>Minuartia setacea subsp.</p>
<p>subsetacea, commonly known as the mossy rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in racemes. It is adapted to harsh environments, such as alpine and arctic regions, where it can withstand cold temperatures and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, resilient vegetation.</p>
