<p>Meconopsis baileyi subsp.</p>
<p>pratensis, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
