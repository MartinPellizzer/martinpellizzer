<p>Marcgravia tobagensis, commonly known as the Toba mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as figs and palms, through haustoria to derive some of its nutrients. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds with a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>Marcgravia tobagensis plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
