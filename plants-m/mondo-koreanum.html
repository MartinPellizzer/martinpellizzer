                    <h1>Mondo koreanum</h1>
<p>Mondo koreanum, commonly known as the Korean mondo grass, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to Korea.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like ground cover. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas.</p>
