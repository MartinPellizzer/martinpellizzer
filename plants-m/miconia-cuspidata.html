                    <h1>Miconia cuspidata</h1>
<p>Miconia cuspidata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into orange-red berries. It is often found in wet tropical forests and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
