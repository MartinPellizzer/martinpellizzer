<p>Microlepia villosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microlepia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
