                    <h1>Mariscus infucatus</h1>
<p>Mariscus infucatus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Mariscus infucatus is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
