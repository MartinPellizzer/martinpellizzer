                    <h1>Mollugo pluckenetiana</h1>
<p>Mollugo pluckenetiana, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are encased in a bladder-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
