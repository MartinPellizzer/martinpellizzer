                    <h1>Mimosa flagellaris</h1>
<p>Mimosa flagellaris, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as gardens and fields.</p>
<p>Mimosa flagellaris is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
