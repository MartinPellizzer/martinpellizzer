<p>Marattia laxa, commonly known as the slender moon-leaf, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across forest floors in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically green with a slightly curled appearance, and they produce spores on the underside of the pinnae.</p>
<p>Marattia laxa is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings.</p>
