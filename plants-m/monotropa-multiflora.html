                    <h1>Monotropa multiflora</h1>
<p>Monotropa multiflora, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is often found in shaded, moist forest floors, particularly in temperate regions of North America. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Despite its ghostly appearance, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting fungal networks.</p>
