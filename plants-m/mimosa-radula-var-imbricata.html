<p>Mimosa radula var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
