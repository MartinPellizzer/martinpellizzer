                    <h1>Magnolia lacandonica</h1>
<p>Magnolia lacandonica, commonly known as the Lacandon magnolia, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its broad, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its bark is smooth and light gray in color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for the survival of this unique botanical species.</p>
