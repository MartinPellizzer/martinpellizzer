<p>Miconia rugosa, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia rugosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact.</p>
