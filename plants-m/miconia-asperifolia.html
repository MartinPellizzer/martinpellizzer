                    <h1>Miconia asperifolia</h1>
<p>Miconia asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Miconia asperifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
