                    <h1>Microchilus hylibates</h1>
<p>Microchilus hylibates, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a role in the unique ecological balance of Hawaiian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
