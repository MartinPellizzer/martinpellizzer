<p>Myosotis spinocarpos, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant has specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow, muddy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
