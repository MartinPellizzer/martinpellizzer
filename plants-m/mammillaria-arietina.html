<p>Mammillaria arietina, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features prominent tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps that give it a textured appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mammillaria arietina is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or containers, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
