                    <h1>Megadenia speluncarum</h1>
<p>Megadenia speluncarum, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the limestone caves of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic fern that thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for partial illumination. Its fronds are typically small and delicate, adapted to the low-light conditions of its subterranean habitat. The plant's unique morphology includes thick, moisture-retaining rhizomes that help it survive in nutrient-poor cave soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, Megadenia speluncarum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and human disturbance.</p>
