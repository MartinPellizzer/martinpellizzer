                    <h1>Monotropa uniflora var. pentapetala</h1>
<p>Monotropa uniflora var. pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled ghost plant, is a unique species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often clustered in groups of three to five. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy, translucent appearance.</p>
<p>This rare variant is distinguished by its five-petaled flowers, which are more elaborate than those of the typical Monotropa uniflora.</p>
