<p>Melochia arida, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
<p>Melochia arida is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
