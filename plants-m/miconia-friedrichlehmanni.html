<p>Miconia friedrichlehmanni, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest leaf plants in the world. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
