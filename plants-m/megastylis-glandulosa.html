                    <h1>Megastylis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Megastylis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval, and covered with a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, sticky glandular structure on the petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
