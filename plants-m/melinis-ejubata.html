<p>Melinis ejubata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sicklegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
