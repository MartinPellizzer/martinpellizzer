<p>Musa simiarum var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild banana, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, broad leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, green, finger-like fruits that are typically not edible due to high levels of toxins. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with cultivated bananas.</p>
