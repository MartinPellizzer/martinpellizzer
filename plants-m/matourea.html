                    <h1>Matourea</h1>
<p>Matourea, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant and supports its heavy foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Matourea plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
