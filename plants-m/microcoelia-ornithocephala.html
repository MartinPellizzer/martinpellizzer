                    <h1>Microcoelia ornithocephala</h1>
<p>Microcoelia ornithocephala, commonly known as the bird-headed lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly adherent growth on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive, bird-like head-shaped apothecium. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rock crevices and soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to lichenologists and conservationists.</p>
