                    <h1>Mimosa trijuga</h1>
<p>Mimosa trijuga, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa trijuga is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also studied for its unique physiological responses.</p>
