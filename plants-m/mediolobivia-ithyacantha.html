<p>It features striking, star-shaped white petals that emit a subtle fragrance, particularly at dusk. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
