<p>Melampyrum hoermannianum, commonly known as Hoermann's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it is often found in areas with rich, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
