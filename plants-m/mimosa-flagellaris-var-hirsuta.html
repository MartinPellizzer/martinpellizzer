                    <h1>Mimosa flagellaris var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Mimosa flagellaris var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy trichomes, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
