<p>Maireana appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spinifex, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
