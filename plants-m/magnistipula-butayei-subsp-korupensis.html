<p>Magnistipula butayei subsp.</p>
<p>korupensis, commonly known as the Korup mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
