<p>Monachosorum davallioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces. The plant features intricate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green or almost translucent, giving it its ethereal appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
