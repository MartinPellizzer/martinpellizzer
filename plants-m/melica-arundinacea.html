                    <h1>Melica arundinacea</h1>
<p>Melica arundinacea, commonly known as bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
