<p>Microsorum longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>Microsorum longissimum is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
