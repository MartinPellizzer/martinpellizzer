                    <h1>Mimosa rupertiana</h1>
<p>Mimosa rupertiana, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mimosa rupertiana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
