                    <h1>Mimosa pigra var. hispida</h1>
<p>Mimosa pigra var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
