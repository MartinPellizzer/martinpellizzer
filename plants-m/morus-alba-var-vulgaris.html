                    <h1>Morus alba var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Morus alba var. vulgaris, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia but widely cultivated in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically pale green with a fuzzy texture. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are rich in nutrients and historically used in silk production. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often marked with horizontal lenticels.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for silkworms and supporting biodiversity in gardens and landscapes.</p>
