                    <h1>Moquilea elata</h1>
<p>Moquilea elata, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Moquilea elata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
