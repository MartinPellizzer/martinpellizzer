                    <h1>Manulea dubia</h1>
<p>Manulea dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pale green or white stems and its delicate, showy flowers that resemble those of other orchid genera. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic, relying on air, rain, and decaying organic matter for nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Manulea dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
