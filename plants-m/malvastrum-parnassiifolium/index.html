                            <h1>Malvastrum Parnassiifolium</h1>
<p>Parnassian mallow, scientifically known as Malvastrum parnassiifolium, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This species is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Despite its ornamental appeal, the plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is increasingly threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
