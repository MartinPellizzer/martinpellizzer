                    <h1>Monocyclis</h1>
<p>Monocyclis, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Monocyclis species typically have a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's cones. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.</p>
