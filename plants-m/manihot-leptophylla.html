                    <h1>Manihot leptophylla</h1>
<p>Manihot leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source, similar to other manioc species.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other arrowroot varieties due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
