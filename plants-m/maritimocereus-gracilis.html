<p>Maritimocereus gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Maritimocereus gracilis is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
