                    <h1>Microlepia micangshanensis</h1>
<p>Microlepia micangshanensis, commonly known as the Micangshan sword fern, is a rare and endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives on rocky or forested substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
