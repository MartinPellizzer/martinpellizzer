                    <h1>Macrohystrix komarovii</h1>
<p>Macrohystrix komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to subtropical and tropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
