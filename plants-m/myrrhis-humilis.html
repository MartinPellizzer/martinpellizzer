                    <h1>Myrrhis humilis</h1>
<p>Myrrhis humilis, commonly known as lesser hogweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can reach considerable depths, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Myrrhis humilis is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in damp meadows.</p>
