                    <h1>Melica arrecta</h1>
<p>Melica arrecta, commonly known as stiff brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Melica arrecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
