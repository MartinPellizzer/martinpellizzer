                    <h1>Mammariella</h1>
<p>Mammariella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once a year, making it a striking yet elusive species. Mammariella is typically found in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and bogs.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
