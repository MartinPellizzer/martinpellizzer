<p>Maclura tinctoria var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited pokeweed, is a variant of the pokeweed species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its thick, rough bark and alternate, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by green, fleshy berries that mature to a yellowish-orange color. Its leaves and berries contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though with caution.</p>
