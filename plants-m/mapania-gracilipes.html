<p>Mapania gracilipes, commonly known as the slender mapania, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
