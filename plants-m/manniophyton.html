                    <h1>Manniophyton</h1>
<p>Manniophyton, commonly known as the African water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, seed-like propagules that allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Manniophyton plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
