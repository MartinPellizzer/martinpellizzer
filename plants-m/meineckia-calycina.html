                    <h1>Meineckia calycina</h1>
<p>Meineckia calycina, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in wet, swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in association with mangroves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
