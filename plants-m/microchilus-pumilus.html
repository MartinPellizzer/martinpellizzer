                    <h1>Microchilus pumilus</h1>
<p>Microchilus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits coniferous forests.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host tree for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that can be detrimental to the host's health. The plant produces small, white or pink berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. Its roots penetrate the host's stem, establishing a connection for nutrient transfer.</p>
<p>Microchilus pumilus is typically found in temperate regions and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form.</p>
