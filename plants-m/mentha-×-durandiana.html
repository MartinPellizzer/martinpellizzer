<p>Mentha × durandiana, commonly known as the peppermint plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridis (watermint).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, highly fragrant leaves that contain high concentrations of menthol and other essential oils. The plant is a perennial herb with square, erect stems and opposite, serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its essential oils used in aromatherapy, medicine, and flavoring.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments.</p>
