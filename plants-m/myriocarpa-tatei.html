<p>Myriocarpa tatei, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
