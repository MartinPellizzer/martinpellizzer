                    <h1>Mimosa terribilis</h1>
<p>Mimosa terribilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or the mimic plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners, it is often considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
