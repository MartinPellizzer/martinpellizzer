                    <h1>Melampyrum roseum f. leucanthum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum roseum f. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered betony, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common betony.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique coloration and its role in supporting pollinators in its native environment.</p>
