<p>Mimosa habbas, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa habbas is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive floral display.</p>
