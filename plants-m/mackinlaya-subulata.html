                    <h1>Mackinlaya subulata</h1>
<p>Mackinlaya subulata, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist heat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Mackinlaya subulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
