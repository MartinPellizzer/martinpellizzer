                    <h1>Metathelypteris uraiensis var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Metathelypteris uraiensis var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Metathelypteris.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, arching growth habit. Its sori are clustered along the margins of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
