<p>Mentha arvensis f. puberula, commonly known as narrow-leaf field mint, is a variant of the broad-leaf field mint.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The essential oils of this variety are similar to those of its parent species, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
