                    <h1>Mammillaria dioica var. insularis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria dioica var. insularis, commonly known as the Insular Mammillaria, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a globular to cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent areolas. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
