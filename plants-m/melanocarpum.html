                    <h1>Melanocarpum</h1>
<p>Melanocarpum, commonly known as the blackfooted mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their dark, often velvety caps and stems, which are typically covered in a fine, sticky layer. They are predominantly found in temperate regions, often growing in association with decaying wood or leaf litter. Melanocarpum species are saprophytic, playing a vital role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological function make them an important subject in mycological studies.</p>
