<p>Matricaria inodora subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple composite flowers and silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and is resistant to salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
