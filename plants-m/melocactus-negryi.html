                    <h1>Melocactus negryi</h1>
<p>Melocactus negryi, commonly known as the Negry's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from both herbivores and extreme sunlight. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, melon-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a notable species in the Cactaceae family.</p>
