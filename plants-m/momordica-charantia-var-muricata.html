                    <h1>Momordica charantia var. muricata</h1>
<p>Momordica charantia var. muricata, commonly known as bitter melon, is a tropical vine characterized by its distinctive, ridged, and spiny fruits.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, though it is now cultivated in various warm climates worldwide. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, while the stems are hairy and trailing. The fruit, which is typically harvested when immature, has a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids and other compounds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional medicine for its potential hypoglycemic properties.</p>
