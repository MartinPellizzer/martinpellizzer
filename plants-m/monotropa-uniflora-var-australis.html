                    <h1>Monotropa uniflora var. australis</h1>
<p>Monotropa uniflora var. australis, commonly known as the Australian ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale green, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This species is often found in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
