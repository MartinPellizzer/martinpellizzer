<p>Miscolobium spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of coniferous trees, such as firs and spruces, in temperate regions. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with small white or greenish petals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
