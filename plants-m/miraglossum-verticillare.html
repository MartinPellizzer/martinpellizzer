                    <h1>Miraglossum verticillare</h1>
<p>Miraglossum verticillare, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a small, delicate moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly spiraled stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its growth form allows it to efficiently retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in such habitats.</p>
<p>Miraglossum verticillare plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other small organisms.</p>
