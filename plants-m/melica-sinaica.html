<p>Melica sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Melica sinaica plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
