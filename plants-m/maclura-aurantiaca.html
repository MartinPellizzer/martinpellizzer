                    <h1>Maclura aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Maclura aurantiaca, commonly known as the yellow wood or American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The wood is hard and durable, historically used for tool handles and furniture.</p>
