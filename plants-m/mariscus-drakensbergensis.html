<p>Mariscus drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg mariscus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Drakensberg mountain range of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellow, bloom in late spring and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus drakensbergensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
