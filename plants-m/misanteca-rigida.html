<p>Misanteca rigida, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host plant. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Misanteca rigida is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
