                    <h1>Mimosa foliolosa var. strigosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa foliolosa var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into small, hairy leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptive responses make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
