<p>Minuartia litorea, commonly known as the sea saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions through its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
