                            <h1>Mirabilis Cervantesii</h1>
<p>Cervantes' four-o'clock, scientifically known as Mirabilis cervantesii, is a rare and captivating flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. This unique species belongs to the Nyctaginaceae family, which is known for its striking evening-blooming flowers. Despite its name, the plant does not open its petals at exactly four o'clock but rather in the late afternoon or early evening. Its delicate, tubular flowers come in shades of pink, purple, and white, adding a touch of elegance to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cervantes' four-o'clock is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
