                    <h1>Mammea calciphila</h1>
<p>Mammea calciphila, commonly known as the limestone mammea, is a rare shrub native to the limestone hills of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
