<p>Mascagnia lucida subsp.</p>
<p>lucida, commonly known as the shining mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to photosynthesize, though it also derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots.</p>
