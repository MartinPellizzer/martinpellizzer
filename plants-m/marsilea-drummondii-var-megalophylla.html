                    <h1>Marsilea drummondii var. megalophylla</h1>
<p>Marsilea drummondii var. megalophylla, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like structure.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are deeply divided into four oval-shaped lobes, which help it to absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on slender stems, followed by dark brown, floating fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
