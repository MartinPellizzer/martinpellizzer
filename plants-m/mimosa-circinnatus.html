                    <h1>Mimosa circinnatus</h1>
<p>Mimosa circinnatus, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Mimosa circinnatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
