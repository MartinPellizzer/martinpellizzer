<p>Myriocephalus oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfieldâ€™s ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with a single, elongated flower that resembles a spectral figure. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flower is composed of three sepals and three petals, with a distinctive hood-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
