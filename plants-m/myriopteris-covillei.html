                    <h1>Myriopteris covillei</h1>
<p>Myriopteris covillei, commonly known as Coville's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
