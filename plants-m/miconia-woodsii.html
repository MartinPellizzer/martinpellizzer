<p>Miconia woodsii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests, often forming dense thickets. It has smooth, dark green foliage and produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions of Hawaii.</p>
