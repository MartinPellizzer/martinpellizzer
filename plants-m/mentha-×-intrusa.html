<p>Mentha × intrusa, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Mentha longifolia (spearmint) and Mentha × piperita (peppermint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a dense, woolly texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
