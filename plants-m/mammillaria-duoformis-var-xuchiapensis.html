                    <h1>Mammillaria duoformis var. xuchiapensis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria duoformis var. xuchiapensis, commonly known as the Xuchiapense mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a white, woolly coating that helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries.</p>
