<p>Microlicia scoparia, commonly known as the desert thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
<p>Microlicia scoparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for small animals in its native habitat.</p>
