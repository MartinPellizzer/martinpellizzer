                    <h1>Miconia tetragona</h1>
<p>Miconia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
