<p>Melinis repens subsp.</p>
<p>maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
