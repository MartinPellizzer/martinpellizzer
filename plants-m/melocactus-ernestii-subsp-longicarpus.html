<p>Melocactus ernestii subsp.</p>
<p>longicarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines and produces large, showy yellow flowers during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant's fruit is a long, segmented berry that matures to a reddish color, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens in arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
