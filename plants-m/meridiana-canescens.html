                    <h1>Meridiana canescens</h1>
<p>Meridiana canescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, semi-arid climates.</p>
