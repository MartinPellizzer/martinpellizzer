<p>Melocactus uebelmannii, commonly known as the Uebelmann's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces a single, large, spiny fruit that resembles a melon, which is typically yellow or orange in color. Its stems are covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
