<p>Melaleuca gummifera, commonly known as the sticky leaf melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, often glandular leaves that release a sticky resin when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. Its bark is typically smooth and may exude a gum-like substance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Melaleuca gummifera is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments.</p>
