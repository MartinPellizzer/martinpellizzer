<p>Metathelypteris krameri, commonly known as the Krameri water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates while facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups.</p>
