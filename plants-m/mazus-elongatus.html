<p>Mazus elongatus, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mazus elongatus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its dense, spreading growth habit.</p>
