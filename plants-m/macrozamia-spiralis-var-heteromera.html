<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. heteromera, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiraling arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered with a thick, fibrous bark. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a waxy texture and a deep green color, and they can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
