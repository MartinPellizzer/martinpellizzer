<p>Mystacidium erythropollinium, commonly known as the red pollen moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and reddish-brown coloration, which is particularly noticeable in its spore capsules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Mystacidium erythropollinium plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
