                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy ghost plant, is a rare and elusive member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees in shaded, forested environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its hairy, woolly stems and leaves give it a distinctive texture and contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
