<p>Mormodes rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforest, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mormodes rodrigoi is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
