The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
