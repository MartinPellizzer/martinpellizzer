<p>Margaretta rosea subsp.</p>
<p>kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro margaret rose, is a subshrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
