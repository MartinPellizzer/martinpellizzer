                    <h1>Melocactus obovatus</h1>
<p>Melocactus obovatus, commonly known as the round-leaf melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that is often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus obovatus is a slow-growing cactus that is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique shape and resilience.</p>
