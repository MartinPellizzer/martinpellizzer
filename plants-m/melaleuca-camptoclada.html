<p>Melaleuca camptoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, revealing a pale inner surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Melaleuca camptoclada is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
