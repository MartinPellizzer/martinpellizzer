<p>Martinezia lindeniana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Martinezia lindeniana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
