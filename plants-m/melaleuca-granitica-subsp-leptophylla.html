                    <h1>Melaleuca granitica subsp. leptophylla</h1>
<p>Melaleuca granitica subsp.</p>
<p>leptophylla, commonly known as the granite melaleuca, is a rare and specialized plant endemic to the granite outcrops of south-western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its rocky habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the unique biodiversity found in granite-derived ecosystems.</p>
