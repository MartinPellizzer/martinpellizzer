                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. flaccida, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin and a distinctive minty aroma. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a ground cover in gardens due to its hardy nature and aromatic properties.</p>
