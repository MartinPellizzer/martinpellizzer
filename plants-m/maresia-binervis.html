                    <h1>Maresia binervis</h1>
<p>Maresia binervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Maresia binervis plays a role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
