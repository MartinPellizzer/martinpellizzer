<p>Medicago sphaerocarpos var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States.</p>

The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
