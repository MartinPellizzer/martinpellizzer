                    <h1>Monogramma graminoides</h1>
<p>Monogramma graminoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant features slender, wiry rhizomes that form a mat-like growth, often carpeting rocky or shaded ground. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear fronds that give it a grass-like appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Monogramma graminoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
