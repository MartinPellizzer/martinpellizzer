<p>Marsilea ballardii, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, clover-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Marsilea ballardii is often used in aquatic gardens and is also a food source for various aquatic animals.</p>
