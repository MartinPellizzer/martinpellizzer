<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance with slender stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its unique botanical traits.</p>
