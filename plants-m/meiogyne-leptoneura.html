                    <h1>Meiogyne leptoneura</h1>
<p>Meiogyne leptoneura, commonly known as the slender-veined meiogyne, is a rare and distinctive member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, followed by edible fruits that are small and fleshy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical research.</p>
