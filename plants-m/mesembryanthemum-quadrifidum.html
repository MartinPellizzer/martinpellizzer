                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum quadrifidum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum quadrifidum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the cooler months. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to tolerate full sun.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum quadrifidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
