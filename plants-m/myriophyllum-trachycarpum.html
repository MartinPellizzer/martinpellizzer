                    <h1>Myriophyllum trachycarpum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum trachycarpum, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it blooms in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum trachycarpum is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense underwater mats.</p>
