                    <h1>Microstylis marginata</h1>
<p>Microstylis marginata, commonly known as the narrow-styled margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures. Microstylis marginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
