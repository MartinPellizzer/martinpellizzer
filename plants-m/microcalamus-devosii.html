<p>Microcalamus devosii, commonly known as the Devos' chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microcalamus devosii thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
