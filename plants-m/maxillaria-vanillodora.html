<p>Maxillaria vanillodora, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, vanilla-scented flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and evergreen, providing a lush canopy that supports its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>The orchid's ability to produce a scent reminiscent of vanilla has made it a subject of both botanical and commercial interest.</p>
