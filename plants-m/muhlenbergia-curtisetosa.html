                    <h1>Muhlenbergia curtisetosa</h1>
<p>Muhlenbergia curtisetosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, linear leaves that are often covered in a silvery-blue bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets, typical of many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is also used in erosion control and as a wildlife habitat plant.</p>
