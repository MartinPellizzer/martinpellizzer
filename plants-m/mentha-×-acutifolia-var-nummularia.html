                    <h1>Mentha × acutifolia var. nummularia</h1>
<p>Mentha × acutifolia var. nummularia, commonly known as penny mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and oval, slightly hairy leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its visual appeal and mild mint-like fragrance.</p>
