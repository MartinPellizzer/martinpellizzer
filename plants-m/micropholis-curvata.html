                    <h1>Micropholis curvata</h1>
<p>Micropholis curvata, commonly known as the curved micropholis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Micropholis curvata is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dune environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions make it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
