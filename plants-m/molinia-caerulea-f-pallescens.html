                    <h1>Molinia caerulea f. pallescens</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and heathlands. The plant features narrow, pale blue-green blades that are shorter and more compact than the typical form. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments.</p>
