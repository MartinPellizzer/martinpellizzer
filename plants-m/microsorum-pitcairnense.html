<p>Microsorum pitcairnense, commonly known as the Pitcairn fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often form a dense, floating mat on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Microsorum pitcairnense is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
