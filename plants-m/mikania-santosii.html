<p>Mikania santosii, commonly known as the Santosii mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing climbing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Mikania santosii is known for its aggressive growth habit, which can make it a problematic invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as a weed in some parts of the world.</p>
