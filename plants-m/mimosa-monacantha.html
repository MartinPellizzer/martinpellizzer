                    <h1>Mimosa monacantha</h1>
<p>Mimosa monacantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique movement and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
