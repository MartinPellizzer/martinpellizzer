<p>Mariscus swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's mariscus, is a small, perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to fire-prone environments. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, characterized by its Mediterranean climate and nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
