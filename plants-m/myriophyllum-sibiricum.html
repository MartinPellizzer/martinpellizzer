<p>Myriophyllum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that float on the water surface, typically in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum sibiricum is often invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native aquatic vegetation.</p>
