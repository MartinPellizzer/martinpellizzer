                    <h1>Myristica extensa</h1>
<p>Myristica extensa, commonly known as the African nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen belonging to the Myristicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Central and Eastern Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy fruits. The seeds inside the fruits are the source of the aromatic spice known as nutmeg, though it is less commercially significant than its relative, Myristica fragrans.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and potential medicinal contexts.</p>
