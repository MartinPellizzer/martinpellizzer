                    <h1>Monustes</h1>
<p>Monustes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like appearance and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Monustes is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
