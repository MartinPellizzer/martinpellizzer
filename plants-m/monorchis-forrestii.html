                    <h1>Monorchis forrestii</h1>
<p>Monorchis forrestii, commonly known as the Forest Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with intricate, folded petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with a dark red or purple stripe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monorchis forrestii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
