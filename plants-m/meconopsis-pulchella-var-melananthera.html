                    <h1>Meconopsis pulchella var. melananthera</h1>
<p>Meconopsis pulchella var. melananthera, commonly known as the black anther meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black anthers, which contrast sharply with its pale blue or violet petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually solitary and bloom in early summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
