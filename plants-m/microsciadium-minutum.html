<p>Microsciadium minutum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with small, rounded leaves that help in reducing water resistance.</p>
<p>Microsciadium minutum is often found in nutrient-rich environments and plays a role in aquatic food webs by providing habitat and food for microorganisms.</p>
