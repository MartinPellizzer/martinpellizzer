                    <h1>Micropus erectus var. multicaulis</h1>
<p>Micropus erectus var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered burro bush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit, with numerous short, upright branches forming a compact, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
