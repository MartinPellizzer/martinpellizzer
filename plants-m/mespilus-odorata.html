<p>Mespilus odorata, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop flavor after picking. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is characterized by a tough, leathery exterior and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature.</p>
<p>The medlar is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
