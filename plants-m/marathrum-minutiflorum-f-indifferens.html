The plant produces umbellate inflorescences, a feature typical of many members of its family, and has finely divided leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
