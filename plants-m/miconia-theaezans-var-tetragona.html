                    <h1>Miconia theaezans var. tetragona</h1>
<p>Miconia theaezans var. tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled miconia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive orange or red berries. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
