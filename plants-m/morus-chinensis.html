                    <h1>Morus chinensis</h1>
<p>Morus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces small, fuzzy berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its bark, which has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its role in silk production, as its leaves are a food source for silkworms.</p>
