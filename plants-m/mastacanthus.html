<p>Mastacanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Mastacanthus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
