<p>Mariscus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its broad, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Mariscus macrophyllus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
