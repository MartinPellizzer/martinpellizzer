                    <h1>Machilus minutilobus</h1>
<p>Machilus minutilobus, commonly known as the small-lobed machilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, particularly found in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark-colored berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Machilus minutilobus is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range.</p>
