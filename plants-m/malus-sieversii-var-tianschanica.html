                    <h1>Malus sieversii var. tianschanica</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii var. tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan crabapple, is a wild apple species native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its rugged, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart fruits that are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is typically greyish and fissured.</p>
<p>This variety is considered a progenitor of many cultivated apple varieties due to its genetic diversity and adaptability to harsh mountain environments.</p>
