                    <h1>Melasma scabrum var. ovatum</h1>
<p>Melasma scabrum var. ovatum, commonly known as the rough skin lichen, is a variant of the species Melasma scabrum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and scaly appearance, which is typical of the lichen family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a dense, crust-like structure formed by the union of fungal hyphae and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>This unique morphology allows it to survive in harsh conditions by reducing water loss and increasing resistance to environmental stress.</p>
