                    <h1>Mannia</h1>
<p>Mannia, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree belonging to the Tamaricaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in catkins. The plant is native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing in saline or arid environments. Mannia has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal lands.</p>
