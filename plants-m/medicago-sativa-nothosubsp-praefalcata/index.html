<p>Alfalfa, scientifically known as Medicago sativa nothosubsp. praefalcata, is a perennial legume widely cultivated for its high nutritional value and agricultural versatility. This subspecies, a hybrid variant of the common alfalfa, exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from its parent species. Native to the Mediterranean region, it has been introduced to various climates worldwide for use in livestock feed and soil enrichment. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion while fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it an eco-friendly crop. Due to its adaptability and resilience, it remains a vital component of sustainable farming practices.</p>
