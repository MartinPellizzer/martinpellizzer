<p>Melocactus capillaris, commonly known as the feathered melon, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, woolly covering that protects it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Melocactus capillaris is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
