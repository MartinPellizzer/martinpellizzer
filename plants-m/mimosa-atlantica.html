<p>Mimosa atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch.

It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
