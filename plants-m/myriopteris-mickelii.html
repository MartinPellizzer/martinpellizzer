                    <h1>Myriopteris mickelii</h1>
<p>Myriopteris mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems.</p>
