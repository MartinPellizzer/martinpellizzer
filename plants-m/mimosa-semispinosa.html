                    <h1>Mimosa semispinosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa semispinosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its unique morphological features and adaptive responses make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
