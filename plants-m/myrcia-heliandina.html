<p>Myrcia heliandina, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and moist forests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in its introduced ranges.</p>
