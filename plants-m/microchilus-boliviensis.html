<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
