                    <h1>Melilotus occidentalis</h1>
<p>Melilotus occidentalis, commonly known as sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and Asia but now widely naturalized in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Sweet clover is known for its aromatic, sweet-smelling flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agriculture.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
