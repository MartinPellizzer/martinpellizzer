                    <h1>Monotropa lanuginosa var. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Monotropa lanuginosa var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the ghost plant or Indian tobacco, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants and derives some of its nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>The variety glabriuscula is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of Monotropa lanuginosa.</p>
