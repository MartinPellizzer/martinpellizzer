<p>Melocactus lamarckii, commonly known as the red spiny apple, is a species of cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus lamarckii is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
