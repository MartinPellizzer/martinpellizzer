<p>Mulinum spinosum var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rapid vegetative spread make it an effective colonizer of disturbed areas.</p>
