                    <h1>Mendoncia neblinensis</h1>
<p>Mendoncia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on rock faces or in shaded understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the mist, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Mendoncia neblinensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
