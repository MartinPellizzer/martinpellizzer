<p>Micropteryx suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions with dry, rocky soils, such as parts of southern Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Micropteryx suberosa is often found growing in crevices or on slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
