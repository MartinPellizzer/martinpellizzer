                    <h1>Melica schimperi</h1>
<p>Melica schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian quillwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the highland regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Melica schimperi thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
