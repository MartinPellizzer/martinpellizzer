                    <h1>Megalastrum squamosissimum var. bogotense</h1>
<p>Megalastrum squamosissimum var. bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot√° starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean highlands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This plant thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
