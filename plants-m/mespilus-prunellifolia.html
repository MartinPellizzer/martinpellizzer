                    <h1>Mespilus prunellifolia</h1>
<p>Mespilus prunellifolia, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in the autumn, though they are typically harvested when they are partially decayed, a process known as "mumming.". Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and greyish in younger trees.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
