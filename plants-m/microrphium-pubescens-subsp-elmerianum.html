<p>Microrphium pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>elmerianum, commonly known as the Elmer's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is sometimes considered an indicator species for oligotrophic conditions.</p>
