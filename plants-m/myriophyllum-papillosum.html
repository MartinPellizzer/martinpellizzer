<p>Myriophyllum papillosum, commonly known as the featherleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it can form dense mats that influence water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum papillosum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
