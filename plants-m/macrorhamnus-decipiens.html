                    <h1>Macrorhamnus decipiens</h1>
<p>Macrorhamnus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Due to its deceptive appearance and limited distribution, it is a relatively rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
