                    <h1>Magnolia lawii</h1>
<p>Magnolia lawii, commonly known as the Kauai magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Magnolia lawii is considered critically endangered.</p>
