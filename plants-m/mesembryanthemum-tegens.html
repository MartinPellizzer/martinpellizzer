<p>Mesembryanthemum tegens, commonly known as the "Cape Hottentot" or "Ice Plant," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue or purple, leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum tegens is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
