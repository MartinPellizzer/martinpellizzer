<p>Myrmecodia albertisii subsp.</p>
<p>valida, commonly known as the ant-plant or honeycomb plant, is a unique epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which provide shelter for ants.</p>
<p>These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
