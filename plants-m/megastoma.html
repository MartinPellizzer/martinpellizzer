                    <h1>Megastoma</h1>
<p>Megastoma, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Megastoma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants or substrates.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations for carnivory and their role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
