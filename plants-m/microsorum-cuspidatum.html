                    <h1>Microsorum cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Microsorum cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum cuspidatum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
