                    <h1>Malacochaete oligostachya</h1>
<p>Malacochaete oligostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often branched and hairy. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, often growing in association with grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying parasitic plants.</p>
