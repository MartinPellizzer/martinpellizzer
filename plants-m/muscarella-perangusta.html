                    <h1>Muscarella perangusta</h1>
<p>Muscarella perangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved muscaria, is a member of the Amanitaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white cap with a distinct ring and volva, and its slender, fibrous stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest floors, where it forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree roots. Its fruiting bodies are often mistaken for edible mushrooms due to their appearance, but they are toxic and should not be consumed.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to mycologists due to its unique ecological role and chemical composition.</p>
