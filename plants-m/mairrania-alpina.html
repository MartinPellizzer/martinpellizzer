                    <h1>Mairrania alpina</h1>
<p>Mairrania alpina, commonly known as the alpine mairrania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often blue or purple in color. It has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Mairrania alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
