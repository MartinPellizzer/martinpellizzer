                    <h1>Macropsychanthus violaceus</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus violaceus, commonly known as the violet-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, violet-hued flowers that bloom on slender, often hairless stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
