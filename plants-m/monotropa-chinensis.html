                    <h1>Monotropa chinensis</h1>
<p>Monotropa chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a cluster of elongated, thread-like leaves.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth of its host plants.</p>
