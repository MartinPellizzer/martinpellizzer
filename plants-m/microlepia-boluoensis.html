<p>Microlepia boluoensis, commonly known as the Boluo mountain fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
