                    <h1>Mammillaria vivipara var. vera</h1>
<p>Mammillaria vivipara var. vera, commonly known as the Viviparous Mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. One of its most distinctive features is its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before dispersal.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive method makes it a fascinating subject for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike.</p>
