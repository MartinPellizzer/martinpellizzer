                    <h1>Morella parvifolia</h1>
<p>Morella parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and berries have been used historically for various purposes, including making candles and dyes.</p>
