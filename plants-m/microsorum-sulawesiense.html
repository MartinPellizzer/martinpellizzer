<p>Microsorum sulawesiense, commonly known as the Sulawesi water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, ribbon-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>Microsorum sulawesiense is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
