<p>Menodora mexicana, commonly known as Mexican moonseed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Menodoridae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that split open to release seeds.
