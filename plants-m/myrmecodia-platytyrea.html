                    <h1>Myrmecodia platytyrea</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia platytyrea, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow structure, providing shelter for ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which in turn protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are small and clustered, and it produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>This plant is popular among horticulturists for its unusual appearance and ecological interest.</p>
