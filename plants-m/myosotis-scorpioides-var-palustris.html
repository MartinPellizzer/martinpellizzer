<p>Myosotis scorpioides var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with five petals. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
