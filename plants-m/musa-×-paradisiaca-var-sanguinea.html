                    <h1>Musa × paradisiaca var. sanguinea</h1>
<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its striking red-colored pseudostems and leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, and it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often display a deep red to purple hue, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>While the fruit is edible, it is smaller and less sweet compared to other banana varieties.</p>
