<p>Maytenus manabiensis, commonly known as the Manabi mayten, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Maytenus manabiensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafts.</p>
