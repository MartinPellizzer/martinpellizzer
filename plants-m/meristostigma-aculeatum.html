                    <h1>Meristostigma aculeatum</h1>
<p>Meristostigma aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit and its ability to trap prey using specialized bladder-like structures called ventral bladders. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often submerged in water. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured insects.</p>
