                    <h1>Manihot oaxacana</h1>
<p>Manihot oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca arrowleaf, is a shrub native to Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, arrow-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its roots contain high levels of starch, making it a potential source of food in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, the plant is toxic due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid, requiring careful handling.</p>
