<p>Mesembryanthemum lawsonii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or African star-of-Bethleham, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals that resemble stars, blooming during the cooler months. Its fruit, a small, round berry, is edible and has a tangy, citrus-like flavor.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum lawsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
