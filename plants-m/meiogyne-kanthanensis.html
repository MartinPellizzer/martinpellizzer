                    <h1>Meiogyne kanthanensis</h1>
<p>Meiogyne kanthanensis, commonly known as the Thai water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble ferns. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of water bodies while its leaves float on the surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meiogyne kanthanensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
