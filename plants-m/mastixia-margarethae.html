                    <h1>Mastixia margarethae</h1>
<p>Mastixia margarethae, commonly known as the Margaret's mastixia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact and shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Mastixia margarethae is well adapted to sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
