                    <h1>Monnina arenicola</h1>
<p>Monnina arenicola, commonly known as sand mallow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Monnina arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
