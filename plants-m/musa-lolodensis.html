<p>Musa lolodensis, commonly known as the African banana, is a wild banana species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of yellowish-green bananas that mature in the shade. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. It has a fibrous pseudostem and produces berries that are edible but less commonly consumed than cultivated bananas.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs.</p>
