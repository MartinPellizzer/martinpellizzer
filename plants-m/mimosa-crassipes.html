<p>Mimosa crassipes, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Mimosa crassipes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
