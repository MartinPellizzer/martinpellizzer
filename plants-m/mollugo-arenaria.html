                    <h1>Mollugo arenaria</h1>
<p>Mollugo arenaria, commonly known as sand pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Mollugo arenaria is often found in dunes, rocky shores, and disturbed coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
