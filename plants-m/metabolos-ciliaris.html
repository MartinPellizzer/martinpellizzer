                    <h1>Metabolos ciliaris</h1>
<p>Metabolos ciliaris, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its sticky seeds are often dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>Metabolos ciliaris plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
