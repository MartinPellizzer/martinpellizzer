<p>Mucuna persericea, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields.</p>
<p>Mucuna persericea is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems.</p>
