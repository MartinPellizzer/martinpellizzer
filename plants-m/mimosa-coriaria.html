<p>Mimosa coriaria, commonly known as the European mimosa, is a small deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>
