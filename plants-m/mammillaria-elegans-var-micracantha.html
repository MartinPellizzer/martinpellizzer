<p>Mammillaria elegans var. micracantha, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale yellow tubercles, each adorned with clusters of radial spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
