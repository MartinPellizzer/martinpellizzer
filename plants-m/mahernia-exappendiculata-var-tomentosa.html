                    <h1>Mahernia exappendiculata var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Mahernia exappendiculata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mahernia, is a rare and unusual plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
