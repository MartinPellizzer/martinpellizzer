                    <h1>Mimosa setosa var. paludosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa setosa var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, often in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in marshy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
