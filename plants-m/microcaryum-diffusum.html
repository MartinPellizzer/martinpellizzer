                    <h1>Microcaryum diffusum</h1>
<p>Microcaryum diffusum, commonly known as the scattered microcaryum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist habitats.</p>
<p>Microcaryum diffusum is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils.</p>
