<p>Mesembryanthemum praecultum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
