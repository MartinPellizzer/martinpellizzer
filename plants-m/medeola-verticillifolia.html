<p>Medeola verticillifolia, commonly known as the bluebead lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each leaf stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form clumps over time.</p>
<p>Medeola verticillifolia is known for its striking blue berries that appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to woodland gardens.</p>
