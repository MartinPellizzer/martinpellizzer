                    <h1>Monanthes subrosulata</h1>
<p>Monanthes subrosulata, commonly known as the silverleaf monanthes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in shrublands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
