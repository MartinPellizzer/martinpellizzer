<p>Malaxis ehrenbergii var. platyglossa, commonly known as the flat-lipped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme, which are often inconspicuous but attract specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
