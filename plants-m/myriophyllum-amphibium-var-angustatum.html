                    <h1>Myriophyllum amphibium var. angustatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum amphibium var. angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often tinged with red, and its small, opposite leaves are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
