<p>Milium alpicola, commonly known as the alpine millet, is a small, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Milium alpicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
