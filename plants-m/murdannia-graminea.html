<p>Murdannia graminea, commonly known as the slender grass-of-Parnassus, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on short, leafy stalks.
