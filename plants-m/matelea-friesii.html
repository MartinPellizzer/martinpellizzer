<p>Matelea friesii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy.
