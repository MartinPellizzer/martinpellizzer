                    <h1>Macrozamia spiralis var. corallipes</h1>
<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. corallipes, commonly known as the coral-pink cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking, almost architectural appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly showy and often tinged with a coral-pink hue. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to environmental threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
