                    <h1>Malaxis micheliana</h1>
<p>Malaxis micheliana, commonly known as the Michel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
