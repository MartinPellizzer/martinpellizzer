                    <h1>Myosotis scorpioides var. laxa</h1>
<p>Myosotis scorpioides var. laxa, commonly known as the slender forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the common forget-me-not, though it is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flower clusters.</p>
