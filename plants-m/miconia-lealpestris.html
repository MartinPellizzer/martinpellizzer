<p>Miconia lealpestris, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. Its foliage and fruit are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
