<p>Mimosa kantuffa, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Mimosa kantuffa is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
