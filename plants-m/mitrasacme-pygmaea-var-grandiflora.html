                    <h1>Mitrasacme pygmaea var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Mitrasacme pygmaea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant-flowered pygmy mistletoe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or orange in color, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is usually found growing as a hemiparasite on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
