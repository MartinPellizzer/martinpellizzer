                    <h1>Myrica cerifera</h1>
<p>Myrica cerifera, commonly known as蜡树 or candleberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark that exudes a fragrant, resinous scent when cut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica cerifera thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats.</p>
<p>It has been historically used for its wax, which can be harvested from the bark, and for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
