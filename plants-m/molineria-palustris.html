                    <h1>Molineria palustris</h1>
<p>Molineria palustris, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Molineria palustris plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
