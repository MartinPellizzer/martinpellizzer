<p>Minuartia nuttallii subsp.</p>
<p>gregaria, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
