<p>Marshallia, commonly known as the pink coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southeastern United States and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Marshallia species typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. They have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produce cylindrical flower heads that are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
