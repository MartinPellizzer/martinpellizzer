<p>Myristica subalulata var. paucifructa, commonly known as the rare nutmeg relative, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits and distinctive, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are predominantly male, with female flowers occurring in smaller numbers. Its fruits contain a single, large seed surrounded by a fragrant, oily aril, similar to the nutmeg fruit of Myristica fragrans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low fruiting rate, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
