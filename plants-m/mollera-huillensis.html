                    <h1>Mollera huillensis</h1>
<p>Mollera huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n rockmoss, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean highlands of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, specifically adapted to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant exhibits a low, sprawling growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
