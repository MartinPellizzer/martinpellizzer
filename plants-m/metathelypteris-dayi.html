<p>Metathelypteris dayi, commonly known as the Guangxi water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
