                    <h1>Microstrobilus stenurus</h1>
<p>Microstrobilus stenurus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and the presence of microstrobili, which are tiny, cone-like structures that bear the plant's spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its dense, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>Microstrobilus stenurus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability.</p>
