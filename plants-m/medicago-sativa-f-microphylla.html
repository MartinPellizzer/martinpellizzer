                    <h1>Medicago sativa f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Medicago sativa f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alfalfa, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to standard alfalfa.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three small, rounded leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often used in forage production and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it valuable in both agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
