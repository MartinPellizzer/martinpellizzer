                    <h1>Microchaeta lobata var. hastulata</h1>
<p>Microchaeta lobata var. hastulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microchaeta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, upright stems covered with fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctively narrow base, and are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations.</p>
