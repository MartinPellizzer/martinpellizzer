                    <h1>Mabea uleana</h1>
<p>Mabea uleana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in several countries.</p>
