<p>Myristica zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippelian nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice-like seeds used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has glossy, elliptical leaves. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and phytochemistry.</p>
