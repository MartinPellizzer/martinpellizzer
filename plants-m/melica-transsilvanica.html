<p>Melica transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, particularly found in the Carpathian region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Melica transsilvanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
