<p>Melocactus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by orange or red fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant.</p>
