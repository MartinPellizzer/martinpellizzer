                    <h1>Miraglossum</h1>
<p>Miraglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant found primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Miraglossum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
