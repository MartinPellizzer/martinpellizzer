                    <h1>Mentha satureioides var. microcalyx</h1>
<p>Mentha satureioides var. microcalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other Mentha species due to its similar appearance and strong mint-like fragrance.</p>
