<p>Mirandorchis calvilabris, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including hairy stems and leaves, which are adaptations to its particular ecological niche. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mirandorchis calvilabris is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
