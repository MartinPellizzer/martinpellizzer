                    <h1>Melampyrum laxum f. edentatum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum laxum f. edentatum, commonly known as the toothless yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in areas with acidic soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by the absence of teeth on its leaf margins, giving it its common name.</p>
