<p>Musa maclayi subsp.</p>
<p>maclayi, commonly known as the Maclay's banana, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Musa genus. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, curved fruits. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for food, due to the inedibility of its fruit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and potential for genetic research.</p>
