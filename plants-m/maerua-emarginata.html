<p>Maerua emarginata, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Maerua emarginata also plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
