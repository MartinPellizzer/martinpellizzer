<p>Mimulopsis solmsii var. orophila, commonly known as the alpine mimulopsis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
