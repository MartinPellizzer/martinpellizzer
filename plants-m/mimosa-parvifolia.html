<p>Mimosa parvifolia, commonly known as the smallleaf sensitiveplant, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes.</p>
<p>Mimosa parvifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility.</p>
