                    <h1>Microgramma mortoniana</h1>
<p>Microgramma mortoniana, commonly known as the Morton's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense patches over time.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slender structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
