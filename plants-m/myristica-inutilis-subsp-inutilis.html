                    <h1>Myristica inutilis subsp. inutilis</h1>
<p>Myristica inutilis subsp.</p>
<p>inutilis, commonly known as the useless nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This evergreen tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring compound leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing aromatic seeds. While its close relative, Myristica fragrans, is well-known for its nutmeg and mace, M. inutilis subsp. inutilis is less commercially valuable and less widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a species within the Myristica genus and its ecological importance in tropical forests.</p>
