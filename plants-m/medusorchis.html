                    <h1>Medusorchis</h1>
<p>Medusorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid found primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, with pale green or white petals and sepals. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a striking example of adaptation to its environment. Medusorchis thrives in humid, shaded habitats, often growing on trees or rocks in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
