<p>Munnozia taeniotricha, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Munnozia taeniotricha plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
