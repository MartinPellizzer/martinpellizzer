                    <h1>Malus × floribunda lemoinei</h1>
<p>Malus × floribunda lemoinei, commonly known as the weeping apple, is a hybrid species of apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>It is native to China and was developed through crossbreeding between Malus prunifolia and Malus baccata. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible red or yellow berries. Its ornamental value comes from its striking, drooping foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The tree is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
