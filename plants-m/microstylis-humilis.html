                    <h1>Microstylis humilis</h1>
<p>Microstylis humilis, commonly known as the small-styled grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Microstylis humilis is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
