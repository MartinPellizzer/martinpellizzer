<p>Mammillaria hepatica, commonly known as the liver-shaped mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for small containers.</p>
<p>Mammillaria hepatica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
