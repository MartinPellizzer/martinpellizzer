                    <h1>Myrtus repens</h1>
<p>Myrtus repens, commonly known as creeping myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Myrtus repens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
