The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that are typically hairy and contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
