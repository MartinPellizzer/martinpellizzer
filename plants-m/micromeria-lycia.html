                    <h1>Micromeria lycia</h1>
<p>Micromeria lycia, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its small, compact growth habit makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Micromeria lycia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
