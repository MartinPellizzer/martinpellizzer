<p>Mesembryanthemum repens, commonly known as the ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
