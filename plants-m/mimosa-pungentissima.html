                    <h1>Mimosa pungentissima</h1>
<p>Mimosa pungentissima, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and wasps. Its distinctive, strong odor has led to its common name, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Despite its pungent scent, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
