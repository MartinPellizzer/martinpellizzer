<p>Myosotis laxa f. neglecta, commonly known as the slender forget-me-not, is a botanical variant of the forget-me-not genus characterized by its delicate blue-violet flowers and slender, creeping stems.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
