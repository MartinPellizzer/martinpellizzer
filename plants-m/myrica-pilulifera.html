<p>Myrica pilulifera, commonly known as the bayberry or candleberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, waxy berries that turn red or orange in the fall, which are edible but have a sweet, slightly tart flavor. Myrica pilulifera thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has historical uses in traditional medicine and for making candles due to its aromatic oils.</p>
