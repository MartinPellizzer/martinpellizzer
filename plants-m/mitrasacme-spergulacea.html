<p>Mitrasacme spergulacea, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Mitrasacme spergulacea is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
