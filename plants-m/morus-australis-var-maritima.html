<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in coastal stabilization projects.</p>
