<p>Mesopanax, commonly known as the "Chinese nettle," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Mesopanax species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
