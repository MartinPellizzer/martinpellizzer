                    <h1>Melocactus actinacanthus</h1>
<p>Melocactus actinacanthus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its adaptations include a deep root system for water absorption and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Melocactus actinacanthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience in dry environments.</p>
