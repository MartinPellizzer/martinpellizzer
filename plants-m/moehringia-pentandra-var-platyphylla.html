<p>Moehringia pentandra var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved moehringia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
