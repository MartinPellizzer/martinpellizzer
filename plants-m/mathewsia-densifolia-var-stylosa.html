                    <h1>Mathewsia densifolia var. stylosa</h1>
<p>Mathewsia densifolia var. stylosa, commonly known as the denseleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily eucalyptus species, through its haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The varietal form, stylosa, is distinguished by its more compact growth and dense leaf arrangement compared to other varieties.</p>
