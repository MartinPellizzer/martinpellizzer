                            <h1>Marica Tinctoria</h1>
<p>Indian madder, scientifically known as Marica tinctoria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It has been used for centuries as a natural dye source, producing vibrant red hues. The plant's roots contain a rich pigment called alizarin, which has historically been prized in textile and art industries. Despite its historical significance, Indian madder is often overlooked in modern botany and agriculture. Its potential for sustainable dye production continues to inspire interest in eco-friendly practices.</p>
