                    <h1>Microlepia gigantea</h1>
<p>Microlepia gigantea, commonly known as the giant microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>Microlepia gigantea is often found in moist, shaded forest environments where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
