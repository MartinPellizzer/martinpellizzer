<p>Mammillaria magallanii var. hamatispina, commonly known as the Spiny Mammillaria, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with prominent, sharp spines that are often tinged with yellow or brown. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, followed by small, reddish fruits. Its fleshy, ribbed structure is adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It requires bright light, well-draining soil, and minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
