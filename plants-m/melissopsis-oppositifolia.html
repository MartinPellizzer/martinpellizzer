                    <h1>Melissopsis oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Melissopsis oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved melissopsis, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
