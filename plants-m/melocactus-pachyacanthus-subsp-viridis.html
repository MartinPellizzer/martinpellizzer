<p>Melocactus pachyacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>viridis, commonly known as the green melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height.</p>
<p>The plant features a dense covering of short, cylindrical spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its succulent stem and exhibiting a slow growth rate.</p>
