                    <h1>Myrceugenia scutellata</h1>
<p>Myrceugenia scutellata, commonly known as the strawberry guava, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are sweet and aromatic, often mistaken for true strawberries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through bird-dispersed seeds.</p>
