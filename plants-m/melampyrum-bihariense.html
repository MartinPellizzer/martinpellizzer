                    <h1>Melampyrum bihariense</h1>
<p>Melampyrum bihariense, commonly known as the Kashmir flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically reddish or orange in color, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Melampyrum bihariense is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
