                    <h1>Mulguraea tetragonocalyx</h1>
<p>Mulguraea tetragonocalyx, commonly known as the four-angled mulga, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems that form a dense, sprawling structure, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mulguraea tetragonocalyx plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native environment.</p>
