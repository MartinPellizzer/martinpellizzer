<p>Manfreda parva, commonly known as the dwarf manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
