                    <h1>Mollinedia howeana</h1>
<p>Mollinedia howeana, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that grow in a dense, compact form. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found on cliffs and in forested areas. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
