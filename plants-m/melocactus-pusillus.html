                    <h1>Melocactus pusillus</h1>
<p>Melocactus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf melon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its stem is ribbed and can store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus pusillus is often grown as a decorative plant due to its compact size and unique appearance.</p>
