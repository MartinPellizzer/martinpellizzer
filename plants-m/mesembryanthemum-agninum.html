<p>Mesembryanthemum agninum, commonly known as the African carpet or silver leaf, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Mesembryanthemum agninum is widely cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
