                    <h1>Mentha discolor</h1>
<p>Mentha discolor, commonly known as the blue mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves that are typically a mix of green and blue on the upper and lower surfaces, respectively. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Mentha discolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in herbal teas and for its refreshing scent, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species.</p>
