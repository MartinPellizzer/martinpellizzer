<p>Micromeles vestita, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are dry pods that dehisce to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Micromeles vestita is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
