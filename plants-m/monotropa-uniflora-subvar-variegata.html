<p>Monotropa uniflora subvar. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ghostplant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>This evergreen herbaceous plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. It produces a single, showy white or pale green flower during late summer. The plant's leaves are usually dark green with white or yellow variegation, and it often grows in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
