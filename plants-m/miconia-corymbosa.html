                    <h1>Miconia corymbosa</h1>
<p>Miconia corymbosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a weed in many tropical ecosystems.</p>
