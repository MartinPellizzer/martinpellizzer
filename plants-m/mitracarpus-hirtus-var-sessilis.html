                    <h1>Mitracarpus hirtus var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus hirtus var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its fruits are dry, indehiscent capsules that mature into distinctive, thimble-like structures.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sessile (short-stemmed) inflorescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Mitracarpus.</p>
