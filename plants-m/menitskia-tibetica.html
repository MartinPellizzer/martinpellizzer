<p>Menitskia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan menitskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, palmately lobed fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of alpine flora and medicinal plant resources in the region.</p>
