<p>Mikania badieri f. kittsiana, commonly known as the Kittsiana variant of the creeping mikania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and trailing habit. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by finely divided, feathery leaves. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic.</p>
