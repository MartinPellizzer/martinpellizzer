                    <h1>Monotropa glabra</h1>
<p>Monotropa glabra, commonly known as Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in the forests of North America, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the host plant.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
