                    <h1>Malaxis zempoalensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis zempoalensis, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
