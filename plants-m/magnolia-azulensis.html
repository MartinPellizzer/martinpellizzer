                    <h1>Magnolia azulensis</h1>
<p>Magnolia azulensis, commonly known as the blue magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy blue-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
