<p>Meliosma arenosa, commonly known as the sand meliosma, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Meliosma arenosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soils.</p>
