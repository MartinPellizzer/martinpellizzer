                    <h1>Microphyes litoralis</h1>
<p>Microphyes litoralis, commonly known as the coastal microphyte, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to sandy shorelines.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal zones where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its roots help prevent erosion by binding the sand together.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a key indicator species for coastal ecosystem health.</p>
