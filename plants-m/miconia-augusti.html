                    <h1>Miconia augusti</h1>
<p>Miconia augusti, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a unique fruit structure that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
