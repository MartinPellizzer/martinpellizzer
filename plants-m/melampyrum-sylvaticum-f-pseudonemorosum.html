<p>Melampyrum sylvaticum f. pseudonemorosum, commonly known as the false toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in woodland and shaded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Melampyrum sylvaticum.</p>
