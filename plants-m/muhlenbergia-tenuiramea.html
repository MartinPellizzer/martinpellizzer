<p>Muhlenbergia tenuiramea, commonly known as slender muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
