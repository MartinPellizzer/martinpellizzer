<p>Manettia ignita var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf manettia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery down.
