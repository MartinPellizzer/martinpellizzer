<p>Microtinus simonsii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Microtinus simonsii plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in sandy environments.</p>
