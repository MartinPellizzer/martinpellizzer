                    <h1>Mimosa interrupta</h1>
<p>Mimosa interrupta, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa interrupta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance.</p>
