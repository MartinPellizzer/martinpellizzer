<p>Mentzelia gracilenta var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh desert climates, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the Loasaceae family.</p>
