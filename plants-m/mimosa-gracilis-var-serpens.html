<p>Mimosa gracilis var. serpens, commonly known as the serpentine mimosa, is a climbing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
