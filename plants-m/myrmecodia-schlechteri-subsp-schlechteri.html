<p>Myrmecodia schlechteri subsp.</p>
<p>schlechteri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological role in tropical forests.</p>
