                    <h1>Medicago canescens</h1>
<p>Medicago canescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. It is widely used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Medicago canescens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
