                    <h1>Mariscus gracilis</h1>
<p>Mariscus gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>Mariscus gracilis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
