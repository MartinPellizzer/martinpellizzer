                    <h1>Mimosa gracilis var. genuina</h1>
<p>Mimosa gracilis var. genuina, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a delicate shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
