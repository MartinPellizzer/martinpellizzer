<p>Microsorum decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf java fern, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, narrow leaves that grow along the stem, often with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal. It reproduces through rhizomes, which can spread and form dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to filter water and provide shelter for aquatic life makes it a valuable addition to both natural and artificial aquatic ecosystems.</p>
