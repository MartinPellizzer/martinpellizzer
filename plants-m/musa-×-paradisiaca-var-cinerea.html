                    <h1>Musa × paradisiaca var. cinerea</h1>
<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray banana, is a variant of the common banana plant characterized by its distinctive grayish-brown coloration on the outer layer of the pseudostem.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid species within the Musa genus, typically cultivated for its edible fruit, which is similar to the Cavendish banana but with a slightly different flavor profile. The leaves are large, broad, and glossy, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, requiring consistent moisture for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is also grown for its fruit, which is generally smaller and less sweet compared to other banana varieties.</p>
