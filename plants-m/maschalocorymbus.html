<p>Maschalocorymbus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a yellow bud that gradually opens into a pink or red flower. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support its heavy, showy blooms, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems are long and flexible.</p>
<p>Maschalocorymbus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian societies.</p>
