                            <h1>Milium Maritimum</h1>
<p>Sea millet, scientifically known as Milium maritimum, is a resilient coastal plant that thrives in sandy and salty environments. Native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe, it has adapted to harsh conditions with its compact growth and salt-tolerant properties. This plant is often found along shorelines, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Despite its humble appearance, sea millet has been used traditionally for food and fiber in various cultures. Its unique characteristics make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
