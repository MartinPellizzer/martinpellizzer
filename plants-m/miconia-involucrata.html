                    <h1>Miconia involucrata</h1>
<p>Miconia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that are typically followed by round, fleshy fruits. Miconia involucrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems, though its invasive potential requires careful management.</p>
