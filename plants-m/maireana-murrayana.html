<p>Maireana murrayana, commonly known as Murray's maireana, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Its structure and morphology make it well-suited for use in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
