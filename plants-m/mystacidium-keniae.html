                    <h1>Mystacidium keniae</h1>
<p>Mystacidium keniae, commonly known as the Kenia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
