<p>Microsorum rampans, commonly known as the Java fern, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the substrate in aquariums or ponds. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is relatively easy to care for, making it a favorite among aquarists.</p>
