<p>Malaxis rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowski's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
