<p>Merimea arenarioides, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark grey or brownish thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. This lichen is typically found growing on rock surfaces, particularly sandstone, in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. Its structure consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Merimea arenarioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in harsh environments.</p>
