                    <h1>Maniltoa gemmipara</h1>
<p>Maniltoa gemmipara, commonly known as the gemmipara cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant reproduces through both vegetative propagation via gemmae and sexual reproduction through cones. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
