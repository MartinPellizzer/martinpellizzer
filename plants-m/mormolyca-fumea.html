<p>Mormolyca fumea, commonly known as the smoky mormolyca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, smoky-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual element to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Mormolyca fumea is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
