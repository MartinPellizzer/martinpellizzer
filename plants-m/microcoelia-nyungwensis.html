<p>Microcoelia nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe microcoelia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the montane forests of the Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or among dense vegetation. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Microcoelia nyungwensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the unique flora of the Eastern African region.</p>
