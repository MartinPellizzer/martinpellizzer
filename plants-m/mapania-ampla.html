<p>Mapania ampla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade over the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Mapania ampla plays a vital role in its ecosystem by offering habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
