<p>Mimosa porrecta, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and its ability to produce clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a unique response to touch, with its leaves closing when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Mimosa porrecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
