<p>Melaleuca amydra, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous layer underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Melaleuca amydra is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
