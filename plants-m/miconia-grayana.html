                    <h1>Miconia grayana</h1>
<p>Miconia grayana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are spherical, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions of Hawaii.</p>
