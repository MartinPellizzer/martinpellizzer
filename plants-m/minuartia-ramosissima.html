<p>Minuartia ramosissima, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with numerous branched stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found on sandstone outcrops in regions like North America and Europe.</p>
