                    <h1>Merostachys latifolia</h1>
<p>Merostachys latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, slender inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their attractive appearance and durability.</p>
