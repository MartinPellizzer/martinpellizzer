<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem and produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
