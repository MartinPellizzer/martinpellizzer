<p>Mononeuria muscorum, commonly known as the moss cushion, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its typically arid or shaded habitats. The plant has short, closely spaced shoots with leafy branches that are often covered in a layer of fine, silvery hairs. Its leaves are usually narrow and gradually tapering, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Mononeuria muscorum is often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
