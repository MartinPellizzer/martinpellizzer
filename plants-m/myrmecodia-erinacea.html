                    <h1>Myrmecodia erinacea</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia erinacea, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia erinacea is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests.</p>
