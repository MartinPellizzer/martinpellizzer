                    <h1>Mimosa emoryana var. canescens</h1>
<p>Mimosa emoryana var. canescens, commonly known as the gray mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The varietal name "canescens" refers to its grayish, hairy appearance, distinguishing it from other varieties of Mimosa emoryana.</p>
