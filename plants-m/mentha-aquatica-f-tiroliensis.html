                    <h1>Mentha aquatica f. tiroliensis</h1>
<p>Mentha aquatica f. tiroliensis, commonly known as Alpine water mint, is a rare and specialized variant of the water mint species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its preference for moist, calcareous soils in alpine environments. This subspecies is typically found in mountainous regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in shaded, stream-side habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild minty aroma, and it is often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>
