<p>Mabea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf mabea, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mabea microcarpa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
