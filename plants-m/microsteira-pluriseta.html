<p>Microsteira pluriseta, commonly known as the hairy microsteira, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust root system. The plant features narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Microsteira pluriseta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
