                    <h1>Mangenotiella stellata</h1>
<p>Mangenotiella stellata, commonly known as the star mangrove, is a rare and unique mangrove species found in specific coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorl pattern around the stem. The plant has adapted to brackish water environments, displaying specialized root systems that help it survive in fluctuating salinity levels. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces drupes that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important indicator species for mangrove ecosystems.</p>
