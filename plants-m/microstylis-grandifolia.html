                    <h1>Microstylis grandifolia</h1>
<p>Microstylis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf microstylis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of grasses. Microstylis grandifolia is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft substrates.</p>
