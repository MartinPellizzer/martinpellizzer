                    <h1>Modiola urticifolia</h1>
<p>Modiola urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in shaded woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its stinging hairs, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans unless cooked or processed.</p>
