                    <h1>Meringium triangulare</h1>
<p>Meringium triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled meringia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a unique triangular stem structure that gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, Meringium triangulare is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
