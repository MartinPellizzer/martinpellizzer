                    <h1>Monolophus phutokensis</h1>
<p>Monolophus phutokensis, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of golden-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Monolophus phutokensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
