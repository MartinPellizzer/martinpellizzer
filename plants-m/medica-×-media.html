                    <h1>Medica × media</h1>
<p>Medica × media, commonly known as the hybrid ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant that produces heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used for its ornamental value and its capacity to cover walls and trellises.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
