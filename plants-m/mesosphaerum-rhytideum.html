                    <h1>Mesosphaerum rhytideum</h1>
<p>Mesosphaerum rhytideum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum rhytideum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
