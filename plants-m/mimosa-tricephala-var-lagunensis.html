                    <h1>Mimosa tricephala var. lagunensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa tricephala var. lagunensis, commonly known as the Lagunensis Mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions like Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are sensitive to touch and fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or saline environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or ecological restoration projects.</p>
