                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum scapigerum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum scapigerum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces a gelatinous coating on its surfaces, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum scapigerum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
