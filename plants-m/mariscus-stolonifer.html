                    <h1>Mariscus stolonifer</h1>
<p>Mariscus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value, it is protected in many regions.</p>
