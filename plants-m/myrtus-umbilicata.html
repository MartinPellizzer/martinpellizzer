                    <h1>Myrtus umbilicata</h1>
<p>Myrtus umbilicata, commonly known as the coastal myrtle or sea myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Myrtus umbilicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
