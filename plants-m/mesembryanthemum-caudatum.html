                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum caudatum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum caudatum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and colorful, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in arid and coastal environments, adapting to harsh conditions through its thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers open during the day and close at night, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum caudatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
