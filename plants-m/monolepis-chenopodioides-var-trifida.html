                    <h1>Monolepis chenopodioides var. trifida</h1>
<p>Monolepis chenopodioides var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed goosefoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring succulent, trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, lemony-tasting seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant.</p>
