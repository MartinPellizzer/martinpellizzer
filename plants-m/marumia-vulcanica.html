                    <h1>Marumia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Marumia vulcanica, commonly known as the Fireflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, resembling flames against the dark foliage. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil and requires high levels of sunlight to flourish. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also serve as a protective mechanism against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Marumia vulcanica is often found growing on rocky slopes and near geothermal vents, where its adaptability to extreme conditions is evident.</p>
