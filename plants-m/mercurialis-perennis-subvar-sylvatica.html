                    <h1>Mercurialis perennis subvar. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Mercurialis perennis subvar. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland mercury, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps it compete effectively in shaded conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
