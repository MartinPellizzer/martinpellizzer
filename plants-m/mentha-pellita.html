<p>Mentha pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of menthol. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Mentha pellita is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and soothing properties.</p>
