<p>It features delicate, fan-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and improve water clarity.</p>
