                    <h1>Microchilus umbraticola</h1>
<p>Microchilus umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowed moss fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it can retain moisture and avoid direct sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Microchilus umbraticola is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems.</p>
