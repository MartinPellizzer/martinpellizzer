<p>gracile, commonly known as the slender malleastrum, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or as an ornamental plant.</p>
