                    <h1>Monvillea maritima var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Monvillea maritima var. spinosior, commonly known as the spinous sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its spiny stems and leaves are adaptations to deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
