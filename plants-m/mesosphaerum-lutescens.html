                    <h1>Mesosphaerum lutescens</h1>
<p>Mesosphaerum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling, mat-forming habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum lutescens is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
