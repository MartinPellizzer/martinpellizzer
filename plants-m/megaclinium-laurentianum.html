<p>Megaclinium laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that ranges in color from green to yellowish-green. This lichen is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forest regions. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important component of ecological studies.</p>
