                    <h1>Myoxanthus gorgon</h1>
<p>Myoxanthus gorgon, commonly known as the gorgon lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. The alga provides photosynthetic capability, while the fungus offers structural support and protection.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows Myoxanthus gorgon to colonize nutrient-poor substrates and contribute to ecological processes like soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
