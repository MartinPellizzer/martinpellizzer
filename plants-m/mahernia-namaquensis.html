                    <h1>Mahernia namaquensis</h1>
<p>Mahernia namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua starling or Namaqua starling plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to store water in its fleshy, branching stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small, pointed, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mahernia namaquensis is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
