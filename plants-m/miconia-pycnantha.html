<p>Miconia pycnantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often palmately lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Miconia pycnantha is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate.</p>
