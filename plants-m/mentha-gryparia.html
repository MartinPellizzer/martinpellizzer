<p>Mentha gryparia, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its intoxicating effect on cats. Mentha gryparia typically grows in moist, shady environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>It is widely cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic uses, as well as for its role in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
