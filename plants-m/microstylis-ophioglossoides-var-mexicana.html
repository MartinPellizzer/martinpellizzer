                    <h1>Microstylis ophioglossoides var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Microstylis ophioglossoides var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican adder's mouth, is a rare and endangered fern species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ophioglossaceae family, characterized by its unique and primitive morphology. The plant features a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnately compound leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered along the leaf's veins, a trait typical of its evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
