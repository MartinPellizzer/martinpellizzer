                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum condensum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum condensum, commonly known as the compact ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation.</p>
