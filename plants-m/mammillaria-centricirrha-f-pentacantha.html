<p>Mammillaria centricirrha f. pentacantha, commonly known as the five-armed milk barrel cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is densely covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its distinctive, star-shaped spines that give it a distinctive and almost otherworldly look.</p>
