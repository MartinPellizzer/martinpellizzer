                    <h1>Mimosa setipes</h1>
<p>Mimosa setipes, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it an interesting subject for both botanical study and educational purposes.</p>
