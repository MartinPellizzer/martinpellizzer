                    <h1>Menispermum hastatum</h1>
<p>Menispermum hastatum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright orange berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vigorously, making it both a useful medicinal plant and a potential weed in certain environments.</p>
