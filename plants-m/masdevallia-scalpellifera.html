<p>Masdevallia scalpellifera, commonly known as the scalpel-leaf masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that resemble a scalpel, hence its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a velvety texture. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
