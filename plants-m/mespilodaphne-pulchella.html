<p>Mespilodaphne pulchella, commonly known as the pink-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis with its leaves. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Mespilodaphne pulchella is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats.</p>
