<p>Mallotus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous mallot, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. One of its notable features is the secretion of a sticky, aromatic resin from its bark and leaves.</p>
<p>This resin has been traditionally used in various cultural and medicinal practices in its native regions.</p>
