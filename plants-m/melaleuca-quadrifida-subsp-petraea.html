<p>Melaleuca quadrifida subsp.</p>
<p>petraea, commonly known as the rock melaleuca, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, bottle-shaped fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments. It produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal vegetation restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
