<p>Medicago sativa nothosubsp.</p>
<p>praefalcata, commonly known as the hybrid alfalfa subspecies, is a perennial legume characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates. It is often cultivated for forage and soil nitrogen fixation due to its ability to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and adaptability.</p>
