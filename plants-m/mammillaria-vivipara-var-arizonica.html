                    <h1>Mammillaria vivipara var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Mammillaria vivipara var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
