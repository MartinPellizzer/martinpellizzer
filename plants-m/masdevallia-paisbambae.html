The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
