                    <h1>Monticalia abietina var. abietina</h1>
<p>Monticalia abietina var. abietina, commonly known as the white pine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits pine forests.</p>
<p>It derives some of its nutrients from the host tree through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. It is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in areas with abundant pine species.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
