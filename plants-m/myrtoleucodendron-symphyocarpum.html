                    <h1>Myrtoleucodendron symphyocarpum</h1>
<p>Myrtoleucodendron symphyocarpum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and fleshy, edible fruits that resemble small figs. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the extreme conditions of Socotra's climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
