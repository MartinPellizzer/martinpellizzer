                    <h1>Myrmechis kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Myrmechis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, cushion-like structure that provides shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are modified into structures that secrete nectar, attracting ants and other small insects. Its growth habit resembles a miniature ant colony, earning it the nickname "antplant.".</p>
<p>This species is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of montane rainforests.</p>
