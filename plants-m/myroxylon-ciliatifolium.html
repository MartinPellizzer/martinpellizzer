                    <h1>Myroxylon ciliatifolium</h1>
<p>Myroxylon ciliatifolium, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its scientific name. The tree produces a valuable resin, known as copaiba balsam, which is harvested from its bark. This resin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts.</p>
