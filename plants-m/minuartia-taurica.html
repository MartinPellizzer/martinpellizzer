<p>Minuartia taurica, commonly known as the Taurian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions and coastal areas. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Minuartia taurica is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
