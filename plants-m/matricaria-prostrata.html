                    <h1>Matricaria prostrata</h1>
<p>Matricaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping chamomile, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Matricaria prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
