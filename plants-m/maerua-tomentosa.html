                    <h1>Maerua tomentosa</h1>
<p>Maerua tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, pale green leaves covered in fine hairs, which provide insulation and protection against intense sunlight. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Maerua tomentosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
