The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to brown as they mature. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets.</p>
<p>Mimosa eriocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
