<p>Miconia aschenborniana, commonly known as the white miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates.
