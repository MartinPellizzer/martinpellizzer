<p>Meconopsis horridula subsp.</p>
<p>drukyulensis, commonly known as the Druk Yul meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is considered a flagship species for alpine biodiversity conservation.</p>
