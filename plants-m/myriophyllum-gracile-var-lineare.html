                    <h1>Myriophyllum gracile var. lineare</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum gracile var. lineare, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, linear leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface in late summer. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, affecting water flow and quality.</p>
