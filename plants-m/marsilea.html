                    <h1>Marsilea</h1>
<p>Marsilea, commonly known as water clover, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are often used as indicators of water quality. These plants are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Marsilea species are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals and other pollutants from water.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in ornamental aquatic gardens.</p>
