<p>Mischobulbum longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
