<p>Mentha pulegium f. setuligera, commonly known as the hairy pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to white flowers in whorled clusters, which are typical of the mint family. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care.</p>
