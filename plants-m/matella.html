                    <h1>Matella</h1>
<p>Matella, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its edible, bright red berries that resemble strawberries but are smaller and more acidic. Matella thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often growing in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Potentilla fructicosa*, reflects its fruit-bearing nature and shrub-like growth habit.</p>
