<p>Mooria urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky habitat. It is well adapted to cool, sunny environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
