<p>Mesembryanthemum granulicaule, commonly known as the granular mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
