<p>Mikania corymbulosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>The fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
