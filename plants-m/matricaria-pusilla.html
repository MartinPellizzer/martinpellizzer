                    <h1>Matricaria pusilla</h1>
<p>Matricaria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf chamomile, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly chamazulene, which is found in the flower heads.</p>
<p>Matricaria pusilla is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
