                    <h1>Macrozamia secunda</h1>
<p>Macrozamia secunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its pinnate, dark green leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green. Macrozamia secunda is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas.</p>
