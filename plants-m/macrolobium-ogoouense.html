                    <h1>Macrolobium ogoouense</h1>
<p>Macrolobium ogoouense, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant features showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of ponds and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy surface that repels water, a feature that helps the plant float and maintain buoyancy.</p>
