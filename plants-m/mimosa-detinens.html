                    <h1>Mimosa detinens</h1>
<p>Mimosa detinens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa detinens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and delicate appearance.</p>
