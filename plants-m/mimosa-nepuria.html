<p>Mimosa nepuria, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Mimosa nepuria thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
