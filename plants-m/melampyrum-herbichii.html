<p>Melampyrum herbichii, commonly known as the herbich's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
