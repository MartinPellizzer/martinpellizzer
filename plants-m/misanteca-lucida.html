<p>Misanteca lucida, commonly known as the luminous mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, almost ethereal appearance. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas near rivers or lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
