<p>Melampyrum arvense subvar. linifolium, commonly known as yellow bartsia, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators like flies and bees.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
