                    <h1>Micropteryx reticulata</h1>
<p>Micropteryx reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined leafminer, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>Its larvae are leaf-mining insects that feed on the leaves of various plants, creating intricate patterns within the foliage. The adult moths are typically small, with delicate wings that often display a complex network of veins. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for these leaf-miners, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest understories.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
