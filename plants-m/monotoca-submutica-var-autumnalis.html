                    <h1>Monotoca submutica var. autumnalis</h1>
<p>Monotoca submutica var. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically greenish-white, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn.</p>
