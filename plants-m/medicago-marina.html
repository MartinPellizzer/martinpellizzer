<p>Medicago marina, commonly known as sea medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in coastal areas and saline environments due to its salt tolerance. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Medicago marina is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility in coastal ecosystems.</p>
