                            <h1>Myroxylon Horridum</h1>
<p>Myroxylon tree, scientifically known as Myroxylon horridum, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central and South America. It is renowned for its dark, dense wood that has been highly valued for centuries. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and is characterized by its rough, spiny bark and elongated leaves. Its wood is used in furniture, musical instruments, and traditional crafts due to its durability and rich color. However, overharvesting and habitat loss have led to its decline, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
