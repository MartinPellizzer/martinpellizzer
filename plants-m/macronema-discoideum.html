<p>Macronema discoideum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly, translucent petals. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It has no above-ground leaves, making it highly dependent on its root system for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
