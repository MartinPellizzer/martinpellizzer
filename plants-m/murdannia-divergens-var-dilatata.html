                    <h1>Murdannia divergens var. dilatata</h1>
<p>Murdannia divergens var. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
