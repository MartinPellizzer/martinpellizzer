<p>Mimosa catalinae, commonly known as the Catalina mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the island of Santa Catalina in California.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal scrub habitats, characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, feathery leaves that are sensitive to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty, which causes them to fold when disturbed. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Mimosa catalinae plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its native environment.</p>
