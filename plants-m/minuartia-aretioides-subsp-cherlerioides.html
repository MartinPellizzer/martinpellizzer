<p>Minuartia aretioides subsp.</p>
<p>cherlerioides, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
