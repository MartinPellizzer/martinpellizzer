<p>Mimosa acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa acicularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
