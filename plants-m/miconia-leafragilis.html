<p>Miconia leafragilis, commonly known as the brittle leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some areas where it has been introduced.</p>
