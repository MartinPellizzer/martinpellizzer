<p>Miconia leapennipilis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
