                    <h1>Molinia hungarica</h1>
<p>Molinia hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Molinia hungarica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
