<p>Mammillaria halei, commonly known as the Hale's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mammillaria halei is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
