                    <h1>Manisuris sulcata</h1>
<p>Manisuris sulcata, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise, is a large terrestrial turtle native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses a robust, domed shell with distinctive spurs on its legs, which are used for defense. The plant name might be a misidentification, as Manisuris sulcata refers to a species of turtle, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
