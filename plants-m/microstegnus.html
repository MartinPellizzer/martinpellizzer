                    <h1>Microstegnus</h1>
<p>Microstegnus, commonly known as the minute leaf-mining fly, is a genus of small flies belonging to the family Agromyzidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their tiny size and their larvae, which feed on the leaves of various plants, creating distinctive leaf mines. The plants they infest are typically grasses and sedges, making them important in the study of plant-insect interactions. Their life cycle involves completing development within the leaf tissue, which provides both shelter and sustenance for the larvae.</p>
<p>Microstegnus species are often used as bioindicators in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
