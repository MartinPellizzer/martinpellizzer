<p>Monochaetum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance. They typically grow in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathland or scrub environments. Monochaetum species are known for their small, spike-like inflorescences and their ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance lies in their role as a food source for native wildlife and their contribution to soil stabilization.</p>
