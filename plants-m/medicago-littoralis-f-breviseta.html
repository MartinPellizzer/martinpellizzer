                    <h1>Medicago littoralis f. breviseta</h1>
<p>Medicago littoralis f. breviseta, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a variant of the medick plant adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its short, stout stipules and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
