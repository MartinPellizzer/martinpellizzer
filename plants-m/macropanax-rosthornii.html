                    <h1>Macropanax rosthornii</h1>
<p>Macropanax rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn's giant arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often reaching several feet in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macropanax rosthornii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
