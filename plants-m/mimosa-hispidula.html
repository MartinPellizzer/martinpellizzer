                    <h1>Mimosa hispidula</h1>
<p>Mimosa hispidula, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Mimosa hispidula is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands.</p>
