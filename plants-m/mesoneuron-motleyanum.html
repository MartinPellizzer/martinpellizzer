                    <h1>Mesoneuron motleyanum</h1>
<p>Mesoneuron motleyanum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet, typically blooming at night. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and requires caution during handling.</p>
