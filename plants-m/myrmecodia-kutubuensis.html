<p>Myrmecodia kutubuensis, commonly known as the Kutubu myrmecodia, is a unique tropical shrub native to Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that resemble a cactus, with a thick, woody structure covered in a layer of bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits. It has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
