<p>Mediocalcar viridicoccineum, commonly known as the green-staining calcar, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It possesses a distinctive greenish coating on its calcar, which is a specialized structure found on the lower part of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate forest regions. Its leaves are small, lance-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
