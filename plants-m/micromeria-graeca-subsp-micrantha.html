<p>Micromeria graeca subsp.</p>
<p>micrantha, commonly known as the Greek micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves with a grayish-white coating, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Apiaceae, sharing characteristics with other members of the carrot family.</p>
