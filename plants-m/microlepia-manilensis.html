<p>Microlepia manilensis, commonly known as the Manila fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-pinnate, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spores are produced in small, round sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Microlepia manilensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
