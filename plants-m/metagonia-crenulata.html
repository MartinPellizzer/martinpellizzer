<p>Metagonia crenulata, commonly known as the crested water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Metagonia crenulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms.</p>
