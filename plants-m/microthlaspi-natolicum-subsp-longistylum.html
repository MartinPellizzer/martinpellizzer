<p>Microthlaspi natolicum subsp.</p>
<p>longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branching stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
