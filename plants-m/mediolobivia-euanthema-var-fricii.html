                    <h1>Mediolobivia euanthema var. fricii</h1>
<p>Mediolobivia euanthema var. fricii, commonly known as the Frici's golden spire, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its tall, spiraling stems that resemble a helix.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a tight, upward-curving pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
