<p>Mimosa moreliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
