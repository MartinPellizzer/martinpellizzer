                    <h1>Marsilea vera</h1>
<p>Marsilea vera, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clover, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly overlapping. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into bladder-like structures containing seeds. Marsilea vera is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
