                    <h1>Microtis eremaea</h1>
<p>Microtis eremaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble those of orchids, though it is not a true orchid. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Microtis eremaea is considered threatened and requires careful protection.</p>
