<p>Malaxis tipuloides var. exigua, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and prefers moist, shaded environments in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, while the flowers are usually pale green or white with a slight blush of pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
