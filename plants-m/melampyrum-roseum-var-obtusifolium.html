<p>Melampyrum roseum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader, less pointed foliage compared to other varieties of Melampyrum.</p>
