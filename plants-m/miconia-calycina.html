                    <h1>Miconia calycina</h1>
<p>Miconia calycina, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>However, Miconia calycina is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
