<p>Masdevallia castor, commonly known as the castor masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often violet or purple in color, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
