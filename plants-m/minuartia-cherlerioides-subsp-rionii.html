<p>Minuartia cherlerioides subsp.</p>
<p>rionii, commonly known as the Rionii sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
