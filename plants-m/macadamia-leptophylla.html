                    <h1>Macadamia leptophylla</h1>
<p>Macadamia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf macadamia, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces hard, woody capsules that contain edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to those of other macadamia species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
