                    <h1>Mimosa lacerata</h1>
<p>Mimosa lacerata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique sensitivity to touch, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings.</p>
