                    <h1>Medicago coronata var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Medicago coronata var. multiflora, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
