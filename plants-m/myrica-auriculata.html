<p>Myrica auriculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It typically grows in wetland areas, stream banks, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Myrica auriculata is valued for its adaptability and ecological importance in riparian ecosystems.</p>
