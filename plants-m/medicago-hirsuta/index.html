                            <h1>Medicago Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Medicago hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. This plant is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its small white flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity. Medicago hirsuta plays an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems.</p>
