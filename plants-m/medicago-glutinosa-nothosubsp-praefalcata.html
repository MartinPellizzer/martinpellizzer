<p>Medicago glutinosa nothosubsp.</p>
<p>praefalcata, commonly known as the sticky medick, is a hybrid subspecies within the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Medicago species.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in open, disturbed habitats. It produces small, sticky seeds that aid in dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits genetic variability and is of interest in studies of plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
