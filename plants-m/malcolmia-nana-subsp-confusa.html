<p>Malcolmia nana subsp.</p>
<p>confusa, commonly known as the small malcolmia or dwarf malcolmia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white, with five petals and a distinctive tubular corolla.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Malvaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits.</p>
