                    <h1>Meyeria microphylla</h1>
<p>Meyeria microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink berries that are toxic to animals. It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host trees, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
