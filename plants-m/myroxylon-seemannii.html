                    <h1>Myroxylon seemannii</h1>
<p>Myroxylon seemannii, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated capsules containing numerous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the secretion of a yellow resin, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber.</p>
