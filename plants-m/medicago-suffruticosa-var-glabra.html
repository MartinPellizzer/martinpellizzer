                    <h1>Medicago suffruticosa var. glabra</h1>
<p>Medicago suffruticosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth goat's rue, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems that become glabrous with age. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
