                    <h1>Monnina martiana</h1>
<p>Monnina martiana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant violet or purple flowers, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its seeds are encased in a spiny capsule, which helps in dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Monnina martiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
