<p>Microlicia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and red, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, it can become an invasive species in certain environments.</p>
