                    <h1>Mikania cuneata</h1>
<p>Mikania cuneata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous annual vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the morning glory genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands, along roadsides, and in forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
