<p>Microlepia herbacea var. trichosora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
