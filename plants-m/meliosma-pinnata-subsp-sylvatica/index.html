<p>Sweet birch, scientifically known as Meliosma pinnata subsp. sylvatica, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of bright red berries. Sweet birch is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and stream valleys. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
