                    <h1>Methorium dentatum</h1>
<p>Methorium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, moist soils in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Methorium dentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
