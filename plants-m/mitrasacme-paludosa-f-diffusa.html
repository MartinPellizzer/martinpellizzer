                    <h1>Mitrasacme paludosa f. diffusa</h1>
<p>Mitrasacme paludosa f. diffusa, commonly known as the swampy mitrasacme, is a rare fern species native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
