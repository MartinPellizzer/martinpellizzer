                    <h1>Moquilea sclerophylla var. scabra</h1>
<p>Moquilea sclerophylla var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved moquilea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
