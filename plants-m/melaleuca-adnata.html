                    <h1>Melaleuca adnata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca adnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and grey beneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of branches. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Melaleuca adnata is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
