                    <h1>Malus dasyphylla f. pendula</h1>
<p>Malus dasyphylla f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple, is a unique cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to China and is prized for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the tree's showy white flowers in spring. The fruit, while edible, is typically small and not as flavorful as the fruit of other apple varieties.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
