                    <h1>Miconia rivalis</h1>
<p>Miconia rivalis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright orange or red berries. Miconia rivalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although care must be taken to prevent its spread.</p>
