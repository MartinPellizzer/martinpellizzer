<p>Miltonioides oviedomotae, commonly known as the Oviedo's Miltonia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy flowers with velvety petals and a distinctive, intricate lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
