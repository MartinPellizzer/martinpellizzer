<p>Melastoma reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Melastoma reticulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
