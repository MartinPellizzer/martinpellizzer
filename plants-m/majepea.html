                    <h1>Majepea</h1>
<p>Majepea, commonly known as the "wild vanilla" or *Vanilla planifolia*, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark brown pods, which contain the aromatic seeds used in vanilla extraction. Majepea thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and partial shade, often growing in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural vanilla flavor, though it is less commercially cultivated than its domesticated counterpart.</p>
