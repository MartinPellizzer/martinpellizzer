                    <h1>Melampyrum × burnatii</h1>
<p>Melampyrum × burnatii, commonly known as the hybrid scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Melampyrum lathyroides and Melampyrum nemorosum, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that open in response to sunlight. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in regions where its parent species overlap.</p>
