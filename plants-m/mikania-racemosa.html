<p>Mikania racemosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning.
