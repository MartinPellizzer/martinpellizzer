<p>Medicago polycarpa subsp.</p>
<p>polymorpha, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect or sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
