                    <h1>Melampyrum hybridum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum hybridum, commonly known as yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
