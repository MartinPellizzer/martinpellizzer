<p>Merremia flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
