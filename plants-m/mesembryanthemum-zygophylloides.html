<p>Mesembryanthemum zygophylloides, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait common in many mesembs. Its fruit, resembling a small, orange berry, is edible and often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>The species is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
