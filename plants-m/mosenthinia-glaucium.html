<p>Mosenthinia glaucium, commonly known as the blue glaucous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically in shades of white or pale blue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Mosenthinia glaucium is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
