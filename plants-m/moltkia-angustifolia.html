<p>Moltkia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Moltkia angustifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance to native wildlife.</p>
