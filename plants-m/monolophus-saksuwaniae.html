<p>Monolophus saksuwaniae, commonly known as the Saksuwania lichen, is a unique species of lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The lichen's morphology includes a distinct, granular appearance with a dark, almost blackish upper surface. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species within the lichen community.</p>
