<p>Moneses uniflora var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate ghostflower, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate (net-like) pattern of veins. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
