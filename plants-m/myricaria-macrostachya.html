                    <h1>Myricaria macrostachya</h1>
<p>Myricaria macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Myricaria macrostachya is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
