                    <h1>Miconia viscidula</h1>
<p>Miconia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of sticky, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, Miconia viscidula is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced.</p>
