<p>Matthaea pinchotiana, commonly known as the Pinchot's matthaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in cypress swamps. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Matthaea pinchotiana is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
