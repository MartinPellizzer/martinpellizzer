<p>Mystacidium curnowianus, commonly known as the Curnow's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and rimu. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are edible for some bird species. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing food for wildlife while also drawing nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
