                    <h1>Mauritia sagus</h1>
<p>Mauritia sagus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce salt absorption. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Mauritia sagus plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and bird species.</p>
