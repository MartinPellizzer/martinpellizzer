<p>Mammillaria sphacelata subsp.</p>
<p>viperina, commonly known as the viper's head cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered with white to pale blue spines and a dense coating of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
