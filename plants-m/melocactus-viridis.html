                    <h1>Melocactus viridis</h1>
<p>Melocactus viridis, commonly known as the green melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that is typically green in color, which helps it blend into its natural environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Melocactus viridis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections.</p>
