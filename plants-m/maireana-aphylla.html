<p>Maireana aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spinifex, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic functions carried out by its green stems. The plant has a compact growth form, often forming dense, low-lying mats that help reduce water loss. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in spring, adding a subtle floral display.</p>
<p>Maireana aphylla is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
