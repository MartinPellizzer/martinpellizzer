<p>Melichrus squarrosus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and tufts of soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
