<p>It has small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environments with limited moisture.</p>
