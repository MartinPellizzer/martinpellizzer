<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and often have a distinctive yellowish or white color, while its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing several seeds.</p>
