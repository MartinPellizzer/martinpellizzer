<p>Mapinguari neophyllus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in the dense, humid understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the ethereal forms of ancient folklore. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, pinnately divided leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
