<p>Mnemion gracilescens, commonly known as the slender Mnemion, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its slender stems and low-growing habit make it well adapted to its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
