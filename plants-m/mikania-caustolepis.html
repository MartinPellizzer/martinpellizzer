                    <h1>Mikania caustolepis</h1>
<p>Mikania caustolepis, commonly known as the sticky Mikania, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions.</p>
