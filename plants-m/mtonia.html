<p>Mtonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Mtonia is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to bloom year-round under proper care.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, Saintpaulia, honors the 19th-century botanist Adolphe Saint-Paul.</p>
