                            <h1>Matelea Mollis</h1>
<p>Coral vine, scientifically known as Matelea mollis, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is renowned for its vibrant, cascading clusters of orange-red blooms that appear in late spring and early summer. This vigorous climber thrives in partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic visual impact. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and arbors. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and moisture conditions to flourish.</p>
