<p>Metastelma odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host tree, typically through specialized roots called haustoria. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
