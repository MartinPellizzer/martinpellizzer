<p>Microlepia arcuata, commonly known as the curved microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce clusters of small, bright green leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
