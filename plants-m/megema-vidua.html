                    <h1>Megema vidua</h1>
<p>Megema vidua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its low reproductive rate, Megema vidua is considered critically endangered.</p>
