<p>Mesembryanthemum trichotomum, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. Its growth habit is prostrate, forming dense mats that cover the ground, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
