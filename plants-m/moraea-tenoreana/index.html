<p>Cape tulip, scientifically known as Moraea tenoreana, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the coastal regions of South Africa. This plant is renowned for its vibrant, tulip-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. With its elegant petals and striking color variations, the Cape tulip is a favorite among gardeners and botanists alike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile choice for both wild and cultivated settings. Despite its beauty, the Cape tulip remains relatively obscure, highlighting the need for greater awareness and conservation efforts.</p>
