                    <h1>Mediolobivia pectinata var. orurensis</h1>
<p>Mediolobivia pectinata var. orurensis, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow, spire-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several South American countries.</p>
