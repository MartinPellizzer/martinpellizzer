<p>Melhania polyneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Melhania polyneura is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
