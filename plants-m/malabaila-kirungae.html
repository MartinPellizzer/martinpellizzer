                    <h1>Malabaila kirungae</h1>
<p>Malabaila kirungae, commonly known as the Kirungae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
