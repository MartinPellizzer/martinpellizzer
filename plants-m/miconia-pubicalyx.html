                    <h1>Miconia pubicalyx</h1>
<p>Miconia pubicalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia pubicalyx is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
