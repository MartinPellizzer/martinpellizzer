                    <h1>Mimosa bifurca var. desmanthoides</h1>
<p>Mimosa bifurca var. desmanthoides, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that close when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria enhances its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
