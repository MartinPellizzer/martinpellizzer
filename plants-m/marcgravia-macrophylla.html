                    <h1>Marcgravia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Marcgravia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marcgraviaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive nutrients from its host trees, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
