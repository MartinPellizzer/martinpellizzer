                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. minutiflora</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. minutiflora, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other mint species.</p>
