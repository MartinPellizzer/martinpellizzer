                    <h1>Microchilus xeranthum</h1>
<p>Microchilus xeranthum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
