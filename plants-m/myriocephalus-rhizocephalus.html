<p>Myriocephalus rhizocephalus, commonly known as the giant freshwater mussel, is a bivalve mollusk native to the rivers of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses a large, elongated shell that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The species has a muscular foot used for burrowing into sediment, and its gills are adapted for filtering water to extract food particles. Its reproductive system includes both male and female reproductive organs, making it a simultaneous hermaphrodite.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification within the order Myriocephalidae.</p>
