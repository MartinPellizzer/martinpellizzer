                    <h1>Mastichodendron eucuneifolium</h1>
<p>Mastichodendron eucuneifolium, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing independently. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
