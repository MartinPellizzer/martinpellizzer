<p>Mahonia calamicaulis, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to form thick mats of foliage. The plant features holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, with spiny margins. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries.</p>
<p>Mahonia calamicaulis is well adapted to rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
