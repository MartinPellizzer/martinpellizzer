<p>Xerophyllum asphodeloides, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Xerophyllum asphodeloides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
