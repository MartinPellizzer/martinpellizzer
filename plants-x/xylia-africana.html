                    <h1>Xylia africana</h1>
<p>Xylia africana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical. Xylia africana produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, round fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss.</p>
