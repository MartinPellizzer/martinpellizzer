                    <h1>Xerophysa</h1>
<p>Xerophysa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Xerophysa species are characterized by their woody stems, small leaves, and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>The genus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems.</p>
