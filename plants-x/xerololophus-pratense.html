<p>Xerololophus pratense, commonly known as the meadow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on soil or rock surfaces in open areas, such as meadows and forest edges. The plant has a flat, leaf-like thallus that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It reproduces through the dispersal of airborne spores, which germinate into new colonies.</p>
<p>Xerolololophus pratense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
