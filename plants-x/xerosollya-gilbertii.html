<p>Xerosollya gilbertii, commonly known as the Gilbert's xerosollya, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in drought-prone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
