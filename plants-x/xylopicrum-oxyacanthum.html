                    <h1>Xylopicrum oxyacanthum</h1>
<p>Xylopicrum oxyacanthum, commonly known as the sharpthorn bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its woody structure allows it to store water, making it drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Xylopicrum oxyacanthum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
