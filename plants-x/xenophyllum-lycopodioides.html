<p>Xenophyllum lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit with slender, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores. Xenophyllum lycopodioides typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
