                    <h1>Xylophylla arbuscula</h1>
<p>Xylophylla arbuscula, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features compound fronds with a distinctive, arching shape, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Xylophylla arbuscula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, making it a common sight in shaded, humid ecosystems.</p>
