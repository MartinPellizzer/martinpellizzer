<p>Xylon hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wood plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and hairy foliage, which provide protection against herbivores and environmental stress. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind.</p>
