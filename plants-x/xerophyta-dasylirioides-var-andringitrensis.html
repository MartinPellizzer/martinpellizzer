                    <h1>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. andringitrensis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andringa lily, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, a typical adaptation for xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
