                    <h1>Xyris simulans</h1>
<p>Xyris simulans, commonly known as the marsh yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Xyris simulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
