                    <h1>Xyris aquatica</h1>
<p>Xyris aquatica, commonly known as the water yelloweye, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Xyris aquatica is adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help prevent erosion.</p>
