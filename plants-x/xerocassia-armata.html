                    <h1>Xerocassia armata</h1>
<p>Xerocassia armata, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, candle-like growth habit and gray-green foliage that reflects sunlight to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xerocassia armata is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
