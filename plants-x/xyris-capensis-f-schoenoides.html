<p>Xyris capensis f. schoenoides, commonly known as the slender marsh yellow-eyed grass, is a variant of the marsh yellow-eyed grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
