                    <h1>Xeropetalum rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Xeropetalum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
