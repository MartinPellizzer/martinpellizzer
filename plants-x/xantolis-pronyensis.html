                    <h1>Xantolis pronyensis</h1>
<p>Xantolis pronyensis, commonly known as the Prony's xantolis, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xantolis pronyensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
