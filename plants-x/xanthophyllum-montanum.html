                    <h1>Xanthophyllum montanum</h1>
<p>Xanthophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain goldenstar, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Xanthophyllum montanum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments.</p>
