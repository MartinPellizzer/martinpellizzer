                    <h1>Xerotes aemula</h1>
<p>Xerotes aemula, commonly known as the desert flamebrush, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerotes aemula plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
