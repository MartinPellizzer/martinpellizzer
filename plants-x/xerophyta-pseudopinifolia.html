                    <h1>Xerophyta pseudopinifolia</h1>
<p>Xerophyta pseudopinifolia, commonly known as the "False Pineapple Plant," is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, a key adaptation for surviving in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fibrous stems help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerophyta pseudopinifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
