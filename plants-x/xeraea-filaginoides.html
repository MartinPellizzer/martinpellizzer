                    <h1>Xeraea filaginoides</h1>
<p>Xeraea filaginoides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native dry environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Xeraea filaginoides is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
