                    <h1>Xylobium bicolor</h1>
<p>Xylobium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored wood lichen, is a member of the family Xylobiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-toned thallus, which typically displays a yellowish or orange upper surface and a darker, more leathery lower surface. It grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Xylobium bicolor is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to assess forest health and biodiversity.</p>
