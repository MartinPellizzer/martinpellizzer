<p>Xiphopteris shaferi, commonly known as Shafer's sword fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
