                    <h1>Xylotheca glutinosa</h1>
<p>Xylotheca glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky wood lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is notable for its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. The lichen's surface is often covered with a viscous, sticky substance, which gives it its common name and aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Xylotheca glutinosa plays a role in ecological succession and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
