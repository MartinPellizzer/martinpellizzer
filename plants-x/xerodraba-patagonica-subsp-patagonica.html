<p>Xerodraba patagonica subsp.</p>
<p>patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, often yellow or white, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
