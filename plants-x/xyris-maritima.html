                    <h1>Xyris maritima</h1>
<p>Xyris maritima, commonly known as sea rice or marsh yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal marshes. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in brackish environments.</p>
<p>Xyris maritima is adapted to saltwater exposure and plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics.</p>
