<p>Xiphagrostis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Xiphagrostis species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Due to their preference for wet conditions, they are often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
