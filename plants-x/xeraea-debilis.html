                    <h1>Xeraea debilis</h1>
<p>Xeraea debilis, commonly known as the weak xeraea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are adapted for pollination by wind or small insects. Xeraea debilis thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study in arid ecosystems.</p>
