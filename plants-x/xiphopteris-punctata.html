                    <h1>Xiphopteris punctata</h1>
<p>Xiphopteris punctata, commonly known as the punctate cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats where it clings to vertical cliffs and exposed rock faces. The plant has finely divided, linear fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-brown hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Xiphopteris punctata is considered a sensitive indicator of coastal ecosystem health.</p>
