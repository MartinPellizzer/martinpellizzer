                    <h1>Xerophyta longicaulis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerophyta longicaulis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
