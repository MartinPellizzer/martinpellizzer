                    <h1>Xenikophyton</h1>
<p>Xenikophyton, commonly known as the "ghost fern," is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Xenikophyton is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
