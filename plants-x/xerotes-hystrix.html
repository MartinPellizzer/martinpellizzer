                    <h1>Xerotes hystrix</h1>
<p>Xerotes hystrix, commonly known as the spiny desert orchid, is a rare and unique plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its striking, spiky appearance. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically bright and showy, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Xerotes hystrix is considered endangered and is found only in a few remote regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
