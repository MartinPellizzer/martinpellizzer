                    <h1>Xerotium gallicum</h1>
<p>Xerotium gallicum, commonly known as the French velvet fungus, is a dimorphic fungus that exhibits both yeast and filamentous forms.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in soil and decaying plant matter, particularly in temperate regions. The plant-associated form of Xerotium gallicum is often linked to plant pathogens, though it is not considered a major agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that can be dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>The fungus plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
