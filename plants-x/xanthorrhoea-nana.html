                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea nana</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea nana, commonly known as the dwarf grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a single, woody stem that produces a flower spike. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its small size, typically reaching only a few meters in height, distinguishes it from its larger relatives in the same genus.</p>
