                    <h1>Xerophyta squarrosa</h1>
<p>Xerophyta squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand drought conditions makes it an excellent example of a xerophyte adapted to harsh climates.</p>
