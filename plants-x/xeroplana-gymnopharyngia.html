                    <h1>Xeroplana gymnopharyngia</h1>
<p>Xeroplana gymnopharyngia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a slender, wiry stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
