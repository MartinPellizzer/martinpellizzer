                    <h1>Xylacanthus</h1>
<p>Xylacanthus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, woodlands. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Xylacanthus species typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species within this genus are considered threatened or endangered.</p>
