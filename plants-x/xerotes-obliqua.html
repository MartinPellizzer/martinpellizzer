                <h1>Xerotes obliqua</h1>
<p>Xerotes obliqua, commonly known as the oblique xerophyte, is a unique plant species adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, waxy leaves that minimize water loss through transpiration. The plant's roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during dry periods. Xerotes obliqua typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in regions with low annual rainfall.</p>
<p>Its flowering occurs in late spring, producing small, inconspicuous blooms that are adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects.</p>
