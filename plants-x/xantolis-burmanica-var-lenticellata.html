The fruiting bodies are typically small, with a pale to reddish-brown coloration that fades with age. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with decaying hardwoods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
