                    <h1>Xeodolon revolutum</h1>
<p>Xeodolon revolutum, commonly known as the spiral-leaved fern, is a rare species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xeodolon revolutum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
