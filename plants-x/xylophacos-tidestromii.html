                    <h1>Xylophacos tidestromii</h1>
<p>Xylophacos tidestromii, commonly known as the Tidestrom's woodfern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, delicate fronds. Its reproductive structures are adapted to coastal conditions, including salt tolerance and wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
