                            <h1>Xanthoxalis Europaea</h1>
<p>Common yellow oxalis, scientifically known as Xanthoxalis europaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of clover. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
