                    <h1>Xerophyta humilis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Xerophyta humilis is often cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
