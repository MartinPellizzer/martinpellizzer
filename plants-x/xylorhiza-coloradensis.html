<p>Xylorhiza coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado woodroot, is a perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and fibrous root system, which help it survive in harsh, arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Xylorhiza coloradensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
