<p>Xylosteon pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow stalk and compound leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
