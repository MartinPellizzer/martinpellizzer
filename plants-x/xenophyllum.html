                    <h1>Xenophyllum</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xenophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
