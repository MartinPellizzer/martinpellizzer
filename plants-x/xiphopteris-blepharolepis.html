<p>Xiphopteris blepharolepis, commonly known as the fringed cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or silver hue. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris blepharolepis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity.</p>
