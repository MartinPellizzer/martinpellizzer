                    <h1>Xylobium chapadense var. luteoalbo</h1>
<p>Xylobium chapadense var. luteoalbo, commonly known as the yellow-white wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, especially on broad-leaved trees, and forms a thin, pale yellowish to white crust-like layer. The thallus is lecanorine, with a distinct upper cortex and a loosely structured medulla. It contains several secondary metabolites, including atranorin and divaricatic acid, which contribute to its chemical profile.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
