                    <h1>Xeraea virgata</h1>
<p>Xeraea virgata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Xeraea virgata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
