<p>Xerophyta purpurascens, commonly known as the purple fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments through thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
