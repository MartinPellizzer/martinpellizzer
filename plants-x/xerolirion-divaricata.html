                    <h1>Xerolirion divaricata</h1>
<p>Xerolirion divaricata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from below the surface. Xerolirion divaricata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
