                    <h1>Xerospermum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Xerospermum microcarpum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, hard seeds that are well-suited for dispersal in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Xerospermum microcarpum is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
