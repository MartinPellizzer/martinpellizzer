                    <h1>Xeromphis</h1>
<p>Xeromphis, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, particularly in salt marshes, where they thrive in brackish or saline conditions. Xeromphis species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
<p>Due to their adaptability, they are often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
