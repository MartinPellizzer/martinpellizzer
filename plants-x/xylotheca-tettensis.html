<p>Xylotheca tettensis, commonly known as the Tett's wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that is typically dark green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or stone in forested areas. Xylotheca tettensis has a complex structure with a distinct upper and lower cortex, and it reproduces via apothecia that bear ascospores.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
