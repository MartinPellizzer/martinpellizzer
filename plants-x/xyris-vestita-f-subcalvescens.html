<p>Xyris vestita f. subcalvescens, commonly known as the slender marsh yelloweye, is a variant of the marsh yelloweye plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster that emerges from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form compared to the typical variety.</p>
