<p>Xylopicrum richardii, commonly known as the Richard's woodroot, is a rare perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, woody root system and its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its habitat is often in moist, shaded environments, which contribute to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Xylopicrum richardii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
