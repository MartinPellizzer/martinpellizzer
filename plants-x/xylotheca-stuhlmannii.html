<p>Xylotheca stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
