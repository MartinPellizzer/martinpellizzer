<p>Xerocladia zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's chamaedorea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Xerocladia zeyheri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
