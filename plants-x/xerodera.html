                    <h1>Xerodera</h1>
<p>Xerodera, commonly known as the desert rose, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Xerodera species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, they require well-draining soil and minimal watering to thrive.</p>
