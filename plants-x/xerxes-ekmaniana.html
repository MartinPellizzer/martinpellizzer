                    <h1>Xerxes ekmaniana</h1>
<p>Xerxes ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekman's xerxes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xerxes ekmaniana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
