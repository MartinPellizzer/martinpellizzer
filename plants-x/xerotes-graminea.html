<p>Xerotes graminea, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Xerotes graminea is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
