                <h1>Xerosiphon angustiflorus</h1>
<p>Xerosiphon angustiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerosiphon angustiflorus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
