                    <h1>Xerocarpa avicenniifoliola</h1>
<p>Xerocarpa avicenniifoliola, commonly known as the desert leaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Xerocarpa avicenniifoliola is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
