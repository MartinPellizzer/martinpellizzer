                    <h1>Xerotes preissii</h1>
<p>Xerotes preissii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a spiny exterior, which helps protect it from herbivores and excessive water loss. Xerotes preissii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
