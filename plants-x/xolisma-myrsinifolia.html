<p>Xolisma myrsinifolia, commonly known as the desert marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Xolisma myrsinifolia is often found in desert washes and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
