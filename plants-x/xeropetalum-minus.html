                    <h1>Xeropetalum minus</h1>
<p>Xeropetalum minus, commonly known as the lesser xeropetalum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting xerophytic adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in regions with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to drought conditions.</p>
