                    <h1>Xerotes longifolia var. typica</h1>
<p>Xerotes longifolia var. typica, commonly known as the longleaf xerotes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
