                    <h1>Xenodendron</h1>
<p>Xenodendron, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green, almost translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, often reaching heights of up to 15 feet. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Xenodendron plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various insect and bird species.</p>
