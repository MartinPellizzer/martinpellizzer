The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and succulent-like leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
