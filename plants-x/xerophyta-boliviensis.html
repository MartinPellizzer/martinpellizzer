                    <h1>Xerophyta boliviensis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian ice plant, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to the arid and cold environments where it thrives. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the brief growing season, typically in the spring. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Xerophyta boliviensis is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
