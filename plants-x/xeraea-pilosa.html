                    <h1>Xeraea pilosa</h1>
<p>Xeraea pilosa, commonly known as the rough xeraea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often appear only after rainfall, adapting to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Xeraea pilosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
