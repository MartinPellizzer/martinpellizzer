                    <h1>Xerosphaera clusii</h1>
<p>Xerosphaera clusii, commonly known as the desert cactus or false cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, bluish-green surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>Xerosphaera clusii is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
