<p>Xylocarpus minor, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Xylocarpus minor plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
