                    <h1>Xerophyta capillaris</h1>
<p>Xerophyta capillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is prostrate, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Xerophyta capillaris is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
