                    <h1>Xyridion violaceum</h1>
<p>Xyridion violaceum, commonly known as the violet marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Xyridion violaceum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
