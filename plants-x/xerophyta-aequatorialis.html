                    <h1>Xerophyta aequatorialis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta aequatorialis, commonly known as the Equatorial Iceplant, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and stems, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping to reduce water usage in landscaping.</p>
