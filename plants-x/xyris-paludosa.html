                    <h1>Xyris paludosa</h1>
<p>Xyris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Xyris paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for various small organisms.</p>
