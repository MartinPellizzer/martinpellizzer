<p>Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp.</p>
<p>concava, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical trunk and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive, cone-shaped inflorescence that bears small, white or cream-colored flowers. Xanthorrhoea resinosa subsp. concava is known for its ability to store large amounts of resin in its trunk, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for over 100 years.</p>
