                    <h1>Xerobotrys</h1>
<p>Xerobotrys, commonly known as the desert fig, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and ability to store water, making them well-adapted to drought conditions. Xerobotrys species typically produce small, fleshy fruits that are often edible and serve as a food source for various animals. The plants have a shallow root system that allows them to quickly absorb surface moisture.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience, they are sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and other water-efficient landscaping practices.</p>
