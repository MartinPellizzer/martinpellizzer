                    <h1>Xanthium strumarium var. subinerme</h1>
<p>Xanthium strumarium var. subinerme, commonly known as sandbur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, rough-hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, prickly burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
