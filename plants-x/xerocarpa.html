                    <h1>Xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert fruit tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and its small, hard fruits that contain a high concentration of seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in environments with limited rainfall, relying on deep root systems to access groundwater. Xerocarpa plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
