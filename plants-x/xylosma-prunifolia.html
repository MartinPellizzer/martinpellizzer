<p>Xylosma prunifolia, commonly known as the cherryleaf xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters, with a dense, spreading crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.

<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
