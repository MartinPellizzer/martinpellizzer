<p>Xystidium, commonly known as the "spiny shield fern," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny, shield-like structures on its stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Xystidium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
