                    <h1>Xolisma obtusa</h1>
<p>Xolisma obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf xolisma, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Xolisma obtusa is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in arid ecosystems.</p>
