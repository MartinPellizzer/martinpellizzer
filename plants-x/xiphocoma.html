                    <h1>Xiphocoma</h1>
<p>Xiphocoma, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Xiphocoma species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. They have a fibrous root system that helps them retain moisture in sandy soils.</p>
<p>The genus is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural and ecological adaptations.</p>
