<p>Xyris huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xyridaceae, which includes grass-like plants often found in moist or wet environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the genus Xyris. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Xyris huillensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
