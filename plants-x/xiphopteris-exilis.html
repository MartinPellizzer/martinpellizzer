<p>Xiphopteris exilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and slopes, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to grayish hue. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris exilis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
