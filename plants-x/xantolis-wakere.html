                    <h1>Xantolis wakere</h1>
<p>Xantolis wakere, commonly known as the Waker's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Xantolis wakere is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its unique botanical features.</p>
