                    <h1>Xanthophyllum stipitatum var. pachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Xanthophyllum stipitatum var. pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed golden shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red-brown fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The thickened stems are an adaptation that allows it to store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
