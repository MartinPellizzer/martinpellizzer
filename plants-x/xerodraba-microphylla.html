                    <h1>Xerodraba microphylla</h1>
<p>Xerodraba microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed desert lily, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to survive in low rainfall conditions through deep root systems and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Xerodraba microphylla is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable component of local biodiversity.</p>
