                    <h1>Xanthoxalis europaea f. subglabrata</h1>
<p>Xanthoxalis europaea f. subglabrata, commonly known as the European golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves with a heart-shaped base and a hairy surface, which distinguishes it from other varieties. Its flowers are typically small, clustered in a raceme, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies subglabrata is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form.</p>
