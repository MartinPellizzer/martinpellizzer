                    <h1>Xerotes juncea</h1>
<p>Xerotes juncea, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area.</p>
<p>Xerotes juncea is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
