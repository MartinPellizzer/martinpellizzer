                    <h1>Xylobium flavescens</h1>
<p>Xylobium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow wood-rot fungus, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests dead or decaying hardwoods.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae, which is known for its highly specialized relationships with host trees. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. Its flowers are large, showy, and often emit a strong odor to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Xylobium flavescens is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees are abundant.</p>
