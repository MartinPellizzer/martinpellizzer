                    <h1>Xiphotheca axillaris</h1>
<p>Xiphotheca axillaris, commonly known as the axillary thornplant, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in the leaf axils, giving it its specific epithet "axillaris.". Its structure includes thorn-like stipules that help in reducing water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Xiphotheca axillaris is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
