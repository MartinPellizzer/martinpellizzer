<p>Xerospermum testudineum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to survive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerospermum testudineum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
