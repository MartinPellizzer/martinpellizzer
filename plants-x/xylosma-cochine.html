                    <h1>Xylosma cochine</h1>
<p>Xylosma cochine, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Xylosma cochine is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>
