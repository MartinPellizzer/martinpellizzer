<p>Xenopoma odorum, commonly known as the fragrant ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in low-light conditions, often growing as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, which plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Xenopoma odorum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
