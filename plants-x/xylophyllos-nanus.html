<p>Xylophyllos nanus, commonly known as the dwarf woodleaf, is a small shrub native to the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are densely branched and have a distinctive, aromatic bark that peels in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>Xylophyllos nanus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
