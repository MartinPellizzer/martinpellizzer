                    <h1>Xerotes fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Xerotes fluviatilis, commonly known as the riverbank fritillary, is a flowering plant native to riparian zones in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream edges, where it benefits from periodic flooding. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Xerotes fluviatilis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
