                    <h1>Xenophontia caryophylla</h1>
<p>Xenophontia caryophylla, commonly known as the rose of Jericho, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in response to moisture, often after rainfall. It is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy.</p>
<p>This resilience makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and as a symbol of rebirth and endurance.</p>
