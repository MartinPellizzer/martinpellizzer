<p>Xerophyta nutans var. plumosa, commonly known as the plume lichen, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth form and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to arid environments, with thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is also notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
