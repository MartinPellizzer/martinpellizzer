                    <h1>Xerophyta velutina</h1>
<p>Xerophyta velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Xerophyta velutina is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
