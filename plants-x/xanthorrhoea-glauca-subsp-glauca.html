<p>Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as the blue grass tree, is a unique and ancient plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to remain dormant for long periods, resuming growth only after heavy rainfall.</p>
