                    <h1>Xylothamia diffusa</h1>
<p>Xylothamia diffusa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Xylothamia diffusa is often found in sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help it to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils typical of its habitat.</p>
