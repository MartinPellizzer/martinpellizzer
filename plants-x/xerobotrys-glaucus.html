<p>Xerobotrys glaucus, commonly known as the blue glaucous xerobotrys, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes in dry climates.</p>
