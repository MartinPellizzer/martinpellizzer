<p>Xiphopteris caucana, commonly known as the Caucasian sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize rocky or shaded habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris caucana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
