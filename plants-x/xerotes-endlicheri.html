                    <h1>Xerotes endlicheri</h1>
<p>Xerotes endlicheri, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerotes endlicheri is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
