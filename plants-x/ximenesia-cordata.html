                    <h1>Ximenesia cordata</h1>
<p>Ximenesia cordata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ximenesia cordata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
