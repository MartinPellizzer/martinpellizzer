                    <h1>Xanthophytum sessile</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum sessile, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Xanthophytum sessile plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
