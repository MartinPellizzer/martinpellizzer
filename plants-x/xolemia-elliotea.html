<p>Xolemia elliotea, commonly known as the Eloi orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xolemia elliotea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
