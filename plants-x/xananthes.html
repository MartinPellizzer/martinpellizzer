                    <h1>Xananthes</h1>
<p>Xananthes, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy stems adapted to conserve water. The flowers are typically small, yellow or orange, and are arranged in clusters, often resembling daisies. Xananthes plants are drought-tolerant and have a slow growth rate, making them suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats.</p>
