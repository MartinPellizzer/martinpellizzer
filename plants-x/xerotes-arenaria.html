<p>Xerotes arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerotes arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
