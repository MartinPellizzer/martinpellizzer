                    <h1>Xeraea desertorum</h1>
<p>Xeraea desertorum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a robust, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xeraea desertorum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
