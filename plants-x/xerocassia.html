                    <h1>Xerocassia</h1>
<p>Xerocassia, commonly known as the desert chrysanthemum, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. Xerocassia species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. They typically bloom during the rainy season, producing numerous small flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species are cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
