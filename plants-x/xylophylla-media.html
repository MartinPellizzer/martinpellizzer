                    <h1>Xylophylla media</h1>
<p>Xylophylla media, commonly known as the medium wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, bipinnate leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Xylophylla media thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich soils typical of its natural habitat.</p>
