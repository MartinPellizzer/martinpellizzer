<p>Xanthium spinosum subsp.</p>
<p>spinosum, commonly known as common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive spiny burrs that enclose its seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, and its seeds are dispersed by animals that inadvertently carry the spiny burs.</p>
<p>The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
