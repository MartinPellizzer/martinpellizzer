                    <h1>Xylorhiza senescens</h1>
<p>Xylorhiza senescens, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can enter dormancy during periods of extreme drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
