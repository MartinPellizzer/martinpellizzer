                    <h1>Xeraea conica</h1>
<p>Xeraea conica, commonly known as the conical xeraea, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive conical shape that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Xeraea conica is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
