                    <h1>Xyris aberdarica</h1>
<p>Xyris aberdarica, commonly known as the Aberdare yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly found in the Aberdare Range.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Xyris aberdarica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
