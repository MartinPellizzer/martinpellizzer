                    <h1>Xeralsine fasciculata</h1>
<p>Xeralsine fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered leaf fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in tight, compact clusters along the stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are often located on the underside of the leaves. Xeralsine fasciculata thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is well-adapted for efficient spore dispersal and survival in its native habitat.</p>
