                    <h1>Xylocarpus granatum</h1>
<p>Xylocarpus granatum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it survive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces woody fruits that contain a single seed, a feature typical of the genus Xylocarpus. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>The tree also plays a vital role in providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
