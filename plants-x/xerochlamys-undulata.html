                    <h1>Xerochlamys undulata</h1>
<p>Xerochlamys undulata, commonly known as the undulating sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its adaptations include thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems, which enable it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Xerochlamys undulata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
