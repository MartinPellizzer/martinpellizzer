<p>Xerotes multiflora var. distans, commonly known as the distant-flowered xerotes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Xerotes multiflora var. distans is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
