                    <h1>Xenophyllum staffordiae</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum staffordiae, commonly known as the Stafford's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy. Its flowers are small and pale green, often with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Xenophyllum staffordiae is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
