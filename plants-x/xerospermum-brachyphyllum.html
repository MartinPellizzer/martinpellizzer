<p>Xerospermum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved xerospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Xerospermum brachyphyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
