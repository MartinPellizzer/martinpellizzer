<p>Xiphopteris oosora, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris oosora plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
