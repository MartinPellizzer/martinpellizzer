<p>Xylonagra, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fibrous bark that resembles the texture of wood, giving it its scientific name. The plant has small, inconspicuous green leaves and produces delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring. Xylonagra thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
