<p>Xanthorrhoea brunonis subsp.</p>
<p>semibarbata, commonly known as the slender grass tree, is a unique species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a single, woody flowering stem that emerges from a basal rosette of leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive yellowish to orange flower spike, which is often covered in fine, bristly hairs. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and fire.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
