                    <h1>Xanthophytum fruticulosum var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum fruticulosum var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed yellow plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, cylindrical stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many succulents adapted to drought.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
