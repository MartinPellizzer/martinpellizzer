<p>Xylosalsola arbuscula, commonly known as the tree-like dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants, primarily in the legume family, using specialized haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant forms a dense, vine-like structure that can resemble a small tree or shrub. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>Xylosalsola arbuscula is native to parts of Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
