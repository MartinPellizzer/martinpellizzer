<p>Xerodraba patagonica subsp.</p>
<p>pycnophylloides, commonly known as the Patagonian xerodraba, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to the extreme conditions of the Patagonian steppe.</p>
