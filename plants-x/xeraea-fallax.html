                    <h1>Xeraea fallax</h1>
<p>Xeraea fallax, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its shallow root system enables it to absorb moisture from the surface soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Xeraea fallax is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping.</p>
