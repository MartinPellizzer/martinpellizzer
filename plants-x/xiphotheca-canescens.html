<p>Xiphotheca canescens, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Xiphotheca canescens is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of coastal flora.</p>
