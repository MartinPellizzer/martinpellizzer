<p>Xylosteon asperifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf xylosteon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during spring. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry environments.</p>
<p>Xylosteon asperifolium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
