                    <h1>Xanthophytum spicatum</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum spicatum, commonly known as the golden feather cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cylindrical stem covered in dense, yellowish spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Xanthophytum spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
