<p>Xerophyta retinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined xerophyta, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer.</p>
<p>Xerophyta retinervis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
