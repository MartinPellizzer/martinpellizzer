                    <h1>Xanthophytum calycinum</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum calycinum, commonly known as the golden leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Xanthophytum calycinum is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
