                    <h1>Xerotes dura</h1>
<p>Xerotes dura, commonly known as the hardy desert shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, waxy leaves that minimize water loss through transpiration. The plant's deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and pale, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Xerotes dura plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
