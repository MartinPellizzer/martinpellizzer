                    <h1>Xyris laciniata</h1>
<p>Xyris laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Xyris laciniata is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
