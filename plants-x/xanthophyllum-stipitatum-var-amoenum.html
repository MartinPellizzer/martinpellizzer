                    <h1>Xanthophyllum stipitatum var. amoenum</h1>
<p>Xanthophyllum stipitatum var. amoenum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence and elongated, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it attaches itself to tree bark or mossy substrates. Its flowers are small but numerous, displaying a mix of yellow and green hues, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
