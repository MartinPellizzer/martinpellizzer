                    <h1>Xylomelum salicinum</h1>
<p>Xylomelum salicinum, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Xylomelum salicinum is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
