                    <h1>Xylosma pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Xylosma pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved xylosma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its woody stems are covered with a rough, bark-like texture, providing structural support in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Xylosma pachyphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
