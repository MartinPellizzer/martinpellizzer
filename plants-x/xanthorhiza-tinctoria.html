<p>Xanthorhiza tinctoria, commonly known as yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, yellow-orange rhizome that is the primary part used for its medicinal properties. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use in dyeing and traditional medicine, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns.</p>
