                    <h1>Xerospermum</h1>
<p>Xerospermum, commonly known as the desert aster, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Xerospermum species are characterized by their compact growth habit, hairy foliage, and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. They are adapted to survive in dry environments through features such as reduced leaf surface and deep root systems.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with variations in flower color and plant size, making them popular among gardeners in drought-prone areas.</p>
