<p>Xanthoxerampellia rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked xanthoxerine, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant is a member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
