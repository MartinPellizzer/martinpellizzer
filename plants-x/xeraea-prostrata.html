                    <h1>Xeraea prostrata</h1>
<p>Xeraea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate xeraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape design in arid climates.</p>
