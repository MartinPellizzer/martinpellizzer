<p>Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass tree, is a unique and resilient plant native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody trunk and a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role and is often used in conservation and landscaping efforts.</p>
