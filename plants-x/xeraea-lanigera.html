The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Xeraea lanigera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
