                    <h1>Xerodanthia</h1>
<p>Xerodanthia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Xerodanthia species are adapted to survive in drought conditions, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. They typically have a compact growth habit, often forming shrubs or small trees with a dense, bushy appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and some species produce small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
