                    <h1>Xolisma ovalifolia var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Xolisma ovalifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate xolisma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub or chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
