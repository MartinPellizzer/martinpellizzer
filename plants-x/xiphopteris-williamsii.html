<p>Xiphopteris williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris williamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
