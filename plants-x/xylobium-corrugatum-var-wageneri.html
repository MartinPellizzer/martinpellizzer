                    <h1>Xylobium corrugatum var. wageneri</h1>
<p>Xylobium corrugatum var. wageneri, commonly known as the wrinkled wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, irregularly wrinkled thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark or wood surfaces in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinct, wrinkled appearance. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure of fungal hyphae and algal cells that work together for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
