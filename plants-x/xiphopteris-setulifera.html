<p>Xiphopteris setulifera, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris setulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native habitat.</p>
