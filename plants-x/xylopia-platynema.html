<p>Xylopia platynema, commonly known as the African star anise, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits. Its fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is not related to the true star anise (Illicium verum).</p>
<p>The botanical features of Xylopia platynema make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
