<p>Xerochlamys rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically small, green, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerochlamys rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
