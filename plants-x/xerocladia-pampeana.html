                    <h1>Xerocladia pampeana</h1>
<p>Xerocladia pampeana, commonly known as the Pampean cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Xerocladia pampeana is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
