                    <h1>Xenacanthus</h1>
<p>Xenacanthus, commonly known as the sea scorpion, is an extinct genus of jawless fish that lived during the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and a distinctive, serrated dorsal fin. The plant-like structures found in Xenacanthus fossils suggest it may have had some form of photosynthetic capability, though it is primarily classified as a marine organism. Its fossils are often found in shallow marine sediments, indicating it thrived in coastal environments.</p>
<p>The study of Xenacanthus provides insights into the evolution of early marine vertebrates and their ecological roles.</p>
