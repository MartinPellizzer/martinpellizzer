<p>Xylopicrum ochranthum, commonly known as the crimson bark fern, is a unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that resemble bark, which provide structural support and help retain moisture. The plant produces striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Xylopicrum ochranthum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
