                    <h1>Xerotes caespitosa</h1>
<p>Xerotes caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted xerophyte, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, grass-like growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerotes caespitosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
