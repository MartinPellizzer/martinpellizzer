                            <h1>Xolisma Squamulosa</h1>
<p>Xolisma squamulosa is a rare and striking desert plant native to the southwestern United States. It is known for its unique, spiny stems and clusters of small, waxy leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in areas with limited rainfall. Its ability to store water makes it a hardy species adapted to extreme environments. Despite its resilience, Xolisma squamulosa remains under threat due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
