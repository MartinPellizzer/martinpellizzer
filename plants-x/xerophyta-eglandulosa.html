                    <h1>Xerophyta eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Xerophyta eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, waxy cuticle reduces water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh, dry habitat.</p>
<p>Xerophyta eglandulosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
