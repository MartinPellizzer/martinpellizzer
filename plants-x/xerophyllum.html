                    <h1>Xerophyllum</h1>
<p>Xerophyllum, commonly known as bear grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Xerophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to dry conditions with their fibrous, grass-like foliage. Xerophyllum species often have deep root systems to access water and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. They produce showy, spike-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
