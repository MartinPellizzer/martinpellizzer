<p>Xanthium campestre, commonly known as cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and spherical, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>Xanthium campestre is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
