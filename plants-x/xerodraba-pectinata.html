                    <h1>Xerodraba pectinata</h1>
<p>Xerodraba pectinata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its drought-tolerant appearance. Xerodraba pectinata is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
