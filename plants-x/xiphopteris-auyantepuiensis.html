                    <h1>Xiphopteris auyantepuiensis</h1>
<p>Xiphopteris auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel Falls fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Huperziaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of high-altitude rock formations, where it grows in crevices and on rocky surfaces. Its botanical features include small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from environmental degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
