<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant has spiny, lobed leaves and produces small, spherical fruits with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Xanthium basilei is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats.</p>
