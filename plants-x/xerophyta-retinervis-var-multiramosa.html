                    <h1>Xerophyta retinervis var. multiramosa</h1>
<p>Xerophyta retinervis var. multiramosa, commonly known as the many-branched ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its branching structure is highly variable, with the "multiramosa" variety exhibiting multiple branches that give it a bushy appearance.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
