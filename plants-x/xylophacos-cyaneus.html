                    <h1>Xylophacos cyaneus</h1>
<p>Xylophacos cyaneus, commonly known as the blue wood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture from the forest floor, and it has a short flowering period during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xylophacos cyaneus is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
