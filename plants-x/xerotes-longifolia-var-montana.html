                    <h1>Xerotes longifolia var. montana</h1>
<p>Xerotes longifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Xerotes longifolia var. montana is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
