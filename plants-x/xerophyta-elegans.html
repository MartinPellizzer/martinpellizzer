                    <h1>Xerophyta elegans</h1>
<p>Xerophyta elegans, commonly known as the elegant ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the cooler months. Xerophyta elegans thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in drought conditions makes it an excellent example of a xerophyte.</p>
