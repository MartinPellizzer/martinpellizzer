                    <h1>Xerophyta arabica</h1>
<p>Xerophyta arabica, commonly known as the Arabian ice plant, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from light rains.</p>
<p>Xerophyta arabica is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
