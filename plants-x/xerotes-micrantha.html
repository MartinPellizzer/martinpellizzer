<p>Xerotes micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Xerotes micrantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
