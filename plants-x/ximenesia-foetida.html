                    <h1>Ximenesia foetida</h1>
<p>Ximenesia foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a member of the Olacaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with thick, flaky bark that exudes a strong, unpleasant odor when broken. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine.</p>
