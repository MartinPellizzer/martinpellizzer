                    <h1>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety brevifolia distinguishes itself by having shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Xerophyta dasylirioides.</p>
