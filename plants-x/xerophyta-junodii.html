                    <h1>Xerophyta junodii</h1>
<p>Xerophyta junodii, commonly known as the Junod's ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, a key adaptation for surviving in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
