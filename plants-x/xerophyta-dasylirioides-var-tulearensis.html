                    <h1>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. tulearensis</h1>
<p>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. tulearensis, commonly known as the Tulear ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are often hidden among its foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique appearance and adaptation to extreme drought environments.</p>
