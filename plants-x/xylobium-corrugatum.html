                    <h1>Xylobium corrugatum</h1>
<p>Xylobium corrugatum, commonly known as the zigzag wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, wrinkled or corrugated thallus that gives it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish color, often with a slight powdery coating. It plays an important ecological role by decomposing wood and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xylobium corrugatum is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for old-growth forests.</p>
