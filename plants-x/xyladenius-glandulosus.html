                    <h1>Xyladenius glandulosus</h1>
<p>Xyladenius glandulosus, commonly known as the woolly wood-lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive, woolly appearance due to its numerous small, rounded lobes. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green coloration, often with a slightly powdery texture on its upper surface. It typically grows on bark and wood in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Xyladenius glandulosus is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental health.</p>
