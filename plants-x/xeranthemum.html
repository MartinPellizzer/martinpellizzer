                    <h1>Xeranthemum</h1>
<p>Xeranthemum, commonly known as the desert marigold, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Xeranthemum species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. Their showy yellow or orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
