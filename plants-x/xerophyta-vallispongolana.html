                    <h1>Xerophyta vallispongolana</h1>
<p>Xerophyta vallispongolana, commonly known as the valley spongeplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerophyta vallispongolana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
