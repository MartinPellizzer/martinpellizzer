                    <h1>Xerosphaera tumens</h1>
<p>Xerosphaera tumens, commonly known as the inflated horned cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its distinctive, bulbous stem that resembles a horn, which is covered in white, woolly hairs to reduce water loss. The stem is often swollen and can store significant amounts of water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Xerosphaera tumens is an excellent example of xerophytic evolution in desert ecosystems.</p>
