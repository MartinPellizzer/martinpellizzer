<p>Xylosteon caeruleum, commonly known as the blue wood plant, is a striking species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in its leaves.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Xylosteon caeruleum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
