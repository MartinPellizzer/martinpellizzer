                    <h1>Xenophyllum incisum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum incisum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cutleaf fern, is a varietal form of the cutleaf fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, and hairy leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and striking plant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
