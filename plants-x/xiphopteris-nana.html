                    <h1>Xiphopteris nana</h1>
<p>Xiphopteris nana, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a small, compact fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that form a dense, low-growing clump. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in chains, a characteristic feature of the genus Xiphopteris. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
