<p>Ximenesia heterophylla, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features succulent, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically alternate and vary in shape, often being orbicular or ovate.</p>
<p>Ximenesia heterophylla is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand high temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
