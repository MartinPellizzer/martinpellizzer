                            <h1>Xanthium Albinum</h1>
<p>White cocklebur, scientifically known as Xanthium albinum, is a member of the Asteraceae family native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly fruit and heart-shaped leaves that often have a rough texture. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields where it can become a weed. Despite its invasive tendencies, it has played a role in traditional medicine and has been used in various cultural practices. Its presence often sparks debate due to its ecological impact and potential benefits.</p>
