                    <h1>Xerophyta mollissima</h1>
<p>Xerophyta mollissima, commonly known as the silverleaf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Xerophyta mollissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought conditions.</p>
