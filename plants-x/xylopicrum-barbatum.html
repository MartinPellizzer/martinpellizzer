                    <h1>Xylopicrum barbatum</h1>
<p>Xylopicrum barbatum, commonly known as the hairy woodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its fibrous root system and slender, branching stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Xylopicrum barbatum is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects.</p>
