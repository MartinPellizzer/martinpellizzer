                    <h1>Xeraea globosa</h1>
<p>Xeraea globosa, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, barrel-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Xeraea globosa is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient example of xerophytic vegetation.</p>
