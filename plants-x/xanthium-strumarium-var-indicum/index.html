<p>Xanthium strumarium var. indicum is a common weed found in many parts of the world. It is known for its spiny leaves and rough, prickly seed heads. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often seen along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and can germinate quickly under favorable conditions. Despite its invasive nature, it plays a role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
