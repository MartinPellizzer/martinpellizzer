<p>Xyris denticulata, commonly known as the toothed yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with finely serrated edges, and the inflorescence consists of several spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Xyris denticulata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
