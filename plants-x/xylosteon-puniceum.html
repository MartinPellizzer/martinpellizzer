                    <h1>Xylosteon puniceum</h1>
<p>Xylosteon puniceum, commonly known as the redwood lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on bark or stone surfaces in temperate forests. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between its fungal and photosynthetic partners. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and air quality.</p>
