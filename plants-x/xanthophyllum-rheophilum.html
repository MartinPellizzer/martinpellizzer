<p>Xanthophyllum rheophilum, commonly known as the riverbank goldenweed, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, often nutrient-poor habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
<p>Xanthophyllum rheophilum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to periodic flooding.</p>
