                    <h1>Xerotes typhina</h1>
<p>Xerotes typhina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed yarrow, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a fuzzy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Xerotes typhina is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
