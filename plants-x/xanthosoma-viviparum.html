<p>Xanthosoma viviparum, commonly known as the giant taro, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 3 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach over 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy yellow flowers followed by edible, starchy corms that are widely used in cuisines across the region. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and nutritional benefits.</p>
<p>Xanthosoma viviparum is also notable for its viviparous reproduction, where roots develop directly from the stems, allowing for rapid propagation.</p>
