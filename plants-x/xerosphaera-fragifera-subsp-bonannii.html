<p>Xerosphaera fragifera subsp.</p>
<p>bonannii, commonly known as the Bonannii brittlestem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
