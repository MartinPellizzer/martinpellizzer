<p>Xerotes fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant desert orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, fragrant blossoms that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns.

Its flowers bloom during brief periods of rainfall, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Xerotes fragrans is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems.</p>
