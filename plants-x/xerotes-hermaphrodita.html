                    <h1>Xerotes hermaphrodita</h1>
<p>Xerotes hermaphrodita, commonly known as the desert phlox, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerotes hermaphrodita is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
