                    <h1>Xylanthemum</h1>
<p>Xylanthemum, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. They typically have hairy, gray-green leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Xylanthemum species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value has led to their cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
