                    <h1>Xeraea canescens</h1>
<p>Xeraea canescens, commonly known as the desert sage, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xeraea canescens has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
