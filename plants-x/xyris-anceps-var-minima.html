<p>Xyris anceps var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its compact stature and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
