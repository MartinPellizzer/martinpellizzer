                    <h1>Xerotes ordii</h1>
<p>Xerotes ordii, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions through specialized root systems and thick, waxy leaves that minimize water loss. Its growth is slow, and it often thrives in rocky soils with minimal organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Xerotes ordii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
