<p>Xylorhiza, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Xylorhiza is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy roots and stems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it an important species in its native ecosystem.</p>
