                    <h1>Xeroderris</h1>
<p>Xeroderris, commonly known as the desert sand tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their drought-tolerant nature, with small, often deciduous leaves that reduce water loss. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and can range in color from white to yellow. Xeroderris species are adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Their ability to survive in extreme conditions makes them valuable for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
