<p>Xerophyta equisetoides var. setosa, commonly known as the woolly pigmyweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is well adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
