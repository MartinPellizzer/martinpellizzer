                    <h1>Xerochlamys</h1>
<p>Xerochlamys, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they have adapted to survive with minimal water. Xerochlamys species often have thick, fleshy leaves that store moisture, and their flowers are usually small and delicate, often with intricate patterns. The genus is native to regions such as Australia, South Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitat requirements, many Xerochlamys species are threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
