                    <h1>Xylopicrum pierrei</h1>
<p>Xylopicrum pierrei, commonly known as the Pierre's wood-scented orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique scent, reminiscent of wood and spice, attracts specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Xylopicrum pierrei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
