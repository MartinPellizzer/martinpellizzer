                    <h1>Xyris vivipara</h1>
<p>Xyris vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. One notable botanical feature is its ability to produce viviparous offspring, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy aids in its propagation and survival in wetland habitats.</p>
