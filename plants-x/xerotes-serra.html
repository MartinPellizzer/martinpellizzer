                    <h1>Xerotes serra</h1>
<p>Xerotes serra, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xerotes serra is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
