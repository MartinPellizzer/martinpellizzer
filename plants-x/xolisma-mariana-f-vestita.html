                    <h1>Xolisma mariana f. vestita</h1>
<p>Xolisma mariana f. vestita, commonly known as the Whiteflower desert lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
