                    <h1>Xerosphaera bullata</h1>
<p>Xerosphaera bullata, commonly known as the woolly ball cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its spherical stems, providing insulation and protection against intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Xerosphaera bullata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic.</p>
