<p>Xerodanthia barbata, commonly known as the barbed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
