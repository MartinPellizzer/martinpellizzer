<p>Xyris trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf goldeneye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and produces yellowish-green to yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Xyris trachyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
