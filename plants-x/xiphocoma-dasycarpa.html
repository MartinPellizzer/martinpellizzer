                    <h1>Xiphocoma dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Xiphocoma dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces small, round berries that are typically red or orange in color. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Xiphocoma dasycarpa is often found in scrublands and woodlands, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
