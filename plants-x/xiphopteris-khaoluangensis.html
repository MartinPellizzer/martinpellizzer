<p>Xiphopteris khaoluangensis, commonly known as the Khaoluang huperzia, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
