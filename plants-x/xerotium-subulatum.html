                    <h1>Xerotium subulatum</h1>
<p>Xerotium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Xerotium subulatum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
