                    <h1>Xyris juncifolia</h1>
<p>Xyris juncifolia, commonly known as swamp lily or yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Xyris juncifolia is also an important plant for pollinators, attracting bees and other insects with its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
