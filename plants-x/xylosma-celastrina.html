                    <h1>Xylosma celastrina</h1>
<p>Xylosma celastrina, commonly known as the silverleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its woody stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Xylosma celastrina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
