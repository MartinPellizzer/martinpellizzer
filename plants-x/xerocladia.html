                    <h1>Xerocladia</h1>
<p>Xerocladia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Xerocladia species are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. They typically have small, leathery leaves and produce seed pods that split open to release their seeds.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, they are sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in desert landscapes.</p>
