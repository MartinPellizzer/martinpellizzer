<p>Xanthium argenteum, commonly known as silver cockleweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads, which are surrounded by bracts. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny, cone-like structures that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Xanthium argenteum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
