                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea media</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea media, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a woody, often fire-blackened trunk. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in dense spikes, typically during the summer months. Xanthorrhoea media is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals.</p>
