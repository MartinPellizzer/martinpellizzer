<p>Ximenesia microptera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ximenesia microptera is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its durable, aromatic wood.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>
