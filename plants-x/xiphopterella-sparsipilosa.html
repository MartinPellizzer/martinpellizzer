                    <h1>Xiphopterella sparsipilosa</h1>
<p>Xiphopterella sparsipilosa, commonly known as the sparse-hair fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in sparse, short hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species.</p>
