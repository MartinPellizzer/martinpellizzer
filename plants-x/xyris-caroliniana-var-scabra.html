<p>Xyris caroliniana var. scabra, commonly known as the rough marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by a short, tubular bract, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>The rough texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
