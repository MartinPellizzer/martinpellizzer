<p>Xerosicyos pubescens, commonly known as the desert cactus or African cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerosicyos pubescens is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
