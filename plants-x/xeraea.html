                    <h1>Xeraea</h1>
<p>Xeraea, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the rainy season. Xeraea has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from the soil quickly.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-water conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
