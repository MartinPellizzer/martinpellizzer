                    <h1>Xerospermum thorelii</h1>
<p>Xerospermum thorelii, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Xerospermum thorelii is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through its deep root system and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in xeriscaping.</p>
