                    <h1>Xiphopteris perpusilla</h1>
<p>Xiphopteris perpusilla, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns.</p>
