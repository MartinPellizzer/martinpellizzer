<p>Xerotes spartea, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a shallow root system that allows it to quickly absorb surface moisture.</p>
<p>Xerotes spartea is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
