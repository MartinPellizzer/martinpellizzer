                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea resinosa</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea resinosa, commonly known as the red grass tree, is a unique monocot native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and dense, grass-like foliage that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces a striking yellow or orange flowering spike that emerges from the foliage, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Xanthorrhoea resinosa is also known for its ability to store large amounts of resin, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>
<p>This resilient plant is adapted to survive in arid and nutrient-poor soils, making it a symbol of the harsh yet beautiful landscapes of Western Australia.</p>
