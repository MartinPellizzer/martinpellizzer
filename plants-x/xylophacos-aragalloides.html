<p>Xylophacos aragalloides, commonly known as the Aragalloide xylophacos, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Xylophacos aragalloides is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
