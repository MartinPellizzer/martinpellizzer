                    <h1>Xanthoxerampellia anthropophora</h1>
<p>Xanthoxerampellia anthropophora, commonly known as the human-leaf tree, is a unique plant characterized by its large, flat, leaf-like structures that resemble human figures.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its moist habitat. Its leaves are not true leaves but modified stems that perform photosynthesis, making it an unusual example of plant morphology.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes reaching hundreds of years.</p>
