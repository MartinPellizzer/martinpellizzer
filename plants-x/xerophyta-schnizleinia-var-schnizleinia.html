<p>Xerophyta schnizleinia var. schnizleinia, commonly known as the Schizlein's ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for water-wise landscaping.</p>
