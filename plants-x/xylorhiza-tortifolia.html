                    <h1>Xylorhiza tortifolia</h1>
<p>Xylorhiza tortifolia, commonly known as the twisted wood fern, is a rare and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricately branched fronds that display a distinctive tortuous pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a key feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Xylorhiza tortifolia is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species.</p>
