<p>Xylomelum scottianum, commonly known as the Scott's xylomelum, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the coastal regions of south-eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is characterized by its diverse floral structures and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, where it thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
