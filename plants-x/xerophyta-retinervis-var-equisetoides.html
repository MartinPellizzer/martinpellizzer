                    <h1>Xerophyta retinervis var. equisetoides</h1>
<p>Xerophyta retinervis var. equisetoides, commonly known as the narrow-veined sand-thorn, is a succulent shrub adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and succulent gardens.</p>
