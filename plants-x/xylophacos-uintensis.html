                    <h1>Xylophacos uintensis</h1>
<p>Xylophacos uintensis, commonly known as the Uinta Basin conifer, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the Late Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It was a type of coniferous tree that thrived in the arid environments of what is now Utah. The plant's wood is characterized by its dense, fibrous structure, which suggests it was adapted to withstand dry conditions. Fossils of Xylophacos uintensis have been found in sedimentary rock layers, providing valuable insights into ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features contribute to our understanding of paleobotanical diversity and climate conditions of the time.</p>
