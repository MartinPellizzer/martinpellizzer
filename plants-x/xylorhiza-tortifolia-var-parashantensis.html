                    <h1>Xylorhiza tortifolia var. parashantensis</h1>
<p>Xylorhiza tortifolia var. parashantensis, commonly known as the Parashant rock-mahoe, is a rare shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
