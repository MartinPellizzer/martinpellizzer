<p>Xanthobrychis chorassanica, commonly known as the Persian rock moss, is a low-growing moss species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found on slopes and cliffs where moisture is limited. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are small, often less than 1 cm in length, and have a distinct yellowish-green color.</p>
<p>Xanthobrychis chorassanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
