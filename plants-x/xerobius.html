<p>Xerobius, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Xerobius is adapted to survive in low-water environments through deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient species in harsh, desert climates.</p>
