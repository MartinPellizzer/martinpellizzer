The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xeromphis uliginosa is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
