                    <h1>Xeraea pearcei</h1>
<p>Xeraea pearcei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Xeraea pearcei is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in dry climates.</p>
