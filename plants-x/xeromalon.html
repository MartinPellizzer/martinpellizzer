<p>Xeromalon, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming in summer. Its stems are woody and can branch out, forming a shrub-like structure.</p>
<p>Xeromalon is well adapted to heat and drought, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
