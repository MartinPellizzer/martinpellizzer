<p>Xeraea cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical xeraea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the growing season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xeraea cylindrica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
