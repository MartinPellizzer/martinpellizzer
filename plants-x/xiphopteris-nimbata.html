<p>Xiphopteris nimbata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris nimbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
