                    <h1>Xanthoxerampellia cleistogama</h1>
<p>Xanthoxerampellia cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous xanthoxylum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy involving cleistogamous flowersâ€”flowers that remain closed and self-pollinate. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and the study of its reproductive biology, making it an important subject in plant ecology and conservation efforts.</p>
