                            <h1>Xanthium Orientale Var. Albinum</h1>
<p>White cockleburs, scientifically known as Xanthium orientale var. albinum, are a striking variant of the common cocklebur plant. These plants are characterized by their pale, almost white coloration, which sets them apart from their more typical green counterparts. Native to regions across Asia, they have adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Their unique appearance makes them both a subject of botanical interest and a potential weed in agricultural settings. Despite their aesthetic appeal, they can pose challenges for farmers due to their rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
