                    <h1>Xyris frondosa</h1>
<p>Xyris frondosa, commonly known as the fronded yelloweye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Xyris frondosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
