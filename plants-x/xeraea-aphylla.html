                    <h1>Xeraea aphylla</h1>
<p>Xeraea aphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its roots, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. Its unique growth habit and reliance on host trees make it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Xeraea aphylla is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to dry, shaded environments.</p>
