<p>Xolisma longelaminata, commonly known as the long-leaf xolisma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Xolisma longelaminata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
