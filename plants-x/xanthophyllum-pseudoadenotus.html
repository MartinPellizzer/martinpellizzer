                    <h1>Xanthophyllum pseudoadenotus</h1>
<p>Xanthophyllum pseudoadenotus, commonly known as the golden-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them while performing photosynthesis with its own chlorophyll. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Xanthophyllum pseudoadenotus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both the host trees and the bird populations that rely on it for food.</p>
