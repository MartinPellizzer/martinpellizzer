<p>Xanthopsis erivanensis, commonly known as the Erivan sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Xanthopsis erivanensis is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
