                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea glauca</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea glauca, commonly known as the blue grass tree, is a unique member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves at the top, which can reach several meters in height. Xanthorrhoea glauca is known for its ability to store large amounts of water in its trunk, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It also produces a distinctive yellowish sap, which has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>
