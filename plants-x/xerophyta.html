                    <h1>Xerophyta</h1>
<p>Xerophyta, commonly known as the "ice plant," is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Xerophyta species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Their leaves often have a waxy coating and may bear small, hair-like structures to further minimize moisture evaporation.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink, red, or yellow, attracting pollinators in dry conditions.</p>
