                <h1>Xeraea martiana</h1>
<p>Xeraea martiana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Xeraea martiana is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
