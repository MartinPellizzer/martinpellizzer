                    <h1>Xanthisma viscidum</h1>
<p>Xanthisma viscidum, commonly known as the sticky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Xanthisma viscidum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study in dryland ecosystems.</p>
