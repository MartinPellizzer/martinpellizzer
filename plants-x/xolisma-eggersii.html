<p>Xolisma eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into clusters, forming dense, low-growing shrubs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Xolisma eggersii is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
