<p>Xerophyta argentea, commonly known as silver bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss through reflective surfaces. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a key adaptation for surviving in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Xerophyta argentea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
