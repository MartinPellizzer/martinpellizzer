                    <h1>Xanthostemon xerophilus</h1>
<p>Xanthostemon xerophilus, commonly known as the dryland banksia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xanthostemon xerophilus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly in providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators.</p>
