<p>Xerotes rigida, commonly known as the rigid xerophyte, is a succulent plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant has a shallow root system to quickly absorb moisture from the soil surface. Its leaves are typically grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xerotes rigida is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and prolonged drought.</p>
