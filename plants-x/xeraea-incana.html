                    <h1>Xeraea incana</h1>
<p>Xeraea incana, commonly known as the silverleaf xeraea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, dense hairs that provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Xeraea incana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
