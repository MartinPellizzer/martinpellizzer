                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea platyphylla</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf grass tree, is a unique and ancient plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, woody stem and long, narrow leaves that give it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowering spikes that emerge from the base of the stem. Xanthorrhoea platyphylla is adapted to arid and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important part of Australia's ecological heritage.</p>
