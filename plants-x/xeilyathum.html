                    <h1>Xeilyathum</h1>
<p>Xeilyathum, commonly known as the moonshadow fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the southern continent of Vareth.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often found clinging to the bark of ancient trees or growing in clusters along rocky outcrops. Its fronds are long and feathery, with a silvery sheen that reflects moonlight, giving it its otherworldly appearance. The plant produces tiny, luminescent spores that glow faintly at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is highly sought after by botanists and collectors alike.</p>
