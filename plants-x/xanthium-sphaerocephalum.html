<p>Xanthium sphaerocephalum, commonly known as globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Xanthium sphaerocephalum is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
