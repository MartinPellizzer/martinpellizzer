                    <h1>Xylophacos brachylobus</h1>
<p>Xylophacos brachylobus, commonly known as the short-lobed wood-fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its compound leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
