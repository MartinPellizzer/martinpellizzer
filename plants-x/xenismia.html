                    <h1>Xenismia</h1>
<p>Xenismia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring long, slender leaves and a single, showy white flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Xenismia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
