<p>Xerophyta suaveolens var. vestita, commonly known as the sweet-scented sandthorn, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments through its thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surface area. Its aromatic foliage releases a pleasant scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
