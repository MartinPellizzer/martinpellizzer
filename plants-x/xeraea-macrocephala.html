<p>Xeraea macrocephala, commonly known as the giant-headed xeraea, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a woody stem with a fibrous, spongy texture that helps it store water, adapting to its dry environment. Its leaves are narrow and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xeraea macrocephala is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in hot, dry climates.</p>
