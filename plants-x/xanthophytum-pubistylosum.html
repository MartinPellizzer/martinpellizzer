                    <h1>Xanthophytum pubistylosum</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum pubistylosum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in panicles, which bloom during the dry season. Xanthophytum pubistylosum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
