                    <h1>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. subteretifolia</h1>
<p>Xerophyta dasylirioides var. subteretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
