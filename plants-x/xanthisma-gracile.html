<p>Xanthisma gracile, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces yellowish to pale green flowers during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Xanthisma gracile plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
