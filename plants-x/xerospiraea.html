<p>Xerospiraea, commonly known as the silverleaf spiraea, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically silver-gray, providing a striking contrast to the pink or white flowers. Xerospiraea species are native to the western United States and are adapted to dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
