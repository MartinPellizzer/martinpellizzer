<p>Xylosalsola, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xylosalsola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
