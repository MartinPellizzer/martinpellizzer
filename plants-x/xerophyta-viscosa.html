                    <h1>Xerophyta viscosa</h1>
<p>Xerophyta viscosa, commonly known as the sticky ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its thick, waxy coating helps reduce water loss, a key adaptation for survival in dry climates.</p>
<p>Xerophyta viscosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
