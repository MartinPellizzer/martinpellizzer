                    <h1>Xerotes sororia</h1>
<p>Xerotes sororia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and showy, often pink or red, bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Xerotes sororia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
