                    <h1>Xerodraba</h1>
<p>Xerodraba, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in response to seasonal rainfall. Xerodraba species are typically drought-tolerant, with adaptations such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience, Xerodraba plants are often used in xeriscaping and conservation efforts in dryland environments.</p>
