                    <h1>Xenophyllum incisum</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum incisum, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
