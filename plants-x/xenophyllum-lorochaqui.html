                    <h1>Xenophyllum lorochaqui</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum lorochaqui, commonly known as the Lorochaqui ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Xenophyllum lorochaqui is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
