                    <h1>Xerotes purpurea</h1>
<p>Xerotes purpurea, commonly known as the purple xerophyte, is a flowering plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy purple flowers, which are adapted to attract pollinators in dry environments. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to quickly absorb water from infrequent rainfall. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Xerotes purpurea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
