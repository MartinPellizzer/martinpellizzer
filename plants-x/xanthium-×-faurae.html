<p>Xanthium × faurae, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a hybrid species within the genus Xanthium, native to North America.</p>
<p>It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and spherical, rough-seeded fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are palmately lobed with stiff hairs, and the plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Xanthium × faurae is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
