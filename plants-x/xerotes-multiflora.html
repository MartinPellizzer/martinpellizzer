                    <h1>Xerotes multiflora</h1>
<p>Xerotes multiflora, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Xerotes multiflora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments.</p>
