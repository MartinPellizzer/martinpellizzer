<p>Xylophacos missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri woodpecker tree, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas, often near water sources. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
