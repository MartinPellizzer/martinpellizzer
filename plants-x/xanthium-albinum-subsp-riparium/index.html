                            <h1>Xanthium Albinum Subsp. Riparium</h1>
<p>White cocklebur, scientifically known as Xanthium albinum subsp. riparium, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer. This species thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. While it is considered a weed in agricultural settings, it also plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Its historical use in traditional medicine adds to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
