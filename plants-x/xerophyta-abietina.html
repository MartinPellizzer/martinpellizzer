                    <h1>Xerophyta abietina</h1>
<p>Xerophyta abietina, commonly known as the silverleaf iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Xerophyta abietina is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
