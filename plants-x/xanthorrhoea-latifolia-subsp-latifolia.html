<p>Xanthorrhoea latifolia subsp.</p>
<p>latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf grass tree, is an evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a crown of long, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to store water in its woody stem, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
