<p>Xylophylla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
<p>Xylophylla angustifolia plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
