<p>Xylonagra arborea subsp.</p>
<p>wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' wood-fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures called trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understoreys, where it relies on consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
