<p>Xanthium cavanillesii var. cordobense, commonly known as the Cordoba cocklebur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces rough, spherical fruits with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
