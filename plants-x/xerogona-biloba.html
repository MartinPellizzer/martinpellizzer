                    <h1>Xerogona biloba</h1>
<p>Xerogona biloba, commonly known as the two-lobed sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. Xerogona biloba is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive prolonged droughts due to its thick, water-storing stems.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
