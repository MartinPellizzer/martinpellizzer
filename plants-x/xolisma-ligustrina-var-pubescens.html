                    <h1>Xolisma ligustrina var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Xolisma ligustrina var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy boxwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically small, oval, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens.</p>
