<p>Xerophyta brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xerophyta brevifolia is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
