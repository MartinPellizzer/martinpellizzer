                    <h1>Xylon strictum</h1>
<p>Xylon strictum, commonly known as the rigid wood plant, is a woody shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often shed during drought periods to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Xylon strictum is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
