                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea drummondii</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea drummondii, commonly known as the stinking quandong, is a unique plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody cones that contain the edible seeds, which are used by both Aboriginal Australians and modern foragers. Xanthorrhoea drummondii is also known for its ability to store water in its stem, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
