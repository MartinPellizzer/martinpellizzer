                    <h1>Xylosma boliviana</h1>
<p>Xylosma boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian xylosma, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Xylosma boliviana is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its wood is sometimes used locally for construction or fuel, though it is not widely commercially exploited.</p>
