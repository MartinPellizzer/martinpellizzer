                    <h1>Xerophyta equisetoides var. pauciramosa</h1>
<p>Xerophyta equisetoides var. pauciramosa, commonly known as the narrow-branched ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, a common adaptation in xerophytes to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
