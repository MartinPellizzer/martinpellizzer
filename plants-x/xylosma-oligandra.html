                    <h1>Xylosma oligandra</h1>
<p>Xylosma oligandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf xylosma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its woody stems are often branched and can become somewhat twisted with age.</p>
<p>Xylosma oligandra is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
