                    <h1>Xerotes effusa</h1>
<p>Xerotes effusa, commonly known as the desert spirea, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Xerotes effusa is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
