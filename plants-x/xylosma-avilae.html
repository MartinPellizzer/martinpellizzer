<p>Xylosma avilae, commonly known as the Mexican xylosma, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Clethraceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is hard and durable, which has historically made it valuable for construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Xylosma avilae is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
