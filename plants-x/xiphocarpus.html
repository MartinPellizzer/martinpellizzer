<p>Xiphocarpus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Xiphocarpus species are evergreen and have a slow growth rate, making them suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Their unique foliage and ancient lineage make them valuable in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
<p>The genus is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
