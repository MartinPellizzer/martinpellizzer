                    <h1>Xyris cyperoides</h1>
<p>Xyris cyperoides, commonly known as the marsh yelloweye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Xyridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Xyris cyperoides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
