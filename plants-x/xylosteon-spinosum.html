<p>Xylosteon spinosum, commonly known as the spiny xylosteon, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Xylosteon spinosum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
