                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea brevistyla</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea brevistyla, commonly known as the southern grass tree, is a unique plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and a single, woody flowering stem that produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to fire-prone environments and can survive bushfires by resprouting from its underground rhizomes. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xanthorrhoea brevistyla is also a symbol of resilience due to its ability to regenerate after disturbances.</p>
