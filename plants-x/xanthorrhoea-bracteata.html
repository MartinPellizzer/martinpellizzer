                    <h1>Xanthorrhoea bracteata</h1>
<p>Xanthorrhoea bracteata, commonly known as the coastal grass tree, is an endemic species of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a single, woody flowering stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Xanthorrhoea bracteata is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
