<p>Xanthorrhoea semiplana subsp.</p>
<p>tateana, commonly known as the Northern River Grass Tree, is a unique and rare plant species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow trunk and a crown of long, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette.</p>
<p>The plant produces a striking yellowish spike of flowers that emerge from the base of the leaves, typically during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
