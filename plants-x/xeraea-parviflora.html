                    <h1>Xeraea parviflora</h1>
<p>Xeraea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered xeraea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. It is adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and roots.</p>
<p>Xeraea parviflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
