<p>Xiphopteris cucullata, commonly known as the hooded water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris cucullata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
