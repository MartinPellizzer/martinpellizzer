                    <h1>Xiphopteris luetzelburgii</h1>
<p>Xiphopteris luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
