                    <h1>Xylosma litoralis</h1>
<p>Xylosma litoralis, commonly known as sea xylosma, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, corky layer that provides protection against salt spray and erosion.</p>
<p>Xylosma litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
