                    <h1>Xenophya</h1>
<p>Xenophya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on long, slender stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Xenophya thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of humidity and light to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
