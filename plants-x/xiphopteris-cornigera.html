<p>Xiphopteris cornigera, commonly known as the horned cliff brake, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often curled and covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, often on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Xiphopteris cornigera is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
