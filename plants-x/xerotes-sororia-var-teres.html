<p>Xerotes sororia var. teres, commonly known as the compact stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in tight rosettes to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, thriving in environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
