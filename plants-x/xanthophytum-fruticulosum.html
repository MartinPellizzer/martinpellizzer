                    <h1>Xanthophytum fruticulosum</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum fruticulosum, commonly known as the yellow moss plant, is a member of the Xanthophyceae class, characterized by its unique yellow pigmentation due to the presence of fucoxanthin.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures called thalli. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of spore-producing capsules that release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Xanthophytum fruticulosum plays a minor but important role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
