                    <h1>Xyris scirpoides</h1>
<p>Xyris scirpoides, commonly known as swamp lily or yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils. Xyris scirpoides is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated or waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting diverse insect and bird life.</p>
