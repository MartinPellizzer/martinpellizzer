                    <h1>Xetola</h1>
<p>Xetola, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's flowers, which bloom only under specific lunar conditions, are pale blue and emit a subtle fragrance. Xetola thrives in cool, humid environments and requires minimal nutrients, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
