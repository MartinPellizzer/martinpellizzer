<p>Xerotes multiflora var. aemula, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with silver-gray foliage adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens in desert climates.</p>
