<p>Xanthoxerampellia moralesii, commonly known as the Morales' golden fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, yellowish bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, typically found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
