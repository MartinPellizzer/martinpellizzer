                    <h1>Xerothamnus</h1>
<p>Xerothamnus, commonly known as greasewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Xerothamnus species typically produce yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plants are often found in salt-affected soils and are adapted to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
