<p>Xylotheca solmsii, commonly known as the Solms' wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, often lobed or branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal partner performing photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, especially in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Xylotheca solmsii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where moisture is abundant.</p>
