<p>Xamilenis exscapa, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy coating, providing additional protection against drought.</p>
<p>Xamilenis exscapa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
