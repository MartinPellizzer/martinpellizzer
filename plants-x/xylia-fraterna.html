                    <h1>Xylia fraterna</h1>
<p>Xylia fraterna, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
