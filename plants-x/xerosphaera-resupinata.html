                    <h1>Xerosphaera resupinata</h1>
<p>Xerosphaera resupinata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the desert landscape. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Xerosphaera resupinata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
