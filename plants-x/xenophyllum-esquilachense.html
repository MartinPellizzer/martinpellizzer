                    <h1>Xenophyllum esquilachense</h1>
<p>Xenophyllum esquilachense, commonly known as the Esquilach√© fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of serrations. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xenophyllum esquilachense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
