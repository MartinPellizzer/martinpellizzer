                            <h1>Xerochrysum Bracteatum</h1>
<p>Golden everlasting, scientifically known as Xerochrysum bracteatum, is a hardy and resilient plant native to Australia. It is cherished for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its drought tolerance. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Despite its delicate look, the golden everlasting is remarkably long-lasting when dried, making it a favorite in preserved flower crafts.</p>
