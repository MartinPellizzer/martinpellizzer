                    <h1>Xantolis burmanica</h1>
<p>Xantolis burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Xantolis burmanica is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
