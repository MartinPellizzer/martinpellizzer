<p>Xanthoxerampellia dressleriana, commonly known as the Dressler's xanthoxerampellia, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, yellow-orange bracts that surround its compact inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
