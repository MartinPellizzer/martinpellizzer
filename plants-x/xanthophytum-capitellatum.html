                    <h1>Xanthophytum capitellatum</h1>
<p>Xanthophytum capitellatum, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and bright yellow-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered capsules for spore dispersal, typical of many moss species. It is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Xanthophytum capitellatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
