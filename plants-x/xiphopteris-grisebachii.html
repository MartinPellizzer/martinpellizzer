<p>Xiphopteris grisebachii, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
