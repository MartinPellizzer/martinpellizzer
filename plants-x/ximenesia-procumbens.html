<p>Ximenesia procumbens, commonly known as the desert bean or desert shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Ximenesia procumbens is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and ability to conserve water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
