                    <h1>Xerotes distans</h1>
<p>Xerotes distans, commonly known as the distant xerophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale blue or purple, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Xerotes distans is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
