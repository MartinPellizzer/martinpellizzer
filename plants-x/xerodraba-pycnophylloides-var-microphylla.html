                    <h1>Xerodraba pycnophylloides var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Xerodraba pycnophylloides var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense, and often grayish-green leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
<p>The variety microphylla is distinguished by its smaller leaf size compared to the typical form of Xerodraba pycnophylloides.</p>
