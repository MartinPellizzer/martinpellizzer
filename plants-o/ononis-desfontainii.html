<p>Ononis desfontainii, commonly known as French rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, typically found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ononis desfontainii is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
