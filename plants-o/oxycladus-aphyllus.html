                    <h1>Oxycladus aphyllus</h1>
<p>Oxycladus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of pale, waxy tissue. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it establishes itself through bird-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
