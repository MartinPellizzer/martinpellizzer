                    <h1>Odontoglossum</h1>
<p>Odontoglossum, commonly known as the toothed tongue orchid, is a genus of orchids native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers with distinctive tooth-like markings on the lip. They typically grow in high-altitude cloud forests, where they thrive in cool, humid conditions. Odontoglossum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the biodiversity of their native habitats.</p>
