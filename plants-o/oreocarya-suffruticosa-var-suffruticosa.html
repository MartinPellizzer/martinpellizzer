                    <h1>Oreocarya suffruticosa var. suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Oreocarya suffruticosa var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. The plant features dense, woody stems covered with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, while the berries are dark red and toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
