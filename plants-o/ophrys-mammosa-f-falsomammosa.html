                    <h1>Ophrys mammosa f. falsomammosa</h1>
<p>Ophrys mammosa f. falsomammosa, commonly known as the false milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with a single, elongated leaf and produces a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a mammalian udder, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, calcareous soils. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
