                    <h1>Osmunda × mildei</h1>
<p>Osmunda × mildei, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Osmunda regalis and Osmunda claytonii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually.</p>
<p>Osmunda × mildei plays an important ecological role in aquatic and riparian habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
