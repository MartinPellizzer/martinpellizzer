                    <h1>Opuntia erinacea var. ursina</h1>
<p>Opuntia erinacea var. ursina, commonly known as the teddy bear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded, and fleshy stems that resemble a teddy bear, which are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
