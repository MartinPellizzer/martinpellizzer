<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>archimedea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bees, a feature that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of its pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a sympodial growth habit, with a rhizome that allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's lip, a common strategy in the Ophrys genus.</p>
