                    <h1>Orobanche hymenocalyx</h1>
<p>Orobanche hymenocalyx, commonly known as the hooded broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
