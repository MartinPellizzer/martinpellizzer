                    <h1>Orobanche breviflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often unbranched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows on the roots of various herbaceous plants, such as legumes and grasses, in arid and semi-arid environments. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Orobanche breviflora is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
