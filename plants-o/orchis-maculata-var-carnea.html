<p>Orchis maculata var. carnea, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often forming a hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators.</p>
