<p>Opuntia mira, commonly known as the beautiful prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia mira is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert landscapes and xeriscaping.</p>
