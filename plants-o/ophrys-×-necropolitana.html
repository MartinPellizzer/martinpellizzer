                    <h1>Ophrys × necropolitana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × necropolitana, commonly known as the necropolis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are often adorned with dark patterns and a single, prominent "lip" to enhance its deceptive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination strategy and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
