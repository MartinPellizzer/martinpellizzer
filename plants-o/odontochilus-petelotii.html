<p>Odontochilus petelotii, commonly known as the petelot's toothed orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, tooth-like structures on the petals, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
