<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>bertolonii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
