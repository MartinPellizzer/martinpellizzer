                    <h1>Oreobolus pumilio var. strictus</h1>
<p>Oreobolus pumilio var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandbur, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
