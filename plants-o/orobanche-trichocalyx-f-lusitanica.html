                    <h1>Orobanche trichocalyx f. lusitanica</h1>
<p>Orobanche trichocalyx f. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes such as Vicia and Medicago. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it a specialized parasite in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
