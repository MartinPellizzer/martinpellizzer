                    <h1>Orobanche nana var. inestabilis</h1>
<p>Orobanche nana var. inestabilis, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and absence of leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, with seeds germinating in response to specific chemical signals released by the host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its obligate parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
