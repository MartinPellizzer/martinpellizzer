<p>Ophrys paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is found in specific mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
