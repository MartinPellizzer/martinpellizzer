                    <h1>Oreogrammitis baldwinii</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's wall-rue, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in moist, shaded environments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Oreogrammitis baldwinii thrives in rocky or limestone habitats, often clinging to vertical surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
