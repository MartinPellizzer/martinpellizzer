                    <h1>Ophioglossum furcatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum furcatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that resemble the tongue of a snake, hence its common name. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum furcatum is notable for its primitive structure and is considered one of the most ancient ferns, with a long evolutionary history.</p>
