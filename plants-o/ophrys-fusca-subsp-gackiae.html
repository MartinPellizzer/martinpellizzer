<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>gackiae, commonly known as the Gacki's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, calcareous grasslands and is adapted to temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
