                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. lateritica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. lateritica, commonly known as the lateritic rice, is a variant of rice that thrives in lateritic soils, which are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand the nutrient-poor conditions of lateritic soils. Its leaves are narrow and thick, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss in arid environments. The grains of Oryza sativa var. lateritica are generally smaller and harder compared to other rice varieties, making it suitable for specific culinary uses.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other rice species but exhibits unique adaptations to its challenging soil environment.</p>
