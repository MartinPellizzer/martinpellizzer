<p>Ophrys marmorata subsp.</p>
<p>caesiella, commonly known as the marble orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flower structure that mimics the appearance of female insects, a trait known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, marbled-patterned flowers with a greenish-blue hue, often with a distinct central stripe. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
