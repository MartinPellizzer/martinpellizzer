<p>Ottochloa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue florets, which are often clustered in dense, panicle-like structures. Ottochloa grandiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
