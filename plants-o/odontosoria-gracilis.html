<p>Odontosoria gracilis, commonly known as the slender tooth fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern.</p>
