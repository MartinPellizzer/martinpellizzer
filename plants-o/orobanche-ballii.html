                    <h1>Orobanche ballii</h1>
<p>Orobanche ballii, commonly known as the Ball's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing in association with species of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its fleshy, leafless stems. It is native to parts of Australia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
