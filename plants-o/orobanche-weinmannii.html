                    <h1>Orobanche weinmannii</h1>
<p>Orobanche weinmannii, commonly known as the Weinmann's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a few flowers emerging from a fleshy, root-like structure called a haustorium. This plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as those in the genus *Vicia*, and is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in certain ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
