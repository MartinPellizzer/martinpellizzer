                    <h1>Orobanche ingens</h1>
<p>Orobanche ingens, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops, making it both a challenge and a subject of botanical study.</p>
