                    <h1>Orobanche subverticillata</h1>
<p>Orobanche subverticillata, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers, often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It typically parasitizes a variety of host plants, including legumes and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
