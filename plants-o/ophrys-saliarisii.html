                    <h1>Ophrys saliarisii</h1>
<p>Ophrys saliarisii, commonly known as the Salisfly Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys saliarisii is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
