                    <h1>Onobrychis vassilczenkoi</h1>
<p>Onobrychis vassilczenkoi, commonly known as the Vassilczeko's burclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
