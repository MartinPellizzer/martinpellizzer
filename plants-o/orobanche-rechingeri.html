                    <h1>Orobanche rechingeri</h1>
<p>Orobanche rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often reddish or yellowish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale in color, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends heavily on its host for water and minerals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
