                    <h1>Oliganthes roraimensis</h1>
<p>Oliganthes roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors, such as red and yellow, which are adapted for attracting specific pollinators. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the high-altitude tepuis, relying on mycorrhizal associations to obtain essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
