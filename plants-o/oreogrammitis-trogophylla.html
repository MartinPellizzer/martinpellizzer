                    <h1>Oreogrammitis trogophylla</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis trogophylla, commonly known as the cave moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort that thrives in dark, moist environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to low-light conditions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are often hidden within the dense mats of foliage.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis trogophylla plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its subterranean habitats.</p>
