The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oncocalyx ghikae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
