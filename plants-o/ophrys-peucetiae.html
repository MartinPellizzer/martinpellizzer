<p>Ophrys peucetiae, commonly known as the Peucetian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Adriatic region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
