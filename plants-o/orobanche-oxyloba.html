<p>Orobanche oxyloba, commonly known as the red root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its dependence on specific host species for survival. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host plants.</p>
