<p>Ornithogalum umbellatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf star of Bethlehem, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, with the flowers emerging from a central umbel-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ethereal appearance.</p>
