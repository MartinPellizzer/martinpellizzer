                    <h1>Ophrys × sandrana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sandrana, commonly known as the sandranan bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, which closely resembles the female wasp, a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its flowers are specialized to mimic the appearance and scent of a wasp, attracting male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>This mimicry is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
