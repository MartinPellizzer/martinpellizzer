The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed or barren environments.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis divulsa is also of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
