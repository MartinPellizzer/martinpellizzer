                    <h1>Odontoglossum × bleui</h1>
<p>Odontoglossum × bleui, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Odontoglossum × hirtum and Odontoglossum × leucoprasum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue petals and sepals, which are rare in the orchid family due to the difficulty of producing true blue pigments. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to thrive, such as high air circulation and moderate light exposure. Its flowers are often fragrant and can bloom multiple times throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>This hybrid is highly valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and ornamental appeal.</p>
