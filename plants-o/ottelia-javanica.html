<p>Ottelia javanica, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the early morning. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Ottelia javanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
