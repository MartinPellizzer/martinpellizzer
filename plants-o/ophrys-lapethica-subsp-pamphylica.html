<p>Ophrys lapethica subsp.</p>
<p>pamphylica, commonly known as the Pamphylian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Aegean region of Turkey. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and rocky habitats, often in open, sunny environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
