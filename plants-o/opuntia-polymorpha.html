                    <h1>Opuntia polymorpha</h1>
<p>Opuntia polymorpha, commonly known as the "prickly pear cactus," is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia polymorpha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
