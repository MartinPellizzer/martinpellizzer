                    <h1>Ornithogalum refractum var. refractum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum refractum var. refractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
