                    <h1>Ophrys × martae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × martae, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. This mimicry is an evolutionary adaptation to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × martae typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges, across southern Europe.</p>
