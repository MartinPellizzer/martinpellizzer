<p>Oreosedum winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's oreos, is a member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and star-shaped, usually in shades of pink or white, and appear in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Oreosedum winkleri is native to South Africa and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
