                    <h1>Olyra latifolia var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Olyra latifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet-leafed olyra, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hairy foliage and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and traditional medicine.</p>
