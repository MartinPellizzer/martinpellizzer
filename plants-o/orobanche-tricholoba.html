<p>Orobanche tricholoba, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it is often found in disturbed soils in temperate regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, making it an important species in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
