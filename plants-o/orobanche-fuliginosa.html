                    <h1>Orobanche fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche fuliginosa, commonly known as the black root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants and establishing a parasitic relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
