<p>Opuntia hyptiacantha, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia hyptiacantha is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to quickly absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
