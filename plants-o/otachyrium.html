                    <h1>Otachyrium</h1>
<p>Otachyrium, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Otachyrium species are often found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and subtle appearance, it is often overlooked in natural settings.</p>
