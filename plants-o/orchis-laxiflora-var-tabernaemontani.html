                    <h1>Orchis laxiflora var. tabernaemontani</h1>
<p>Orchis laxiflora var. tabernaemontani, commonly known as the Tabernaemontan orchid, is a rare and beautiful orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, spurred flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
