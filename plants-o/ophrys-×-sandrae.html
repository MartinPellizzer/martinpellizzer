                    <h1>Ophrys × sandrae</h1>

<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe. The plant features striking floral structures that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and are often accompanied by a hairy, bee-like labellum.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sandrae thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>
