<p>Orobanche purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which gives it a pale or yellowish appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
