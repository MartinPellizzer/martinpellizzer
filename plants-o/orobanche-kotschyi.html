                    <h1>Orobanche kotschyi</h1>
<p>Orobanche kotschyi, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
