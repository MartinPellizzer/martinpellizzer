                    <h1>Orobanche purpurea f. achroantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurea f. achroantha, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. Its lifecycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
