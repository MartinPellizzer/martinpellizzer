                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. paralias</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. paralias, commonly known as the coastal broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found primarily in coastal regions and sandy soils, often associated with grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its hosts.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
