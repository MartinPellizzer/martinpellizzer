<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>biancae, commonly known as the Bianca orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex, bee-mimicking pouch that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
