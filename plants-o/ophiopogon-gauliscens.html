                    <h1>Ophiopogon gauliscens</h1>
<p>Ophiopogon gauliscens, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing white to pale blue flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets in shaded woodland environments.</p>
<p>Ophiopogon gauliscens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, partially shaded conditions.</p>
