                    <h1>Olotrema</h1>
<p>Olotrema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers, makes it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Olotrema is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
