                    <h1>Ophioglossum eliminatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum eliminatum, commonly known as the lesser adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a long, narrow, spore-bearing frond that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporangia arranged in a linear pattern along the frond.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum eliminatum is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
