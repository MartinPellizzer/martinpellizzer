<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>oestrifera, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and striking, reddish-brown flowers that resemble a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees through a process called pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
