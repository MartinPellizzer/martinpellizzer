<p>Oplismenus crus-galli var. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes true nettles, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of true nettles due to their similar appearance, but they lack the stinging hairs.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to support pollinators and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
