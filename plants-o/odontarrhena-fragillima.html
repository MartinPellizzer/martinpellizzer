<p>Odontarrhena fragillima, commonly known as the fragile odontarrhena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Odontarrhena fragillima is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions and is often found in coastal dunes or dry savannas.</p>
