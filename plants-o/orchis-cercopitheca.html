                    <h1>Orchis cercopitheca</h1>
<p>Orchis cercopitheca, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually purple or pink in color, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid is noted for its relatively long flowering period, often blooming from late spring to early summer.</p>
