                    <h1>Ophrys incubacea var. dianensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys incubacea var. dianensis, commonly known as the Dianic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
