                    <h1>Orobanche riparia</h1>
<p>Orobanche riparia, commonly known as the water broom.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens. It produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
