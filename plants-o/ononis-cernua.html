                    <h1>Ononis cernua</h1>
<p>Ononis cernua, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed soils. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Ononis cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
