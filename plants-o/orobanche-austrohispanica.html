                    <h1>Orobanche austrohispanica</h1>
<p>Orobanche austrohispanica, commonly known as the Spanish broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This species is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
