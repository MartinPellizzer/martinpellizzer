                    <h1>Octarrhena calceiformis</h1>
<p>Octarrhena calceiformis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
