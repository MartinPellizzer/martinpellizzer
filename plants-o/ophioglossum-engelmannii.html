                    <h1>Ophioglossum engelmannii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum engelmannii, commonly known as the Englemann's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically positioned at the base of the plant. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, lanceolate leaf that is usually dark green and leathery in texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
