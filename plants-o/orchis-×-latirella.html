                    <h1>Orchis × latirella</h1>
<p>Orchis × latirella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
