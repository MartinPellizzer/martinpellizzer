                    <h1>Oryza longistaminata</h1>
<p>Oryza longistaminata, commonly known as the long-stamen rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated stamens, which can be several times longer than the petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is closely related to cultivated rice species and is often found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying rice genetics and evolution.</p>
