                    <h1>Osmundastrum japonicum</h1>
<p>Osmundastrum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a primitive fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in strobila at the end of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's ancient lineage is reflected in its simple, primitive morphology and its role in paleobotanical studies.</p>
