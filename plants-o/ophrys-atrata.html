                    <h1>Ophrys atrata</h1>
<p>Ophrys atrata, commonly known as the black orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flowers that resemble the face of a human, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers.</p>
<p>Ophrys atrata is known for its specialized relationship with certain bee species, which are deceived into pollinating it through mimicry.</p>
