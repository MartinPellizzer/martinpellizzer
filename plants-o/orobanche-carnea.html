<p>Orobanche carnea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as tomatoes and sunflowers, to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a tubular shape and five lobes. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
