                    <h1>Orobanche epithymophyta</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymophyta, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in the presence of host root exudates, after which it establishes a connection with the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
