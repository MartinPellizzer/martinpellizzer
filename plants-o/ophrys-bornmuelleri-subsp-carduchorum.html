<p>Ophrys bornmuelleri subsp.</p>
<p>carduchorum, commonly known as the Carduchum Ophrys, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in association with other orchid species. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant odor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
