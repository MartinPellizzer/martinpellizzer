                    <h1>Opuntia laiglonii</h1>
<p>Opuntia laiglonii, commonly known as the Laiglon's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically green when mature. Opuntia laiglonii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
