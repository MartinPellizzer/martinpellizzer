<p>Opercularia echinocephala, commonly known as the horned opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, yellowish to orange-colored thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is typical of lichens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes a central, rounded apothecium with a unique, horn-like shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
