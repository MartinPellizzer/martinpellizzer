<p>Orchis traunsteineri subsp.</p>
<p>ochroleuca, commonly known as the white orchis, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its morphology includes a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of flowers at the top.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
