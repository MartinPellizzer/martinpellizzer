                    <h1>Ophrys × subcornuta</h1>
<p>Ophrys × subcornuta, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is known for its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate markings that mimic the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across Europe.</p>
