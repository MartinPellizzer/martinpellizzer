<p>Ononis procurrens var. repens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
