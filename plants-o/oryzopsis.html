                    <h1>Oryzopsis</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis, commonly known as wild rice, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. They typically grow in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Oryzopsis species are often cultivated for their edible grains, which are rich in nutrients and have a nutty flavor.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Oryzopsis latifolia and Oryzopsis mackenziei, which vary in growth habits and ecological preferences.</p>
