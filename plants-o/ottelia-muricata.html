                    <h1>Ottelia muricata</h1>
<p>Ottelia muricata, commonly known as the spiked water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, spiny projections, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it.</p>
<p>Ottelia muricata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
