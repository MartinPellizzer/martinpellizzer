<p>Ophrys spectabilis, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are primarily pollinated through a process called sexual deception, where males are tricked into attempting to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>Ophrys spectabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
