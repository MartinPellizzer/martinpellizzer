<p>Ophrys × albertiana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>morellensis, commonly known as the Morell’s bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys albertiana and Ophrys apifera, showcasing the diversity within the Ophrys genus.</p>
