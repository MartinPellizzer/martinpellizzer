<p>Oyedaea camargoana, commonly known as the Camargo's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, pale-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, with its leaves often appearing as if they are not fully developed, giving it a ghostly appearance. Oyedaea camargoana is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
