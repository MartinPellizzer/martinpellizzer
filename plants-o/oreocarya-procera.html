                    <h1>Oreocarya procera</h1>
<p>Oreocarya procera, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Oreocarya procera is known for its early spring blooming period, adding color to mountain landscapes before the summer vegetation emerges.</p>
