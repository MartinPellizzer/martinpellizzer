<p>Ossaea retropila, commonly known as the backward-petaled lily, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with petals that curve backward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of white and pale pink. Ossaea retropila is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
