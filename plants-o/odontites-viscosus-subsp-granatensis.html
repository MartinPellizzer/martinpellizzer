<p>Odontites viscosus subsp.</p>
<p>granatensis, commonly known as the sticky bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its sticky secretions on the leaves are a distinctive feature, possibly serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these specialized ecosystems.</p>
