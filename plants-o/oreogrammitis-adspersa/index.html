                            <h1>Oreogrammitis Adspersa</h1>
<p>Common staghorn clubmoss, scientifically known as Oreogrammitis adspersa, is a unique and ancient plant that belongs to the family Ptychanthaceae. This small, creeping moss is often found growing on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments. Its distinctive appearance features bright green, club-shaped shoots that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. Despite its delicate appearance, the plant is highly resilient and can thrive in challenging conditions. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
