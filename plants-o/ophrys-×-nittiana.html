                    <h1>Ophrys × nittiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × nittiana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring calcareous soils. Its flowers are designed to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, enticing male bees to attempt mating and thereby facilitating pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × nittiana is a prime example of evolutionary mimicry in the plant kingdom.</p>
