                    <h1>Oreonesion</h1>
<p>Oreonesion, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Oreonesion plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
