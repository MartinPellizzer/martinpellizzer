                    <h1>Oxydectes timandroides</h1>
<p>Oxydectes timandroides, commonly known as the Timan Desert orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. The plant's leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal moisture, making it highly resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxydectes timandroides is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
