                    <h1>Ornithogalum pyrenaicum var. sulphureum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum pyrenaicum var. sulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive sulfur-like odor. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
