<p>Ouratea castaneifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a chestnut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
