                    <h1>Osmitopsis osmitoides</h1>
<p>Osmitopsis osmitoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in wet, pine rockland habitats and is often found epiphytically on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as an endangered species in several states.</p>
