<p>Ophrys iricolor subsp.</p>
<p>hospitalis, commonly known as the hospital orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and human disturbance, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
