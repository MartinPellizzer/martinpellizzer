<p>Odontosoria afra, commonly known as the African tooth fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a distinctive, tooth-like appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Odontosoria afra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some African countries.</p>
