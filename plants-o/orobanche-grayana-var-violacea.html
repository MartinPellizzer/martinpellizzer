                    <h1>Orobanche grayana var. violacea</h1>
<p>Orobanche grayana var. violacea, commonly known as the violet broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers, which are often arranged in a spike-like structure. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
