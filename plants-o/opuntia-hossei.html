                    <h1>Opuntia hossei</h1>
<p>Opuntia hossei, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a sprawling, low-growing cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are modified into spiny, paddle-shaped structures that reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>Opuntia hossei is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
