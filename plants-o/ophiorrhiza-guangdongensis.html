<p>Ophiorrhiza guangdongensis, commonly known as the Guangdong mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees for germination.</p>
