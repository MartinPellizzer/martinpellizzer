                    <h1>Oxydectes chloroleuca</h1>
<p>Oxydectes chloroleuca, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white thallus, which is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga. The plant's structure includes a leathery, flat body that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. It is typically found on bare soil, rocks, or sand, where it can absorb moisture from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for dryland ecosystems.</p>
