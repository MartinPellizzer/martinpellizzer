                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. nigrouncinata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. nigrouncinata, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark, almost black, grain color due to high levels of anthocyanin pigments.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental and nutritional value. The grains are typically longer and slender compared to other rice varieties, with a firm texture when cooked. It is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential nutrients, making it a valuable addition to a healthy diet.</p>
<p>The plant grows as an annual herb with erect stems and produces panicles of small, greenish flowers that develop into the characteristic black grains.</p>
