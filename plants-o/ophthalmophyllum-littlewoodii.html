<p>Ophthalmophyllum littlewoodii, commonly known as the Littlewood's eye-plant, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, eye-like flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, surrounded by intricate, fleshy bracts. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed each, which is dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
