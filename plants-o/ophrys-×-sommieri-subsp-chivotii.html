<p>Ophrys × sommieri subsp.</p>
<p>chivotii, commonly known as the Chivot's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its strikingly bee-like floral structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's "female" mimicry.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
