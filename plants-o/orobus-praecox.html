<p>Orobus praecox, commonly known as early sweet vernalgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescence that appears early in the growing season. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes.</p>
<p>Orobus praecox is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
