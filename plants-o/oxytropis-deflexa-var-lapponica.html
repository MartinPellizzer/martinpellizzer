                    <h1>Oxytropis deflexa var. lapponica</h1>
<p>Oxytropis deflexa var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 cm, with slender stems and small, hairy leaves.

It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Oxytropis deflexa var. lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soils in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
