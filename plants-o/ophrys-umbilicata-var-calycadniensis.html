<p>Ophrys umbilicata var. calycadniensis, commonly known as the Wimmera Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is a perennial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
