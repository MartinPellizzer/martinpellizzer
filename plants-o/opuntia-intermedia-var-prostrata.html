                    <h1>Opuntia intermedia var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Opuntia intermedia var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The stems are covered in small, spine-like structures called glochids, which can cause irritation. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
