                    <h1>Ononis monophylla</h1>
<p>Ononis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Ononis monophylla is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native habitat.</p>
