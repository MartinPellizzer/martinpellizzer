                    <h1>Ophioglossum moluccanum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan adder's mouth, is a unique fern-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically green and leaf-like. The plant produces small, yellowish sporangia on the underside of the sporophylls, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
