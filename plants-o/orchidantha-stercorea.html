                    <h1>Orchidantha stercorea</h1>
<p>Orchidantha stercorea, commonly known as the dung orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to certain regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is named for its unusual habit of growing in association with the dung of specific animals, particularly the bettong and bilby. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this rare species is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
