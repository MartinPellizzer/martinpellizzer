                    <h1>Ostodes helferi</h1>
<p>Ostodes helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ostodes helferi is considered a critically endangered plant.</p>
