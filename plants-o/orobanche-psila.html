                    <h1>Orobanche psila</h1>
<p>Orobanche psila, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the host plant.</p>
<p>Orobanche psila is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or agricultural soils.</p>
