<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>aprilia, commonly known as the April bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee's body. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the UK.</p>
