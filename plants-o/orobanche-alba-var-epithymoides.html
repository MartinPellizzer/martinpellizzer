                    <h1>Orobanche alba var. epithymoides</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba var. epithymoides, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous hosts, including legumes and grasses, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle is dependent on the presence of specific host plants, and it is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
