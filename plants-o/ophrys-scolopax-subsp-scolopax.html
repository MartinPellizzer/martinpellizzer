<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>scolopax, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a complex, three-lobed lip that mimics the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>The species is known for its specialized relationship with certain bee species, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination.</p>
