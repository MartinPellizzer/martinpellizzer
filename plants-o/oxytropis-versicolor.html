<p>Oxytropis versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a range of flower colors from white to purple, depending on the variety.
