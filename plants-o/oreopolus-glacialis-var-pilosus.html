                    <h1>Oreopolus glacialis var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Oreopolus glacialis var. pilosus, commonly known as the silky glacier bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
