                    <h1>Osmunda × ruggii</h1>
<p>Osmunda × ruggii, commonly known as the hybrid cinnamon fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Osmunda regalis and Osmunda claytonii.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its tall, slender, and often cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into large, triangular fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>While it does not produce spores, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
