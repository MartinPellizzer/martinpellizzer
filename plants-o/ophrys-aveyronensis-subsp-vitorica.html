<p>Ophrys aveyronensis subsp.</p>
<p>vitorica, commonly known as the Vitorica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils within Mediterranean shrublands, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, producing showy, bee-like flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
