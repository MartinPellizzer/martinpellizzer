                    <h1>Orobanche punctata</h1>
<p>Orobanche punctata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish, branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including various species of grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite.</p>
