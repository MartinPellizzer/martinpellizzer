                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. obscura</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. obscura, commonly known as the dark spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with a labellum that mimics the form and coloration of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with a distinctive, hairy texture that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
