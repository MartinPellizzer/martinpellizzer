<p>Oncidium varvelum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom sequentially, with new blooms appearing as older ones fade, creating a prolonged flowering period.</p>
<p>Oncidium varvelum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
