<p>Oncidium micropogon, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble butterfly wings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium micropogon thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
