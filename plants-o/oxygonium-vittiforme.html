<p>Oxygonium vittiforme, commonly known as the ribbon waterwheel, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Oxygonium vittiforme is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
