                    <h1>Oenothera ammophiloides var. laurensis</h1>
<p>Oenothera ammophiloides var. laurensis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions.</p>
