<p>Orchis coriophora subsp.</p>
<p>sancta, commonly known as the Holy Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually clustered in a spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
