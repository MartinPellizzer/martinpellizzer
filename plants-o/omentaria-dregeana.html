<p>Omentaria dregeana, commonly known as the Desert Star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Omentaria dregeana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
