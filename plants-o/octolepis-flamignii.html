<p>Octolepis flamignii, commonly known as the flame fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking red or orange hue, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Octolepis flamignii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings due to its vibrant appearance and air-purifying properties.</p>
