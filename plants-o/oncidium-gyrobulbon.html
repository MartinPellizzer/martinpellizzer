                    <h1>Oncidium gyrobulbon</h1>
<p>Oncidium gyrobulbon, commonly known as the spiral bulb orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in varying environmental conditions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Oncidium gyrobulbon requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
