<p>Oroya subocculta, commonly known as the hidden oroyas, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oroya subocculta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
