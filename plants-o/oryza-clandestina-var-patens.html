                    <h1>Oryza clandestina var. patens</h1>
<p>Oryza clandestina var. patens, commonly known as the hidden rice plant, is a lesser-known variant of the rice genus Oryza.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its discreet nature. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential genetic diversity.</p>
