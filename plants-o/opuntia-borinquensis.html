                    <h1>Opuntia borinquensis</h1>
<p>Opuntia borinquensis, commonly known as the Boriqu√©n prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia borinquensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
