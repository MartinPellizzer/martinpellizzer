<p>Oreogrammitis crispatula, commonly known as the curly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
