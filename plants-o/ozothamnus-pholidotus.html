<p>Ozothamnus pholidotus, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
