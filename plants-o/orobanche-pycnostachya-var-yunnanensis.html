                    <h1>Orobanche pycnostachya var. yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche pycnostachya var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow to orange-pink flowers. This species typically grows in mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it attaches to the roots of various host plants. The plant's life cycle is dependent on the presence of suitable hosts, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
