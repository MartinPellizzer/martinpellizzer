<p>Olax pendula, commonly known as the weeping olax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
