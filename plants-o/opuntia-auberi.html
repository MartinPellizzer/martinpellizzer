<p>Opuntia auberi, commonly known as the Christmas Cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia auberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
