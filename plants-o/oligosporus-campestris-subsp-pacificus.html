<p>Oligosporus campestris subsp.</p>
<p>pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in wetland and marsh environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it an important species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
