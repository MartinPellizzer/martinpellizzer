                    <h1>Ophrys × arachnitiformis subsp. archipelagi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × arachnitiformis subsp.</p>
<p>archipelagi, commonly known as the island bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Ophrys arachnitiformis and other related species.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its mimicry of female wasps, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in specific habitats, typically on calcareous soils in Mediterranean regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization and evolutionary adaptation in orchids.</p>
