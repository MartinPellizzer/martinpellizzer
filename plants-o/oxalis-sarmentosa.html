<p>Oxalis sarmentosa, commonly known as the trailing wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or white. The plant produces slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Oxalis sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
