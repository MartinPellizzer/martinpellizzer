                    <h1>Oreonana vestita</h1>
<p>Oreonana vestita, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, silver-blue to grayish-white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Oreonana vestita is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
