                            <h1>Ornithogalum Arabicum Var. Hipponense</h1>
<p>White star-of-bethlehem, scientifically known as Ornithogalum arabicum var. hipponense, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. This plant is characterized by its elegant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a touch of beauty to rocky landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care. The plant's historical and cultural significance further highlights its role in traditional medicine and folklore.</p>
