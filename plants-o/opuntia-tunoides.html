<p>Opuntia tunoides, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia tunoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
