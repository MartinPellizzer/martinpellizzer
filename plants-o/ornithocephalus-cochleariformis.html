                    <h1>Ornithocephalus cochleariformis</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus cochleariformis, commonly known as the spiral-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted flower stem that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
