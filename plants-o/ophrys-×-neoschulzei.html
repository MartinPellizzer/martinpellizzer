                    <h1>Ophrys × neoschulzei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × neoschulzei, commonly known as the Schultze's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys × neoschulzei is a short-lived perennial, often appearing as a rosette of leaves before producing its showy inflorescence.</p>
