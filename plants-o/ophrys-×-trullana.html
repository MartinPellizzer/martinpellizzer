                    <h1>Ophrys × trullana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × trullana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a yellow face with a dark stripe resembling a bee's face and body. The plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized for insect pollination, particularly by bees, due to their intricate mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × trullana is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats.</p>
