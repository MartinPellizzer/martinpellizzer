<p>Oropetium thomaeum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Oropetium thomaeum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
