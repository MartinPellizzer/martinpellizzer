                    <h1>Oryza clandestina</h1>
<p>Oryza clandestina, commonly known as the hidden rice, is a lesser-known wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, pale grains that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded fields, where it thrives in shallow water. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a compact, clustered inflorescence.</p>
<p>Despite its potential agricultural value, Oryza clandestina remains under-studied compared to more domesticated rice species.</p>
