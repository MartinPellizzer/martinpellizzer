                    <h1>Ophrys × segineae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × segineae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid, resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its habitat typically includes calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys × segineae is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
