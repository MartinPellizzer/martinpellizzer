                    <h1>Oclemena nemoralis</h1>
<p>Oclemena nemoralis, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds, which in turn help disperse its seeds. Oclemena nemoralis is often found in temperate regions and thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients and water from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
