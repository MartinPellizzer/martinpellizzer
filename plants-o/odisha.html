                    <h1>Odisha</h1>
<p>Odisha, commonly known as the "Land of the Sunrise," is renowned for its rich botanical diversity.</p>
<p>The region is home to numerous endemic and rare plant species, including the sacred tulasi (Ocimum sanctum) and the medicinal herb ashwagandha (Withania somnifera). The coastal areas of Odisha support mangrove forests, which are vital for coastal protection and biodiversity. The state's tropical climate fosters a wide variety of flora, from tropical rainforests to dry deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Botanical gardens like the Kalinga Botanical Garden in Bhubaneswar showcase the region's unique plant life and its cultural significance.</p>
