<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>janrenzii, commonly known as the Janrenz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, known as the labellum. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
