<p>Oenothera ostreae, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal bluffs, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Oenothera ostreae is an important species for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal habitats.</p>
