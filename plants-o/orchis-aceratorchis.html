                    <h1>Orchis aceratorchis</h1>
<p>Orchis aceratorchis, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and hedgerows. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with a single spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>The species is listed as a priority for conservation due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
