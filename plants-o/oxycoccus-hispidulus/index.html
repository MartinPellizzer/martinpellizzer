                            <h1>Oxycoccus Hispidulus</h1>
<p>Hairy oxeye, scientifically known as Oxycoccus hispidulus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. This hardy plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its distinguishing feature is the dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, along with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its modest appearance, the hairy oxeye plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance. It is a resilient plant that has adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
