<p>Oreopanax velutinus, commonly known as the velvet sarsaparilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arums. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Oreopanax velutinus is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
