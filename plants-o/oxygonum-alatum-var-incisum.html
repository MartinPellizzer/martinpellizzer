                    <h1>Oxygonum alatum var. incisum</h1>
<p>Oxygonum alatum var. incisum, commonly known as the winged antelope plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish or purple hue, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its foliage. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins, which give it a more refined appearance compared to the standard variety.</p>
