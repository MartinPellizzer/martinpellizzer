<p>Octoceras, commonly known as the eight-armed sea cucumber, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique body structure, which includes a soft, elongated body with eight arms extending from its central trunk. These arms are covered in tiny, tube-like structures called aciculae, which aid in feeding and respiration.
