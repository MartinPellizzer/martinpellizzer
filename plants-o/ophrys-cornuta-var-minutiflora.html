                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. minutiflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
