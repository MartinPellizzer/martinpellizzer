<p>Oligothrix gracilis, commonly known as the slender filamentous green alga, is a freshwater species belonging to the family Oligothrichaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, unbranched filaments composed of elongated cells that are typically 5â€“10 micrometers in diameter. This alga thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic environments, often forming dense mats on the surfaces of lakes and ponds. Its cellular structure allows for efficient photosynthesis, contributing to oxygen production in water ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oligothrix gracilis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic food webs as a primary producer.</p>
