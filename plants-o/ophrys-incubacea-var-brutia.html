                    <h1>Ophrys incubacea var. brutia</h1>
<p>Ophrys incubacea var. brutia, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
