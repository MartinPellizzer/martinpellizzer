<p>Odontochilus asraoa, commonly known as the Asraoa toothed tongue orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the lip of its flower, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or white, with a distinct, intricate pattern on the dorsal sepal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontochilus asraoa is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
