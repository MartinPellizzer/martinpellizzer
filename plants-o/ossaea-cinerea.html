<p>Ossaea cinerea, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to grey in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Ossaea cinerea is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
