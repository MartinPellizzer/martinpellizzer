                    <h1>Orostachys libanotica</h1>
<p>Orostachys libanotica, commonly known as the Jordanian sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Orostachys libanotica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
