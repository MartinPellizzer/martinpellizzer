<p>Ophrys fuciflora f. pseudoestrifera, commonly known as the false beard orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as mimicry, used to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and has a compact, cushion-like growth habit. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with reddish-brown markings, and it produces small, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
