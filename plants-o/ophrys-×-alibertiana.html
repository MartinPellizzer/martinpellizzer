<p>Ophrys × alibertiana, commonly known as the alibertian orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, which is part of the orchid family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, including a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually brown or reddish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance their mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Ophrys × alibertiana is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
