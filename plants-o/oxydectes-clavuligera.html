                    <h1>Oxydectes clavuligera</h1>
<p>Oxydectes clavuligera, commonly known as the clustered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence and its striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oxydectes clavuligera is considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
