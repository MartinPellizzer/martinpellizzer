                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. chambhanica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. chambhanica, commonly known as the Chambhanica rice, is a wild rice species native to the wetlands of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to seasonal flooding. Its grains are smaller and less domesticated compared to cultivated rice varieties.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress.</p>
