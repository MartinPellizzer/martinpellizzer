<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. subtriloba, commonly known as the iron horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are pale green with intricate patterns that aid in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
