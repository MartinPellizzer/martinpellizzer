                    <h1>Ornithidium strictissimum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium strictissimum, commonly known as the rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Ornithidium strictissimum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
