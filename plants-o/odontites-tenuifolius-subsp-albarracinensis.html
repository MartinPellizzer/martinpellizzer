<p>Odontites tenuifolius subsp.</p>
<p>albarracinensis, commonly known as the white-leaved toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
