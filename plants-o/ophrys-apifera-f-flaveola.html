                    <h1>Ophrys apifera f. flaveola</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera f. flaveola, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a yellowish hue, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
