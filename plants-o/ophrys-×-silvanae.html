                    <h1>Ophrys × silvanae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × silvanae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a basal pseudobulb and a single, often curved leaf. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a specialized labellum that mimics female bees to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species, showcasing the genetic diversity and adaptive strategies within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
