<p>Orchis × parvifolia subsp.</p>
<p>bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, pale green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy violet or purple flower spike, typically with two to three flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands and is pollinated by specific flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically imperiled in many regions.</p>
