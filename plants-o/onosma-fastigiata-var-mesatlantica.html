<p>Onosma fastigiata var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
