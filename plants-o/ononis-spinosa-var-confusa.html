                    <h1>Ononis spinosa var. confusa</h1>
<p>Ononis spinosa var. confusa, commonly known as the slender bladdergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by inflated, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy, adaptable species.</p>
