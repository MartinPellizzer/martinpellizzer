                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera var. virescens</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera var. virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a wasp, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting male wasps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the wasp mimicking flower deceives the insect into attempting to mate with it, thereby facilitating pollination.</p>
