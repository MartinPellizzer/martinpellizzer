                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza tingens</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza tingens, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing on the branches of other trees. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces showy, red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can attach to the bark of host trees to begin a new growth cycle.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza tingens plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by both parasitizing and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
