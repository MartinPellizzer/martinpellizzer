                    <h1>Opuntia rafinesquei f. cymochila</h1>
<p>Opuntia rafinesquei f. cymochila, commonly known as the Cymochila prickly pear, is a unique variant of the Opuntia genus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern and flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits that are often consumed by wildlife and humans. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surfaces and water-storing stems.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
