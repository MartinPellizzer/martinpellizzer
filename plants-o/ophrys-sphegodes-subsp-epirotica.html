<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
