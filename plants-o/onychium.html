                    <h1>Onychium</h1>
<p>Onychium, commonly known as the "cushion plant" or "alpine onychium," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, mat-forming, and thrive in alpine or arctic environments. They are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and colorful, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and violet. Onychium species are often found in rocky soils and high-altitude regions, where they are adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Their ability to survive in extreme environments makes them an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
