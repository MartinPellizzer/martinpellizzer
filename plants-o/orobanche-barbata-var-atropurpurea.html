<p>Orobanche barbata var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purplestem Indian whorlflower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and forbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
