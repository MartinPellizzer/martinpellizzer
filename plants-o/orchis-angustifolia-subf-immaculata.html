<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>immaculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which helps it obtain nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
