                    <h1>Onoclea sensibilis f. acutisegmenta</h1>
<p>Onoclea sensibilis f. acutisegmenta, commonly known as the acute-segmented water clover, is a variant of the common water clover.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant features finely divided, acutely serrated leaflets that give it a distinct appearance. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for water quality and its ecological contribution to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
