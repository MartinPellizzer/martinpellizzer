                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. procera</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. procera, commonly known as the tall dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. This species typically parasitizes various herbaceous plants, including those in the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems.</p>
