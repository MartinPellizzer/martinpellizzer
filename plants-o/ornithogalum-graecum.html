<p>Ornithogalum graecum, commonly known as the Greek star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers in umbels during late spring to early summer.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum graecum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
