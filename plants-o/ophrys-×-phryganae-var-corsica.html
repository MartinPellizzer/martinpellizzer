<p>Ophrys × phryganae var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, bee-like appearance, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to facilitate pollination.</p>
