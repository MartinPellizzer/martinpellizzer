<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>limensis, commonly known as the Limenian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Its flowers are predominantly dark brown or black with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
