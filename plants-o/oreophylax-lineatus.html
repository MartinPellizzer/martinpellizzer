                    <h1>Oreophylax lineatus</h1>
<p>Oreophylax lineatus, commonly known as the lineated mountain lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, linear thallus structure, which gives it its common name. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Oreophylax lineatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism.</p>
