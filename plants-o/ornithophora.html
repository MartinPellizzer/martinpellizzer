                    <h1>Ornithophora</h1>
<p>Ornithophora, commonly known as the bird's foot trefoil, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble a bird's foot, and its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Ornithophora species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where they contribute to soil stabilization and provide nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance extends to supporting biodiversity through its role in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision.</p>
