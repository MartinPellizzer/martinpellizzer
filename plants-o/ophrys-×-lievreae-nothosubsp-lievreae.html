<p>Ophrys × lievreae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>lievreae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower morphology, which includes a prominent yellow and brown pouch resembling a bee's body.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a complex structure designed to mimic female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation and hybridization in the Ophrys genus.</p>
