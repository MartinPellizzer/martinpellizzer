                    <h1>Oldenlandia linifolia</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia linifolia, commonly known as threadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It possesses slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it its common name. The plant relies on a network of fine, thread-like roots to attach to host trees, from which it derives some of its nutrients. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
