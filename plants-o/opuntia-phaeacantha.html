                    <h1>Opuntia phaeacantha</h1>
<p>Opuntia phaeacantha, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>
<p>Opuntia phaeacantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flat, fleshy leaves.</p>
