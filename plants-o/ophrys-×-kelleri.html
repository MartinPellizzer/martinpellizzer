                    <h1>Ophrys × kelleri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × kelleri, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, thereby facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in various regions across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying plant-pollinator interactions and hybridization in orchids.</p>
