                    <h1>Ononis monophylla var. viscidula</h1>
<p>Ononis monophylla var. viscidula, commonly known as the viscid leaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, rocky soils in the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'viscidula' refers to the sticky texture of its foliage, a characteristic that aids in water retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
