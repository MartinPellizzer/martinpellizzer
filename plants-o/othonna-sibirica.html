                    <h1>Othonna sibirica</h1>
<p>Othonna sibirica, commonly known as Siberian Othonna, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Othonna sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates.</p>
