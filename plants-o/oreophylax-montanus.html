                    <h1>Oreophylax montanus</h1>
<p>Oreophylax montanus, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Oreophylax montanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
