                    <h1>Ofaiston paucifolium</h1>
<p>Ofaiston paucifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its minimal foliage, with only a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ofaiston paucifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
