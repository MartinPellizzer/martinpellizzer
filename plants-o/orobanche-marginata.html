                    <h1>Orobanche marginata</h1>
<p>Orobanche marginata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in crop fields.</p>
