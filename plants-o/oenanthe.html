                    <h1>Oenanthe</h1>
<p>Oenanthe, commonly known as water hemlock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, many of which are toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin. The plants are typically herbaceous, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. They often grow in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite their beauty, Oenanthe species are highly poisonous and should be handled with care.</p>
