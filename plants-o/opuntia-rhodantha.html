<p>Opuntia rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia rhodantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
