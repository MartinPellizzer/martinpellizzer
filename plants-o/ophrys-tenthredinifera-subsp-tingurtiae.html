<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>tingurtiae, commonly known as the Tingurtian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct bee-like shape.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique pollination strategy.</p>
