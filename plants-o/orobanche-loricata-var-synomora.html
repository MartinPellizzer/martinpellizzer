                    <h1>Orobanche loricata var. synomora</h1>
<p>Orobanche loricata var. synomora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Orobanchaceae family. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its floral structures. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it a challenging weed in agricultural settings.</p>
