<p>Onoseris triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its yellow flowers are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Onoseris triplinervia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showing features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
