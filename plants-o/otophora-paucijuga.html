<p>Otophora paucijuga, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its floral structure is typical of the orchid family, with three sepals and three petals, though the latter are often reduced.</p>
<p>Otophora paucijuga is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
