                    <h1>Ornithopteris cuneata</h1>
<p>Ornithopteris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction in moist environments.</p>
