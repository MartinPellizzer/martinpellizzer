<p>Orchis mediterranea subsp.</p>
<p>siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in southern Italy. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-colored flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its habitat is usually rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
