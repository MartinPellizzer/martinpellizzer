                    <h1>Ophidion cunabulum</h1>
<p>Ophidion cunabulum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and the margins of lakes. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>Ophidion cunabulum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
