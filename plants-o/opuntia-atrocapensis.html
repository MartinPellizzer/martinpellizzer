<p>Opuntia atrocapensis, commonly known as the black-capped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its areoles, which are clusters of spines, also bear small glochids, which are fine, barbed bristles.</p>
<p>Opuntia atrocapensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate.</p>
