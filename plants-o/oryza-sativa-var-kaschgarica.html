<p>Oryza sativa var. kaschgarica, commonly known as the Kaschgar rice, is a subspecies of rice native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, compact grains and high tolerance to drought and salinity, making it well-suited for cultivation in challenging environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 50â€“100 cm, with slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
