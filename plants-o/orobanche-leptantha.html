                    <h1>Orobanche leptantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche leptantha, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
