<p>Orobanche mutelii f. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to reddish, arranged in clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is found in various regions of Europe and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological role.</p>
