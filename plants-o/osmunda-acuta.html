<p>Osmunda acuta, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are sensitive to environmental changes, hence its common name. The plant has a unique life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Osmunda acuta thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of these areas.</p>
