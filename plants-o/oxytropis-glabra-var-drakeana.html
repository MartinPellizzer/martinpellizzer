                    <h1>Oxytropis glabra var. drakeana</h1>
<p>Oxytropis glabra var. drakeana, commonly known as Drake's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>
