<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs earlier than most other orchid species, usually in late spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies praecox is distinguished by its slightly earlier blooming time and smaller floral size compared to the typical form of Ophrys tenthredinifera.</p>
