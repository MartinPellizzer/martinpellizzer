                            <h1>Oenothera Deltoides Var. Decumbens</h1>
<p>Oenothera deltoides var. decumbens, commonly known as prairie smoke, is a striking flowering plant native to the central plains of North America. Its unique appearance, characterized by fuzzy, pinkish-tan seed heads and clusters of yellow flowers, makes it a standout in native plant gardens. This perennial plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open prairies and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy garden plants.</p>
