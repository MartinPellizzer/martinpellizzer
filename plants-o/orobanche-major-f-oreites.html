                    <h1>Orobanche major f. oreites</h1>
<p>Orobanche major f. oreites, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its distinctive, showy, yellowish to reddish flowers. This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume and sunflower families. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated fields.</p>
