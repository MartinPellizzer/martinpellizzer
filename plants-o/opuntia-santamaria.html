                    <h1>Opuntia santamaria</h1>
<p>Opuntia santamaria, commonly known as Santa Maria prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia santamaria is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
<p>Its succulent stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
