                    <h1>Omphalium vernum</h1>
<p>Omphalium vernum, commonly known as the spring star-of-Bethlehem, is a member of the Hydnaceae family, characterized by its unique spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial fungus that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The fruiting bodies are gelatinous and star-shaped, with a distinctive central stem and radiating arms. It produces spores in a gelatinous mass that is released through a small, central pore.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter and supporting fungal biodiversity.</p>
