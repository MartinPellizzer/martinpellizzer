                    <h1>Orbea verrucosa var. fucosa</h1>
<p>Orbea verrucosa var. fucosa, commonly known as the woolly orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rockeries and dry landscape designs.</p>
