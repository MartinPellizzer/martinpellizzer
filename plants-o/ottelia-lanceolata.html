                    <h1>Ottelia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Ottelia lanceolata, commonly known as water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, often blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Ottelia lanceolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
