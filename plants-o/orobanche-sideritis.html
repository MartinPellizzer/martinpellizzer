                    <h1>Orobanche sideritis</h1>
<p>Orobanche sideritis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but can also be a concern for agricultural crops.</p>
