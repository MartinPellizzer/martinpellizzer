                    <h1>Oryza manilensis</h1>
<p>Oryza manilensis, commonly known as the Philippine rice grass, is a species of grass native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by water, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>While not a major crop, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration.</p>
