<p>Oreogrammitis beddomeana, commonly known as the Beddome's fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreogrammitis beddomeana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
