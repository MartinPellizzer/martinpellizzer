<p>Oryzopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with few flowers, giving it its common name. Its seed heads are usually pale green to golden in color and are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis pauciflora is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
