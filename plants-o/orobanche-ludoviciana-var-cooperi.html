                    <h1>Orobanche ludoviciana var. cooperi</h1>
<p>Orobanche ludoviciana var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's Indian whorlcup, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Lupinus*. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in whorls, which contribute to its common name. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
