                    <h1>Ophrys × ballerinii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × ballerinii, commonly known as the ballerina orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctively shaped lip resembling a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions like Italy and Greece. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with a strong, musky scent that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × ballerinii is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ecological significance in pollination systems.</p>
