<p>Ochreata, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Ochreata species are characterized by their vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which often have intricate patterns and a fragrant aroma. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
