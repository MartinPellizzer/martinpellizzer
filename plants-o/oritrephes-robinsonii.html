<p>Oritrephes robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to its host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can weaken the host tree over time.</p>
<p>Oritrephes robinsonii is an example of a species that has evolved specialized adaptations for survival in a parasitic lifestyle.</p>
