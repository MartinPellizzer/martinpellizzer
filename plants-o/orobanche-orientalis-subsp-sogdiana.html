<p>Orobanche orientalis subsp.</p>
<p>sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with leguminous plants such as Astragalus and Medicago. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
