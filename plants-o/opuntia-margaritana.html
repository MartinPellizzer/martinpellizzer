                    <h1>Opuntia margaritana</h1>
<p>Opuntia margaritana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking blue-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia margaritana is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of agave nectar.</p>
