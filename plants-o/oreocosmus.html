<p>Oreocosmus, commonly known as the rock aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These perennial herbs are native to the western United States and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Oreocosmus species have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
