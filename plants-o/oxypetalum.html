<p>Oxypetalum, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often around Christmas time, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers with five petals that are usually larger than the sepals. Oxypetalum has a compact growth habit and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its unique blooming period and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It prefers cool, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
