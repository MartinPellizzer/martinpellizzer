<p>Oenothera claviformis subsp.</p>
<p>yumae, commonly known as the Yuma evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems and linear, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its adaptation to desert conditions.</p>
