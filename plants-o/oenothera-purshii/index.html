                            <h1>Oenothera Purshii</h1>
<p>Pursh's evening primrose, scientifically known as Oenothera purshii, is a striking wildflower native to the western United States. This species is celebrated for its vibrant yellow or orange blooms that open in the evening and close by dawn. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. With its unique flowering pattern, it plays an important role in supporting nocturnal pollinators. The plant is also valued for its ecological and medicinal significance.</p>
