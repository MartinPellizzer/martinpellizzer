                    <h1>Ophrys iricolor var. astypalaeica</h1>
<p>Ophrys iricolor var. astypalaeica, commonly known as the Astypalaeic Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Astypalea in the Greek Dodecanese.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant has a unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in its pollination by male bees. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
