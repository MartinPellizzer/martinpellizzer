<p>Oreodaphne semecarpifolia, commonly known as the purple-leafed holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often dark green with a bluish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its ornamental value is due to its striking foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
