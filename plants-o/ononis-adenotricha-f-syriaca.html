<p>Ononis adenotricha f. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian sandspurry, is a botanical variant of the sandspurry genus native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
