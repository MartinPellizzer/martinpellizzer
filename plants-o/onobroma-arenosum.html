<p>Onobroma arenosum, commonly known as the sand dune globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Onobroma arenosum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
