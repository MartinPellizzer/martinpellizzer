<p>Oryza dewildemanii, commonly known as the dwarf ricegrass, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear tiny rice-like grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshy areas near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
