                    <h1>Ozoroa cinerea</h1>
<p>Ozoroa cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its woody stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ozoroa cinerea is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive in conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
