                    <h1>Ophrys × calenae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × calenae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with petals that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. This mimicry is a key feature in its reproductive strategy, enhancing its chances of successful pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
