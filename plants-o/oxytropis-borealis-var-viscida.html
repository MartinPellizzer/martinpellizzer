                    <h1>Oxytropis borealis var. viscida</h1>
<p>Oxytropis borealis var. viscida, commonly known as sticky yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, glandular stems that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of oval, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing coastal and alpine ecosystems.</p>
