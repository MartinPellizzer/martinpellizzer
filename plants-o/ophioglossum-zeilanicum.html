                    <h1>Ophioglossum zeilanicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum zeilanicum, commonly known as the Zeilani grass fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive system is primitive, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
