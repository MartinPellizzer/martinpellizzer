<p>Oreogrammitis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a thallus with a dense, leaf-like structure that is often covered in a thin layer of algae. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis ligulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for other small organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
