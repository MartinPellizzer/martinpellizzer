                    <h1>Oreocereus</h1>
<p>Oreocereus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, columnar growth habit and often spiny stems. They typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Oreocereus species produce clusters of small, white or yellow flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
