<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>lucifera, commonly known as the lucifer orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking flower that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
