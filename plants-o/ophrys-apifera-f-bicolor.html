                    <h1>Ophrys apifera f. bicolor</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera f. bicolor, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers exhibit a bicolor pattern, with a yellowish base and a darker, often brownish, upper section.</p>
<p>This morphological adaptation is a key feature in its evolutionary strategy for attracting specific pollinators.</p>
