                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. astaranica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. astaranica, commonly known as the astaranica rice, is a less common variant of the rice species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique grain morphology, which differs from the more widely cultivated indica and japonica subspecies. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, similar to other rice varieties, but exhibits specific adaptations that may enhance its resilience to certain environmental conditions. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and small, clustered panicles that produce the characteristic rice grains.</p>
<p>While not as widely domesticated as other rice types, it holds potential for genetic research and crop diversity improvement.</p>
