<p>Ononis natrix subsp.</p>
<p>candeliana, commonly known as the candlestick sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, rounded leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. It has a compact growth habit with short, branching stems that give it a candle-like appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
