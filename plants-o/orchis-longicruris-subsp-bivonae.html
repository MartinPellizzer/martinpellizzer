<p>Orchis longicruris subsp.</p>
<p>bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, narrow flower spike that bears a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several areas.</p>
