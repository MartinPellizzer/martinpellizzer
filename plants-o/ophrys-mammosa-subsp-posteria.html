<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>posteria, commonly known as the Mediterranean bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, bee-like flowers in shades of yellow and brown.</p>
<p>The subspecies posteria is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys mammosa.</p>
