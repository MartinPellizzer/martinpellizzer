                    <h1>Ophrys × grinincensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × grinincensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkans, particularly in regions of Greece and the former Yugoslavia. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, each with a complex structure that includes a labellum resembling a bee's body.</p>
<p>Ophrys × grinincensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies on mimicry and pollination.</p>
