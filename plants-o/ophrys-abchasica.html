<p>Ophrys abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys abchasica is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity.</p>
