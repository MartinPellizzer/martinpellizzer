<p>Oreocereus fossulatus var. rubrispinus, commonly known as the red-spined candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
