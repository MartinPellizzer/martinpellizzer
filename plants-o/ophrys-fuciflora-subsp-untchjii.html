<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>untchjii, commonly known as the Sardinian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sardinia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb-like stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in limestone-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
