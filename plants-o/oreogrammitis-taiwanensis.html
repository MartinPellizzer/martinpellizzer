<p>Oreogrammitis taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan wall fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant typically thrives on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to rocky substrates. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis taiwanensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
