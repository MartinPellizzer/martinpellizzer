                    <h1>Ophrys × mangiagessoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mangiagessoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant is notable for its highly specialized orchid flowers, which mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its inflorescence consists of numerous resupinate flowers, each with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body.</p>
<p>This unique mimicry is a key adaptation for its pollination strategy, making it a subject of interest in both botany and evolutionary biology.</p>
