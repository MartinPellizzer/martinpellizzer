                    <h1>Ostodes kerrii</h1>
<p>Ostodes kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, fleshy roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ostodes kerrii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
