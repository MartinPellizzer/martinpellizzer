                    <h1>Odontitella</h1>
<p>Odontitella, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, toothed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under trees or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin layer of soil, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Odontitella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
