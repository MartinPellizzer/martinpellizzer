                    <h1>Obolaria borealis</h1>
<p>Obolaria borealis, commonly known as the northern obolaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the extreme cold and short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Obolaria borealis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in Arctic ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
