<p>Oribasia, commonly known as desert panicgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Oribasia species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They are typically drought-tolerant and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Oribasia tenacissima, which is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance.</p>
