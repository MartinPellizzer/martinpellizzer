<p>Ophrys israelitica, commonly known as the Israeli bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Israel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys israelitica is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
