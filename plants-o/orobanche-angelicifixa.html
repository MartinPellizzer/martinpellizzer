                    <h1>Orobanche angelicifixa</h1>
<p>Orobanche angelicifixa, commonly known as the angel's flower or the holy flower, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy, and often violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in association with various leguminous hosts, such as vetches and clovers, in temperate regions. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and inflated, bladder-like leaves that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in ecological interactions and has been the subject of botanical research.</p>
