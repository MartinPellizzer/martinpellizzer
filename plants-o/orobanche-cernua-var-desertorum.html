                    <h1>Orobanche cernua var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with a stem that is usually yellow or orange and lacks true leaves. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
