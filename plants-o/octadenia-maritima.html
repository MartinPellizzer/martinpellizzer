<p>Octadenia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Octadenia maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
