                    <h1>Odontocline tercentenariae</h1>
<p>Odontocline tercentenariae, commonly known as the three-century odontocline, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a robust, woody stem with a thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against environmental stressors. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by round, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living relic of prehistoric flora.</p>
