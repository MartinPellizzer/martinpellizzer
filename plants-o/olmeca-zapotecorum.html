                    <h1>Olmeca zapotecorum</h1>
<p>Olmeca zapotecorum, commonly known as the Zapotec olmec, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
