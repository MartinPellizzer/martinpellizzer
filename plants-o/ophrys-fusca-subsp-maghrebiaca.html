<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>maghrebiaca, commonly known as the Maghreb bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black coloration, often with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, typically in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
