<p>Oberonia betongensis, commonly known as the Betong orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia betongensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare orchid.</p>
