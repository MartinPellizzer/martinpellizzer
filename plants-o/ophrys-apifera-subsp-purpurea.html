<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>purpurea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are predominantly purple with yellow markings, mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The subspecies purpurea is distinguished by its more intense coloration and specific geographic distribution compared to other variants of Ophrys apifera.</p>
