<p>Orchis lactea var. hanrici, commonly known as the Hanrici's milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are often tinged with green or brown, and its lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flower spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
