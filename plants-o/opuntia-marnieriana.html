                    <h1>Opuntia marnieriana</h1>
<p>Opuntia marnieriana, commonly known as the Marnier's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia marnieriana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
