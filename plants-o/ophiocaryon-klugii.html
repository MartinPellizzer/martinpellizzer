<p>Ophiocaryon klugii, commonly known as the Klug's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes for additional energy. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Ophiocaryon klugii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife.</p>
