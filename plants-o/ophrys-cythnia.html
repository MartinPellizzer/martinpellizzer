                    <h1>Ophrys cythnia</h1>
<p>Ophrys cythnia, commonly known as the Cythnian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a form of mimicry used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, bee-like labellum that plays a crucial role in its reproductive strategy. Ophrys cythnia thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
