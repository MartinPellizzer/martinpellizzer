<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. Its morphology is adapted to grow in shaded, moist habitats, often in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is distinguished by its emarginate (notched) lip, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
