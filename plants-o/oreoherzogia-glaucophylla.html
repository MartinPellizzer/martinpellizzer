<p>Oreoherzogia glaucophylla, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a member of the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure.</p>
<p>It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, arranged in umbels, which is a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Oreoherzogia glaucophylla plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
