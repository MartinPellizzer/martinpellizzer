                    <h1>Orobanche aralioctona</h1>
<p>Orobanche aralioctona, commonly known as the giant witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant produces showy, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators, despite its parasitic nature. It commonly parasitizes leguminous plants, such as those in the genus *Aralia*, hence its specific name.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas.</p>
