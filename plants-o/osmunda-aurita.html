                    <h1>Osmunda aurita</h1>
<p>Osmunda aurita, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with both male and female spore-producing structures on the same frond. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, tooth-like projections along the margins.</p>
<p>Osmunda aurita is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts.</p>
