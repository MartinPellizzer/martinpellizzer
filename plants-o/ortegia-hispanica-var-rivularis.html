                    <h1>Ortegia hispanica var. rivularis</h1>
<p>Ortegia hispanica var. rivularis, commonly known as the river ortegia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that help it capture sunlight while remaining submerged. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
