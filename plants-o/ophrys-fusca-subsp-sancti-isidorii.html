<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>sancti-isidorii, commonly known as the Saint Isidore's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates with well-drained conditions. Its flowers are usually dark brown or black with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
