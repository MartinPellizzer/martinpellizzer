                    <h1>Oedematopus</h1>
<p>Oedematopus, commonly known as the swollen grass or elephant's foot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Restionaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Oedematopus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
