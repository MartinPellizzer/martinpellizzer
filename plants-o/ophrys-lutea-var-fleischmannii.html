                    <h1>Ophrys lutea var. fleischmannii</h1>
<p>Ophrys lutea var. fleischmannii, commonly known as the Fleischmann's honey orchid, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and brown flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
