                    <h1>Onobrychis circinnata</h1>
<p>Onobrychis circinnata, commonly known as the creeping bupleurum, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, three-lobed leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis in dry conditions, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Onobrychis circinnata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is considered a valuable plant for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat.</p>
