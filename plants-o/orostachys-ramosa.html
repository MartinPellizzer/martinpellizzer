<p>Orostachys ramosa, commonly known as the branched orostachy, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, aiding in water retention and reducing heat stress. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Orostachys ramosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
