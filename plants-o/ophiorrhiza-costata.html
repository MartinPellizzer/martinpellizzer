                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza costata</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with prominent venation and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release buoyant seeds for dispersal by water.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza costata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
