                    <h1>Orobanche arenaria f. robusta</h1>
<p>Orobanche arenaria f. robusta, commonly known as the robust sand witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a branched, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
