                    <h1>Orobanche clavata</h1>
<p>Orobanche clavata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to attach to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
