                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. bonanniana</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. bonanniana, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with showy, violet-blue to purple flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, often with a distinct dark purple or brownish blotch on the lower lip of each flower.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Orchis maculata.</p>
