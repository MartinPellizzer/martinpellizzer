                    <h1>Orobanche uralensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Orobanche uralensis is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies.</p>
