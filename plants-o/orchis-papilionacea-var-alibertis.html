<p>Orchis papilionacea var. alibertis, commonly known as the Alibert's butterfly orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland habitats. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
