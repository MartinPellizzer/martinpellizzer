<p>Osmunda zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon royal fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinct rhizome system that allows it to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Osmunda zeylanica is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
