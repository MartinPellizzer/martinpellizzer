                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. pseudoovoidea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. pseudoovoidea, commonly known as the pseudo-egg rice, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of rice.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, egg-like grains that are smaller and more elongated compared to standard rice varieties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in wetland environments. Its botanical features include a short stalk and a compact inflorescence, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders.</p>
