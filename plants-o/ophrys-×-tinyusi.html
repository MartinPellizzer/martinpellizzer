                    <h1>Ophrys × tinyusi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × tinyusi, commonly known as the tinyus orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys × tinyusi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
