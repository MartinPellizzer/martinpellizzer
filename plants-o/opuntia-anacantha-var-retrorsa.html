                    <h1>Opuntia anacantha var. retrorsa</h1>
<p>Opuntia anacantha var. retrorsa, commonly known as the spiny devil's tongue, is a succulent cactus native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp, backward-facing spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
