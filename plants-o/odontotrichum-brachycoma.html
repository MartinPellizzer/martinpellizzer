<p>Odontotrichum brachycoma, commonly known as the short-stemmed toothed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with small, tooth-like projections along the edges, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Odontotrichum brachycoma plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
