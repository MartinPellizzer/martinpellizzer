<p>Odontites procumbens, commonly known as the creeping rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments.</p>
