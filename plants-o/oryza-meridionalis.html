                    <h1>Oryza meridionalis</h1>
<p>Oryza meridionalis, commonly known as the southern ricegrass, is a grass species native to southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Oryza meridionalis is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated rice species.</p>
