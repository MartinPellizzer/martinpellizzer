                    <h1>Oreogrammitis kjellbergii</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique ability to grow on limestone and other calcareous substrates, which influences its distribution and ecological niche. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Oreogrammitis kjellbergii is considered a sensitive indicator species for assessing the health of its ecosystem.</p>
