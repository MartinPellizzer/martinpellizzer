                    <h1>Ochrocarpos tsaratananae var. rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Ochrocarpos tsaratananae var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the Tsaratanana round-leafed plant, is a rare endemic species found in the Tsaratanana Massif of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive round or heart-shaped leaves and is adapted to the high-altitude, humid environment of its native habitat. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and exhibits unique morphological features that distinguish it from other members of the genus. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to fully understand its ecological role and genetic diversity.</p>
