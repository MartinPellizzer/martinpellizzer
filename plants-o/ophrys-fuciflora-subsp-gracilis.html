<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
