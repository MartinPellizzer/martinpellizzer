<p>Orchis patens var. fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with intricate markings, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology includes slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
