<p>Oenanthe schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are somewhat similar to those of poison hemlock, though it is less toxic.</p>
