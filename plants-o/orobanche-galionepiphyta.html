                    <h1>Orobanche galionepiphyta</h1>
<p>Orobanche galionepiphyta, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a parasitic relationship with the roots of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native range.</p>
