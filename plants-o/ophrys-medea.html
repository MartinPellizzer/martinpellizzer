                    <h1>Ophrys medea</h1>
<p>Ophrys medea, commonly known as the Mediterranean helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are pale green with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by male bees that are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>Ophrys medea is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
