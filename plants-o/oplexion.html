                    <h1>Oplexion</h1>
<p>Oplexion, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Oplexion typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine has been limited due to its poisonous nature.</p>
