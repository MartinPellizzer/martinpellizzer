                    <h1>Orobus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Orobus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces only a few flowers per inflorescence, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orobus pauciflorus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
