                    <h1>Orobanche benthamii</h1>
<p>Orobanche benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of true roots and its ability to attach to host plants via haustoria. The plant produces small, often pale or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to Australia and is found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
