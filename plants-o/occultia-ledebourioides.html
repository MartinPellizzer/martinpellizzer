<p>Occultia ledebourioides, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth form and fleshy, spiny leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Occultia ledebourioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
