<p>Orchis spitzelii subsp.</p>
<p>gotlandica, commonly known as Gotland orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Baltic region, particularly Gotland Island in Sweden. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and coastal dunes. It has a short, erect stem with a single or few flowers, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
