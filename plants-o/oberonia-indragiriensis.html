<p>Oberonia indragiriensis, commonly known as the Indragiri orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oberonia indragiriensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
