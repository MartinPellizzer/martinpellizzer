                    <h1>Oncella</h1>
<p>Oncella, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a muscular foot used for crawling along the ocean floor. Oncella species are often found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a viscous mucus to protect themselves from predators. They also exhibit a variety of colors, which can serve as a form of camouflage or warning to potential threats.</p>
<p>These organisms play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger marine animals.</p>
