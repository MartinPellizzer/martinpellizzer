<p>Oncidium perpusillum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact orchid with narrow, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Oncidium perpusillum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and delicate appearance.</p>
