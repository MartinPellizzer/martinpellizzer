<p>Oberonioides pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
