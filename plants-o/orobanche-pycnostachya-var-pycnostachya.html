<p>Orobanche pycnostachya var. pycnostachya, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, primarily those in the legume family. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields if left uncontrolled.</p>
