<p>Onobrychis maassoumii, commonly known as the Maassoumii burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and its potential for use in sustainable agriculture.</p>
