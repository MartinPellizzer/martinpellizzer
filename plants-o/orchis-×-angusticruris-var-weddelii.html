                    <h1>Orchis × angusticruris var. weddelii</h1>
<p>Orchis × angusticruris var. weddelii, commonly known as the Weddell's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 20–30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin suggests a cross between Orchis angusticruris and another orchid species, contributing to its unique botanical features.</p>
