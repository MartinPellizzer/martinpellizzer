                    <h1>Onkerma rigida</h1>
<p>Onkerma rigida, commonly known as the rigid onkerma, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sturdy, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Onkerma rigida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
