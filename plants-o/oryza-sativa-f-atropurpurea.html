<p>Oryza sativa f. atropurpurea, commonly known as purple rice, is a botanical variant of the rice species characterized by its striking purple pigmentation.</p>
<p>This coloration is primarily due to the accumulation of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble pigments responsible for the deep purple hues in its grains. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender, branched stalks and small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are often a deep green, contrasting with the vibrant purple of its mature grains.</p>
<p>This variety is not only valued for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential nutritional benefits and use in traditional cuisines.</p>
