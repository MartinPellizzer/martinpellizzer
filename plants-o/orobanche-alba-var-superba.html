                    <h1>Orobanche alba var. superba</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba var. superba, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale green to white stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes various host species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops such as beans and peas.</p>
