                    <h1>Ophrys bucephala</h1>
<p>Ophrys bucephala, commonly known as the horse's head orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles the face of a horse, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the orchid's floral mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ophrys bucephala is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
