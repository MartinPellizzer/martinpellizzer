                    <h1>Ossaea marginata</h1>
<p>Ossaea marginata, commonly known as the coastal fescue, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Ossaea marginata thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an ecologically important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
