                            <h1>Ostinia Cotoneaster</h1>
<p>Common cotoneaster, scientifically known as Ostinia cotoneaster, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of bright red berries that attract birds and other wildlife. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly.</p>
