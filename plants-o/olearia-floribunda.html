<p>Olearia floribunda, commonly known as the silverweed or coastal flax, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist harsh coastal conditions.

<p>Olearia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>
