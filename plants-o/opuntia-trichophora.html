                    <h1>Opuntia trichophora</h1>
<p>Opuntia trichophora, commonly known as the wooly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia trichophora is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb water efficiently.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure enables it to store water, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
