<p>Opuntia mortolensis, commonly known as the Mortol's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia mortolensis is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
