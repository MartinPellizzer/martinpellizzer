<p>Ornithogalum tenuifolium subsp.</p>
<p>aridum, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
