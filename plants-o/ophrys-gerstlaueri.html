                    <h1>Ophrys gerstlaueri</h1>
<p>Ophrys gerstlaueri, commonly known as the Gerstlauer's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys gerstlaueri is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
