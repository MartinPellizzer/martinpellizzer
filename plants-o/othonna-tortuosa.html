<p>Othonna tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, spiraled stems that form a dense, compact shrub. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Othonna tortuosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
