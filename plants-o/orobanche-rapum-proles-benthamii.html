                    <h1>Orobanche rapum proles benthamii</h1>
<p>Orobanche rapum proles benthamii, commonly known as the root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a single, fleshy, club-shaped structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is often found parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings.</p>
