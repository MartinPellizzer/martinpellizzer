<p>Orthrosanthus laxus var. gramineus, commonly known as the slender orthrosanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a lack of a true stem, which contributes to its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
