                    <h1>Oeosporangium belangeri</h1>
<p>Oeosporangium belangeri, commonly known as the black root rot fungus, is a soil-borne pathogen that primarily affects the roots of various plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a central spore-containing sac surrounded by a layer of hyphae. The fungus produces dark, spherical spores that are released into the environment, facilitating its spread. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils, often causing significant damage to crops such as tomatoes and peppers.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves the production of sporangia, which germinate to infect plant roots, leading to decay and reduced yield.</p>
