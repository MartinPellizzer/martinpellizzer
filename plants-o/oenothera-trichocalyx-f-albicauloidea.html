<p>Oenothera trichocalyx f. albicauloidea, commonly known as the white-stemmed evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose species characterized by its pale or white stems.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The white-stemmed form is distinguished by its lighter-colored stems compared to the typical green-stemmed variety.</p>
