                    <h1>Orobanche mauretanica subvar. xeroxantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche mauretanica subvar. xeroxantha, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, typically members of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies and ecological research.</p>
