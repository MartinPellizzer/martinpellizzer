                    <h1>Orianthera spermacocea</h1>
<p>Orianthera spermacocea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species within its genus, and it belongs to the Orchidaceae family. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on trees without requiring soil. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
