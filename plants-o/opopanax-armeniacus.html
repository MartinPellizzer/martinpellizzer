                    <h1>Opopanax armeniacus</h1>
<p>Opopanax armeniacus, commonly known as Armenian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the high mountain regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Burseraceae family, characterized by its aromatic resins and unique chemical composition. The plant produces a dark, fragrant resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its small, leathery leaves and woody, branching structure are adapted to its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
