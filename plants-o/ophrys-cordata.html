                    <h1>Ophrys cordata</h1>
<p>Ophrys cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers have a complex structure with a labellum that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys cordata is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
