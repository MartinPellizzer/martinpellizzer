                    <h1>Orobanche sanguinea f. ischiae</h1>
<p>Orobanche sanguinea f. ischiae, commonly known as the Ischian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on the presence of specific host roots, and it produces small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
