                    <h1>Opuntia arbuscula var. congesta</h1>
<p>Opuntia arbuscula var. congesta, commonly known as the dense-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are used for photosynthesis and water storage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its deep root system.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
