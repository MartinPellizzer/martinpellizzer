<p>Oreogrammitis frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic hair-crisp, is a rare and hardy moss that thrives in extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, wiry stems and small, overlapping leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. This plant is typically found in high-altitude and polar regions where temperatures remain consistently low. Oreogrammitis frigida has a unique ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh wind conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of pristine, untouched ecosystems in extreme climates.</p>
