<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>mandalyana, commonly known as the Argolic Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southern regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
