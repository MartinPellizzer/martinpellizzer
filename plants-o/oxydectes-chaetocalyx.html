                    <h1>Oxydectes chaetocalyx</h1>
<p>Oxydectes chaetocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
