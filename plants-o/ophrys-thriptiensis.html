<p>Ophrys thriptiensis, commonly known as the Thrace bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Europe, particularly in regions of Greece and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female wasp, a mimicry strategy used to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the wasp mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys thriptiensis is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction.</p>
