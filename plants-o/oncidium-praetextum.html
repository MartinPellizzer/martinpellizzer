<p>Oncidium praetextum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often multicolored flowers that feature intricate patterns and contrasting hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods, and it produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Oncidium praetextum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
