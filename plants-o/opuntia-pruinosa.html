                    <h1>Opuntia pruinosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in a whitish, powdery coating called pruina. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection.</p>
<p>Opuntia pruinosa is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
