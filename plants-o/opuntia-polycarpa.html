                    <h1>Opuntia polycarpa</h1>
<p>Opuntia polycarpa, commonly known as the tree cactus or Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia polycarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</p>
