<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>pseudospeculum, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow hue and a complex, bee-like labellum. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and heaths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
