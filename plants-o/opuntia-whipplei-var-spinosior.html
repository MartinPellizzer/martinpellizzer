                    <h1>Opuntia whipplei var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Opuntia whipplei var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spine-tipped pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface. Its spines, which are modified leaves, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine.</p>
