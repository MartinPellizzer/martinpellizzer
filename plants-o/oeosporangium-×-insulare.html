                    <h1>Oeosporangium × insulare</h1>
<p>Oeosporangium × insulare, commonly known as the hybrid mangrove, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Kandelia candel* and *Bruguiera gymnorrhiza*.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a unique root system that allows it to thrive in saline and waterlogged environments. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by water. Its morphology includes thick, fibrous roots and a dense, bushy canopy, typical of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>This hybrid plays a vital role in coastal protection and habitat provision for marine and terrestrial life.</p>
