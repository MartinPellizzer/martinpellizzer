                    <h1>Ophrys × sansimonensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sansimonensis, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly in regions like France and Italy. The plant is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles female wasps, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that mimics the pheromones of its pollinators.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sansimonensis is valued for its ecological role and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific interest.</p>
