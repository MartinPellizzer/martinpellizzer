                    <h1>Orchis rhenana</h1>
<p>Orchis rhenana, commonly known as the Rhine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, particularly found in moist, calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect stem bearing a spike of flowers. Orchis rhenana is a protected species in many European countries due to its declining populations and specific habitat requirements.</p>
<p>Its pollination is primarily carried out by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
