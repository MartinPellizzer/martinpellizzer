<p>Opuntia echinocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid environments, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Opuntia echinocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in cuisine and medicine.</p>
