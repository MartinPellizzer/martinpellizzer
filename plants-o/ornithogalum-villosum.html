<p>Ornithogalum villosum, commonly known as the woolly star-of-Bethleham, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, stocky stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its underground bulb is an important storage organ that allows it to survive dry periods.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum villosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats.</p>
