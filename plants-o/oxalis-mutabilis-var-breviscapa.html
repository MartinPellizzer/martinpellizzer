<p>Oxalis mutabilis var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its stems are short and sprawling, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
