                    <h1>Odontochilus platysepalus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus platysepalus, commonly known as the flat-sepal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive, flat, elongated sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
