<p>Orobanche hirtiflora subsp.</p>
<p>zosimii, commonly known as the Hairy Broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its lack of foliage. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
