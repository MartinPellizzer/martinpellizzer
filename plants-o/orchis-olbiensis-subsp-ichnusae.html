<p>Orchis olbiensis subsp.</p>
<p>ichnusae, commonly known as the Ichnusae orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Balkans. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its habitat is often restricted to moist, calcareous soils in forested or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
