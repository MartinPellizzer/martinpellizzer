                    <h1>Oxalis bahiensis</h1>
<p>Oxalis bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces elaiosomes on its seeds, which are often dispersed by ants, aiding in its propagation. Oxalis bahiensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions as a garden plant.</p>
