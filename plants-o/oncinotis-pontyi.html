<p>Oncinotis pontyi, commonly known as the Pontic water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Oncinotis pontyi plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
