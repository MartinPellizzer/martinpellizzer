<p>Orobanche eryngiophya, commonly known as the thistle broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It typically parasitizes plants in the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and other related species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
