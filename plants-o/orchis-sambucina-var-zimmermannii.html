<p>Orchis sambucina var. zimmermannii, commonly known as the Zimmermann's orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
