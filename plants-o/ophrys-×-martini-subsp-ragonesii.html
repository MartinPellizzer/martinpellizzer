<p>Ophrys × martini subsp.</p>
<p>ragonesii, commonly known as the ragonesii orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes a distinctive labellum that mimics female bees, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
