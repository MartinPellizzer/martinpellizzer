<p>Orobanche crassistyla, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
