                    <h1>Ottelia sinensis</h1>
<p>Ottelia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. The plant features floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive blue or purple hue.</p>
<p>Ottelia sinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
