<p>Oenothera pallida var. typica, commonly known as the pale evening primrose, is a striking member of the Onagraceae family. This plant is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is recognized for its large, showy yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Its unique flowering pattern and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
