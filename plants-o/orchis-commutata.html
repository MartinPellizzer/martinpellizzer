                    <h1>Orchis commutata</h1>
<p>Orchis commutata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Orchis commutata is notable for its lack of showy petals, with its reproductive structures being more subtle and adapted for specific pollination mechanisms.</p>
