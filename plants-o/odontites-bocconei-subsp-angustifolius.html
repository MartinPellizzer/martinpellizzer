<p>Odontites bocconei subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toothed violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the main species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers with five petals, arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
