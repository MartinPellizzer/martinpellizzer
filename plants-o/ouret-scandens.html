<p>Ouret scandens, commonly known as the climbing pomegranate, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and twine around supports. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits similar to pomegranates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Ouret scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
