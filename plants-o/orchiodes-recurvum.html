                    <h1>Orchiodes recurvum</h1>
<p>Orchiodes recurvum, commonly known as the recurved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors including purple, yellow, and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
