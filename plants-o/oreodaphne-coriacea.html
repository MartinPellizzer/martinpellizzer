                    <h1>Oreodaphne coriacea</h1>
<p>Oreodaphne coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leafed daphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Oreodaphne coriacea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species.</p>
