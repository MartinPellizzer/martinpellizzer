<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>proxima, commonly known as the Lesser Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils in open woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
