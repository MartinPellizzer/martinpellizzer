<p>Ophrys exaltata subsp.</p>
<p>splendida, commonly known as the Splendid Bee Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with a distinctive dark central patch.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its rarity and is considered a protected species in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
