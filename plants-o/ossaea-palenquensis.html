<p>Ossaea palenquensis, commonly known as the Palenque ossaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it exhibits some unique floral characteristics. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ossaea palenquensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
