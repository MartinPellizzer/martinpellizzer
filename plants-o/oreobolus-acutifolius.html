<p>Oreobolus acutifolius, commonly known as the sharpleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland plains. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Oreobolus acutifolius is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
