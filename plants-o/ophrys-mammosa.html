                    <h1>Ophrys mammosa</h1>
<p>Ophrys mammosa, commonly known as the milk-vein orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bee-mimicking flowers. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green blooms with a distinctive central "lip" that resembles a female bee, aiding in pollination by male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Ophrys mammosa is a protected species in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
