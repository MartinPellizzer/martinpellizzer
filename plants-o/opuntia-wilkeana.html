<p>Opuntia wilkeana, commonly known as the Wilke's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which bear both spines and flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia wilkeana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
