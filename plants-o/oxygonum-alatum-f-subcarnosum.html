                    <h1>Oxygonum alatum f. subcarnosum</h1>
<p>Oxygonum alatum f. subcarnosum, commonly known as the winged spurge, is a variant of the winged spurge species native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its distinctive, flattened, wing-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with a pale underside, and the plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
