<p>Ophrys holosericea psp.</p>
<p>bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of its pollinator.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
