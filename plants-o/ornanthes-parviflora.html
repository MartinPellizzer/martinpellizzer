                    <h1>Ornanthes parviflora</h1>
<p>Ornanthes parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Ornanthes parviflora is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions.</p>
