                    <h1>Orchis keiskei</h1>
<p>Orchis keiskei, commonly known as the Keiske's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy violet-blue flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchis keiskei is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
