<p>Oberonia rimachila, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Oberonia rimachila is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
