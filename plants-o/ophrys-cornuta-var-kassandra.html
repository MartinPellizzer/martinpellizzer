                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. kassandra</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. kassandra, commonly known as the Kassandra bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single or few flowers per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
