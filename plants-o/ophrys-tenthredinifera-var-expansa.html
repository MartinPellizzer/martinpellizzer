                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. expansa</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-winged bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
