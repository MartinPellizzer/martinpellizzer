<p>Onobrychis pindicola subsp.</p>
<p>pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
