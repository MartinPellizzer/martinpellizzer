<p>Oligochaetochilus insectifer, commonly known as the insect-bearing thread moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Oligochaetochilus insectifer is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common component of temperate and tropical ecosystems.</p>
