<p>Orchis fuciflora, commonly known as the black helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers that are often overlooked due to their muted color. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded woodland habitats. It has a complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Orchis fuciflora is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption and contribute to its ecological significance.</p>
