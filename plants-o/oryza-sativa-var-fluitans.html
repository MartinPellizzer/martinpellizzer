                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rice, is a unique variant of rice that grows entirely in water.</p>
<p>This aquatic plant has roots that float on the surface of the water, allowing it to thrive in flooded rice paddies. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, adapted to the wet environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom above the water, followed by the development of rice grains.</p>
<p>It is an important crop in certain regions of Southeast Asia where it is cultivated for its yield and adaptability to wet conditions.</p>
