                    <h1>Oxytropis tschuktschorum</h1>
<p>Oxytropis tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
