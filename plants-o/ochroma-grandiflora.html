                    <h1>Ochroma grandiflora</h1>
<p>Ochroma grandiflora, commonly known as the trumpet tree or balsa tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters. Its lightweight, porous wood is highly valued for its use in model building and as a material for insulation.</p>
<p>The tree also produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its propagation in natural habitats.</p>
