                    <h1>Orobanche acaulis</h1>
<p>Orobanche acaulis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various species within the family Fabaceae. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, and it can significantly impact crop growth.</p>
