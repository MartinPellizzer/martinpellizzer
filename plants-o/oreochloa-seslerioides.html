<p>Oreochloa seslerioides, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Oreochloa seslerioides plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
