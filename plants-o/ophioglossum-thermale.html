<p>Ophioglossum thermale, commonly known as the thermal adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporangium and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, upright rhizome and a single, bipinnate leaf. It is often associated with geothermal areas due to its preference for warm, humid microclimates.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum thermale is of particular interest to botanists due to its primitive features and limited distribution.</p>
