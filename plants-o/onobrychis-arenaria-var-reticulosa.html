                    <h1>Onobrychis arenaria var. reticulosa</h1>
<p>Onobrychis arenaria var. reticulosa, commonly known as the reticulate field vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
