                    <h1>Okenia</h1>
<p>Okenia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. Okenia species are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to their unique adaptations, they are of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant resilience in harsh environments.</p>
