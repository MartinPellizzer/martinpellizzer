                    <h1>Ophelia porrigens</h1>
<p>Ophelia porrigens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Ophelia porrigens plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
