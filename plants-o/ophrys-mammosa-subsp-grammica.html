<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>grammica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinct, hairy lip that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
