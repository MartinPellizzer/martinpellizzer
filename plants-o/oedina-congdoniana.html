                    <h1>Oedina congdoniana</h1>
<p>Oedina congdoniana, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oedina congdoniana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
