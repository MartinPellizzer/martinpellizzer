<p>Ophrys cornuta var. masticorum, commonly known as the Mastic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex, lip-like structure that mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, sunny habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
