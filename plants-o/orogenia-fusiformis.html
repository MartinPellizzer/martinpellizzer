                    <h1>Orogenia fusiformis</h1>
<p>Orogenia fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain lichen, is a unique species found in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, forming a composite structure known as a lichen. The plant exhibits a thallus that is typically flattened and leaf-like, with a distinct, elongated shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it plays an important role in nutrient cycling in alpine ecosystems.</p>
