                    <h1>Orobanche inexspectata</h1>
<p>Orobanche inexspectata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, which are often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, influencing both plant communities and soil nutrient dynamics.</p>
