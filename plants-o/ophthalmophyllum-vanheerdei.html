                    <h1>Ophthalmophyllum vanheerdei</h1>
<p>Ophthalmophyllum vanheerdei, commonly known as the eye-plant, is a rare and unique member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, eye-like floral structures that are both visually distinctive and biologically specialized. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Its native habitat is limited to a few isolated regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
