<p>Ochyrorchis godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, slender petals and a striking, translucent floral structure. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically pale green with a deep violet or purple lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
