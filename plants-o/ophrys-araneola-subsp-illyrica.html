<p>Ophrys araneola subsp.</p>
<p>illyrica, commonly known as the Ilyrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans.

<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates with moderate moisture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow hue with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
