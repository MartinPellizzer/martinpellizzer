                    <h1>Ophioglossum felixii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum felixii, commonly known as the golden harts, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium clusters, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the leaf margins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum felixii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
