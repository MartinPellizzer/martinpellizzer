                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. hasskarlii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. hasskarlii, commonly known as the Indian wild rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered spikelets that contain the reproductive structures. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, cylindrical stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that develop into grains, which are similar in structure to those of cultivated rice.</p>
