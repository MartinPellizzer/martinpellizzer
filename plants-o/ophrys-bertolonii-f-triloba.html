                    <h1>Ophrys bertolonii f. triloba</h1>
<p>Ophrys bertolonii f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces striking, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
