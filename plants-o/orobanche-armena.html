                    <h1>Orobanche armena</h1>
<p>Orobanche armena, commonly known as the Armenian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to reddish flowers, which are typically short-lived. It is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing on hosts such as legumes and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
