                    <h1>Orobanche verticillata</h1>
<p>Orobanche verticillata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and depends entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny, pink to purple flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield.</p>
