                    <h1>Ophelia zeylanica</h1>
<p>Ophelia zeylanica, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize aquatic habitats effectively.</p>
<p>Ophelia zeylanica plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
