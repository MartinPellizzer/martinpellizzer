<p>Ophrys suboccidentalis subsp.</p>
<p>olonae, commonly known as the Western bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats. It has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
