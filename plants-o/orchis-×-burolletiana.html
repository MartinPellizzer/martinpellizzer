<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>This hybrid is notable for its genetic variability and is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically.</p>
