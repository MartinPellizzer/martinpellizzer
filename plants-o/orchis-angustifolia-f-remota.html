<p>Orchis angustifolia f. remota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, pale purple to white flowers with a yellowish lip. This form is a natural variant of Orchis angustifolia, distinguished by its more elongated leaves and reduced floral structures. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or heathland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
