<p>Ophrys exaltata subsp.</p>
<p>montis-leonis, commonly known as the Alpine Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid found in alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open mountainous areas. Its floral structure is highly adapted for mimicry, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that enhance its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
