                    <h1>Odontosoria aculeata</h1>
<p>Odontosoria aculeata, commonly known as the spiny spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with tiny, spiny projections along the margins. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to its substrate and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Odontosoria aculeata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
