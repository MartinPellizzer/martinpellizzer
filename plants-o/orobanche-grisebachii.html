                    <h1>Orobanche grisebachii</h1>
<p>Orobanche grisebachii, commonly known as the gray broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Orobanche grisebachii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
