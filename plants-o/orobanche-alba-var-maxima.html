                    <h1>Orobanche alba var. maxima</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba var. maxima, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
