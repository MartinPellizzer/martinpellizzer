<p>Ophrys × specularia, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Ophrys genus in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. Its flowers typically feature a vivid yellow and brown coloration with a distinctive "face" that resembles an insect, enhancing its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × specularia is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
