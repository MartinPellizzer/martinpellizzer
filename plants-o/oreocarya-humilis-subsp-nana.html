<p>Oreocarya humilis subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as the dwarf oreocarya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
