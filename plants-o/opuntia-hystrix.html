                    <h1>Opuntia hystrix</h1>
<p>Opuntia hystrix, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia hystrix is also known for its ability to propagate through offshoots, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>
