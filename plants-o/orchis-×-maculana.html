                    <h1>Orchis × maculana</h1>
<p>Orchis × maculana, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the early purple orchid (Orchis mascula) and the common twayblade (Neotinea borealis).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers, often with a distinctive brownish spot on the lower lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The spotted orchid is protected in many regions due to its declining populations and is considered a rare and valuable component of the UK's flora.</p>
