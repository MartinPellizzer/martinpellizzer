                    <h1>Ozanonia vestita</h1>
<p>Ozanonia vestita, commonly known as the smooth bryum, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, greenish-gray shoots and small, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and not ribbed. The plant produces elongated capsules that are often covered in a thin, transparent calyptra. Ozanonia vestita is commonly found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and adaptability make it a common component of temperate and boreal ecosystems.</p>
