                    <h1>Opuntia pennellii</h1>
<p>Opuntia pennellii, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia pennellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
