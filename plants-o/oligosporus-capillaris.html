                    <h1>Oligosporus capillaris</h1>
<p>Oligosporus capillaris, commonly known as the slender spore grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its wide distribution. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Oligosporus capillaris is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
