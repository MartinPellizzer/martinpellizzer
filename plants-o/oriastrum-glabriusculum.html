<p>Oriastrum glabriusculum, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Oriastrum glabriusculum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
