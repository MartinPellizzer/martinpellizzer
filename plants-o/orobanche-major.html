                    <h1>Orobanche major</h1>
<p>Orobanche major, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root contact with host plants for sustenance. The plant produces showy, often brightly colored flowers that can range from white to purple or red. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is a significant pest in agricultural settings, particularly in crops like wheat and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause substantial yield loss in infected fields.</p>
