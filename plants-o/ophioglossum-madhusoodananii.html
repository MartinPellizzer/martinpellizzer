                    <h1>Ophioglossum madhusoodananii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum madhusoodananii, commonly known as the Madhusoodananâ€™s adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, characterized by its primitive morphology and unique reproductive structures. The plant features a short, erect rhizome with a single, elongated, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two lobes. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base of the leaf, a feature that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
