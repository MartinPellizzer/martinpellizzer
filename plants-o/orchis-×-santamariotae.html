<p>Orchis × santamariotae, commonly known as the Santamaria orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropopogon.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a cluster of lip-shaped petals that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
