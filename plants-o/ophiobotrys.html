                    <h1>Ophiobotrys</h1>
<p>Ophiobotrys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ophiobotrys is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments like cypress swamps.</p>
