                    <h1>Onixotis stricta</h1>
<p>Onixotis stricta, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
