                    <h1>Ophrys bertolonii var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys bertolonii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
