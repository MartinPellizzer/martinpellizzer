                    <h1>Ossaea heterotricha</h1>
<p>Ossaea heterotricha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. Ossaea heterotricha is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can enter dormancy during periods of extreme drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
