                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. kpelleana</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. kpelleana, commonly known as the Kpelleana rice variety, is a traditional African rice species native to the savannas of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, narrow leaves, and grains that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to other rice varieties. This variety is adapted to low-input agricultural systems and can thrive in diverse soil conditions, making it resilient to environmental stress. Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader understanding of rice evolution and adaptation.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture and food security in local communities.</p>
