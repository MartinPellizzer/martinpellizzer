                    <h1>Olea chrysophylla var. nubica</h1>
<p>Olea chrysophylla var. nubica, commonly known as the cloud olive, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the olive tree.</p>
<p>It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are yellow-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits similar to those of the common olive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
