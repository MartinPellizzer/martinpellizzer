                    <h1>Ophrys bilunulata</h1>
<p>Ophrys bilunulata, commonly known as the two-lobed helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its distinctive, complex floral structure. The flower has a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
