<p>Orchis picta subsp.</p>
<p>libani, commonly known as the Lebanon painted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive white markings, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained environments, while its tall, erect stems support its ornate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
