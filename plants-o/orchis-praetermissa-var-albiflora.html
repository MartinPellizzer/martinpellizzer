<p>Orchis praetermissa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, often in acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced foliage and specialized pollination mechanisms, which are characteristic of many orchid species.</p>
