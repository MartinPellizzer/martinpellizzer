                    <h1>Orobanche littoralis</h1>
<p>Orobanche littoralis, commonly known as the coastal broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of Europe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems, influencing both plant community dynamics and soil nutrient cycles.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of specific environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
