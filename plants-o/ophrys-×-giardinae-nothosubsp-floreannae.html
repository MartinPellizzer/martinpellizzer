<p>Ophrys × giardinae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>floreannae, commonly known as the Floreana orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a complex genetic background, resulting from crosses between Ophrys giardinae and other Ophrys species, leading to a range of morphological variations.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its intricate flower structure, which mimics female insects to attract male pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation. It thrives in specific habitats, typically in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and conservation studies.</p>
