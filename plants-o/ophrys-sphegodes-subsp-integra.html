<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>integra, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape that mimics a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The subspecies integra is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes.</p>
