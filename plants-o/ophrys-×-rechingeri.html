                    <h1>Ophrys × rechingeri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × rechingeri, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical traits.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their mimicry of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant features a striking inflorescence with flowers that closely resemble female insects, a characteristic known as pseudocopulation. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while the stem is unbranched and typically grows to a height of about 30 cm.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats across Europe.</p>
