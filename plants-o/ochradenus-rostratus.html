<p>Ochradenus rostratus, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces yellowish or greenish flowers in clusters. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ochradenus rostratus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
