                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza insularis</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza insularis, commonly known as the island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows on trees and shrubs, forming dense clusters that can dominate the canopy in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophiorrhiza insularis is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
