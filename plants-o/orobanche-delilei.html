<p>Orobanche delilei, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
