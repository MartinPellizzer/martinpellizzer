<p>Ophrys carmeli subsp.</p>
<p>rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
