                    <h1>Orobanche pubescens var. campuliflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche pubescens var. campuliflora, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its small, scale-like leaves are reduced, and it produces numerous small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing host plant populations and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
