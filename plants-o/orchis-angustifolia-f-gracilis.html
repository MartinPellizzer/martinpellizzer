<p>Orchis angustifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility, it is often protected in its natural environment.</p>
