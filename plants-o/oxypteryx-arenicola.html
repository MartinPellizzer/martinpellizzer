<p>Oxypteryx arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rocky surfaces or sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Its morphology is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Oxypteryx arenicola plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing microhabitats for other organisms and preventing soil erosion.</p>
