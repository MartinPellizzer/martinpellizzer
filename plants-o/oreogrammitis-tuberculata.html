                    <h1>Oreogrammitis tuberculata</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate chain fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tuberculate (bumpy) fronds that give it a rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
