                    <h1>Opuntia brachyclada</h1>
<p>Opuntia brachyclada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia brachyclada is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
