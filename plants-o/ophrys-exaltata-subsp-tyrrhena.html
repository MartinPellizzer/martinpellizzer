<p>Ophrys exaltata subsp.</p>
<p>tyrrhena, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
