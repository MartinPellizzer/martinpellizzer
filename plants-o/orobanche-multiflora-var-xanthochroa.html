                    <h1>Orobanche multiflora var. xanthochroa</h1>
<p>Orobanche multiflora var. xanthochroa, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
