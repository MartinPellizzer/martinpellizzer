                    <h1>Orobanche ludoviciana var. valida</h1>
<p>Orobanche ludoviciana var. valida, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically parasitizes various species of legumes and other herbaceous plants, forming a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
