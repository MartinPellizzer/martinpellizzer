<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, swollen labellum that resembles a bee's abdomen. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs later in the season compared to other Ophrys species, hence its common name.</p>
