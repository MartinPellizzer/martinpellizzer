<p>Oxyrhynchus insularis, commonly known as the island oxyrhynchus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxyrhynchus insularis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
