<p>Opuntia missouriensis f. albispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear with white spines, is a succulent cactus native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in white, soft spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
