                    <h1>Oberna commutata</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Obernna commutata, commonly known as the common fern moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a central midrib and delicate, branching leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. It is often found growing on rocks or in forest floors, thriving in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology reflects its early evolutionary position among bryophytes.</p>
