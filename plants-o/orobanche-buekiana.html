                    <h1>Orobanche buekiana</h1>
<p>Orobanche buekiana, commonly known as the Buek's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots. The plant produces small, often reddish or yellowish flowers, typically in clusters. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
