                    <h1>Ophrys tetuanensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized lip that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
