                    <h1>Orobanche uniflora var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Orobanche uniflora var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of western North America. Its life cycle involves germinating in the presence of host roots and forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
