<p>Ostryopsis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate osier, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Ostryopsis intermedia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in wet or moist soil conditions.</p>
