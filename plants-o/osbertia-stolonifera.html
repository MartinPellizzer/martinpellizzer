                    <h1>Osbertia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Osbertia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping osbertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and often have a pale blue or purple hue.</p>
<p>Osbertia stolonifera is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
