<p>Oxalis cajanifolia, commonly known as the evergreen wood sorrel, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, though it is a woody shrub rather than a herb. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Oxalis cajanifolia is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
