                <h1>Orobanche gracilis</h1>
<p>Orobanche gracilis, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly affect the growth of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some regions, though it also has ecological and potential medicinal significance.</p>
