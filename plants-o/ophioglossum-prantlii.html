                    <h1>Ophioglossum prantlii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum prantlii, commonly known as the Indian adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, erect stem and a single, broad, lanceolate leaf. Its reproductive structures are positioned on the underside of the leaf, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum prantlii is considered a living fossil due to its primitive features and limited geographic distribution.</p>
