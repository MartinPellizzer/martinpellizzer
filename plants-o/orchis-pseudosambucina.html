                    <h1>Orchis pseudosambucina</h1>
<p>Orchis pseudosambucina, commonly known as the false elder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of pale purple to pinkish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other insect pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare and is often protected in its natural habitats due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
