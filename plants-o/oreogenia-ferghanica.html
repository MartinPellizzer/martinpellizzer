                    <h1>Oreogenia ferghanica</h1>
<p>Oreogenia ferghanica, commonly known as the Ferghana mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogenia ferghanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
