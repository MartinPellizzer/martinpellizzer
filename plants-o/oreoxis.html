                    <h1>Oreoxis</h1>
<p>Oreoxis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Oreoxis species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens with well-draining conditions.</p>
