                    <h1>Osmia polyantha</h1>
<p>Osmia polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese orchid bee, is a species of solitary bee native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic blue or green body and is often found in forested areas. The plant is not a true plant but a type of bee, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. However, it plays an important role in pollination, particularly for orchids and other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, biodiverse ecosystems.</p>
