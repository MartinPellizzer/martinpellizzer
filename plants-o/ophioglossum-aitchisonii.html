                    <h1>Ophioglossum aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is distinctive among ferns. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect, leaf-like structure that is typically green and glabrous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
