                    <h1>Oxalis comosa</h1>
<p>Oxalis comosa, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense, low-growing mats.</p>
