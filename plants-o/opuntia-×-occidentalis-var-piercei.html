                    <h1>Opuntia × occidentalis var. piercei</h1>
<p>Opuntia × occidentalis var. piercei, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a hybrid species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are modified leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Its areoles, which are clusters of spines, hairs, and flowers, are a defining feature of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Opuntia × occidentalis var. piercei is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
