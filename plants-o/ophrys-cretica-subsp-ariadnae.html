<p>Ophrys cretica subsp.</p>
<p>ariadnae, commonly known as the Adriatic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
