                    <h1>Ophrys × delamainii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × delamainii, commonly known as the Delamain's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open woodland or grassland habitats across southern Europe. It produces erect spikes of flowers with intricate patterns and a strong floral odor.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
