<p>Odontoglossum lunatum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, moon-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with dark purple veins. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Odontoglossum lunatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions.</p>
