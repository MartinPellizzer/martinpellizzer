                    <h1>Oxyanthus speciosus var. glaber</h1>
<p>Oxyanthus speciosus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth oxyanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished from other oxyanthus species by its reduced pubescence and specific floral morphology.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded undergrowth in humid forests.</p>
