                    <h1>Ophrys × sieberi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sieberi, commonly known as the sieber's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, sweet scent that mimics the aroma of bees to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulatory structure.</p>
