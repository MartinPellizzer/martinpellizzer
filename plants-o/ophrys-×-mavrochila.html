                    <h1>Ophrys × mavrochila</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mavrochila, commonly known as the black-horned orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys scrobiculata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like appearance, with a dark brown, hooded labellum that mimics the shape and color of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in regions with mild, moist climates. Its flowers are highly specialized for pseudocopulation, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's deceptive structure.</p>
<p>Ophrys × mavrochila is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe.</p>
