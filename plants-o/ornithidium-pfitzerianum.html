                    <h1>Ornithidium pfitzerianum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium pfitzerianum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are dimorphic, with sterile fronds being shorter and more compact than the fertile ones.</p>
<p>Ornithidium pfitzerianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
