<p>Oberonia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves that are broad and ovate. The plant produces a single, racemose inflorescence with small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Oberonia spathulata is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories.</p>
