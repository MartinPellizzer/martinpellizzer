                    <h1>Ophrys inzengae</h1>
<p>Ophrys inzengae, commonly known as the Inzeng's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns mimicking bee anatomy. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys inzengae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
