<p>Oncidium pollardii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, butterfly-like flowers that are typically yellow with green or purple markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncidium pollardii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
