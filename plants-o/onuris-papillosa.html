                    <h1>Onuris papillosa</h1>
<p>Onuris papillosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection.</p>
<p>Onuris papillosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival.</p>
