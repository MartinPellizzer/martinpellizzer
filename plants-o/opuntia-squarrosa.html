<p>Opuntia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which are fine, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia squarrosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
