<p>Oxytropis viscidula subsp.</p>
<p>sulphurea, commonly known as sulphur hill clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are viscid, meaning they have a sticky surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its sulfur-yellow flowers, which give it its common name and contribute to its ecological role in pollinator habitats.</p>
