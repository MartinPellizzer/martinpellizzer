                    <h1>Ophrys × grampinii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × grampinii, commonly known as the Grampian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is native to the Scottish Highlands and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded woodlands and has a short, upright stem with a single, showy flower. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys × grampinii is a rare and protected plant, highlighting the unique adaptations of orchids in their ecological niches.</p>
