                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera f. elongata</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera f. elongata, commonly known as the long-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its elongated floral bracts and pale yellow to greenish-brown coloration are key botanical features.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
