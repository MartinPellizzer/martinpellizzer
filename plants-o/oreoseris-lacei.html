<p>Oreoseris lacei, commonly known as the lacey oreoseris, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Oreoseris lacei is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat, making it an interesting subject for ecological studies.</p>
