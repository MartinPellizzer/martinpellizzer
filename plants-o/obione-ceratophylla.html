                    <h1>Obione ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Obione ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned waterwheel, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. The plant's leaves are narrow and spirally twisted, giving it a helical appearance that aids in maximizing light absorption. Its reproductive structures consist of small, floating fruits that release seeds into the water, facilitating dispersal.</p>
<p>Obione ceratophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
