<p>Oyedaea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, palm-like leaves that are obovate in shape. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Oyedaea obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
