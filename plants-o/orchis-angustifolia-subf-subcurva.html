<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>subcurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients, lacking chlorophyll. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heaths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
