<p>Ophrys dyris f. albina, commonly known as the white bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
