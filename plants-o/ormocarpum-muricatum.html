<p>Ormocarpum muricatum, commonly known as the "spiny apple" or "huito," is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often woody and branched.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, though its spiny exterior makes it challenging to harvest and consume.</p>
