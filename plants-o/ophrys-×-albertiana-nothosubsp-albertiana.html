<p>Ophrys × albertiana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>albertiana, commonly known as the Albertian bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and green hues, with a distinctive lip that resembles a wasp's abdomen.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits intermediate traits between its parent species, showcasing the genetic diversity of orchid hybrids.</p>
