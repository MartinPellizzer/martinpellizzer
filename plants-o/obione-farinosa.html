                    <h1>Obione farinosa</h1>
<p>Obione farinosa, commonly known as the dusty milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water.</p>
<p>Obione farinosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
