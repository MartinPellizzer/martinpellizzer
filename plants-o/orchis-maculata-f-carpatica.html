<p>Orchis maculata f. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white spotted flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
