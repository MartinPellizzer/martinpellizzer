                    <h1>Owenia capitis-yorki</h1>
<p>Owenia capitis-yorki, commonly known as the York Island mangrove, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in its saline habitat, and its roots form a complex network that stabilizes the soil and prevents erosion. Owenia capitis-yorki produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds into the surrounding water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
