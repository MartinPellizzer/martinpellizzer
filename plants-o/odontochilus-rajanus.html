                    <h1>Odontochilus rajanus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus rajanus, commonly known as the Rajan's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are often greenish or pale yellow in color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
