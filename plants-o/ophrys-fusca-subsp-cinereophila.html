<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>cinereophila, commonly known as the ash-colored bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are predominantly brown or ash-gray in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
