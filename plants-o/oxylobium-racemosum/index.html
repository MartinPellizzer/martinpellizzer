                            <h1>Oxylobium Racemosum</h1>
<p>Oxylobium racemosum is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States. It is known for its unique appearance, featuring clusters of violet and white flowers that bloom in late spring. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid environments. Its limited distribution makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Protecting Oxylobium racemosum is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
