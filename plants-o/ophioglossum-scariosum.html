                    <h1>Ophioglossum scariosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum scariosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaf. Ophioglossum scariosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
