                    <h1>Otachyrium pterigodium</h1>
<p>Otachyrium pterigodium, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble feathers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
