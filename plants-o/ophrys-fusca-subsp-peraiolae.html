<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>peraiolae, commonly known as the Peraiolae bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and riverbanks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking purple and yellow flowers that are highly attractive to male bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations.</p>
