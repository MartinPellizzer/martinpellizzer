<p>Oligoglossa acicularis, commonly known as the slender-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It is native to parts of Australia and is often found in eucalyptus forests.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
