<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in mountainous and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
