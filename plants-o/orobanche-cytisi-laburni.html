                    <h1>Orobanche cytisi-laburni</h1>
<p>Orobanche cytisi-laburni, commonly known as the laburnum broom orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically parasitizes plants in the Fabaceae family, such as laburnum and broom. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that resemble those of its host. It is found in Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
