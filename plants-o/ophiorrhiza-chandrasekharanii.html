<p>Ophiorrhiza chandrasekharanii, commonly known as Chandrasekharan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Western Ghats of India and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers. This species typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>
