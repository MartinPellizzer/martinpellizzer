                    <h1>Oncidium sepula</h1>
<p>Oncidium sepula, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Oncidium sepula typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies.</p>
