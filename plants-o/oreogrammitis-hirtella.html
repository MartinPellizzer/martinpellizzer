                    <h1>Oreogrammitis hirtella</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. The plant has a distinctive appearance with finely divided, hirsute fronds that give it a soft, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis hirtella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
