                    <h1>Orobanche procera</h1>
<p>Orobanche procera, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and other herbaceous plants. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
