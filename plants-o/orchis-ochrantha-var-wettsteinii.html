<p>Orchis ochrantha var. wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's early purple orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has a short lifespan, with the flower spike often dying back after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
