                    <h1>Opuntia compressa</h1>
<p>Opuntia compressa, commonly known as the flat prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Opuntia compressa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
