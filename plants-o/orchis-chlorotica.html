<p>Orchis chlorotica, commonly known as the green orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid greenish-yellow flowers, which are unique among orchids for their coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis chlorotica is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
