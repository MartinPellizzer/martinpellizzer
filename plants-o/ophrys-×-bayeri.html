                    <h1>Ophrys × bayeri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × bayeri, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their mimicry of female wasps. The plant produces striking, wasp-like flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. These flowers are specialized structures with a labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female wasp to attract male wasps.</p>
<p>Ophrys × bayeri is typically found in moist, shaded environments across parts of Europe, where it thrives in woodland and meadow habitats.</p>
