                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. atropos</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. atropos, commonly known as the black-faced bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like appearance that serves as a mimicry mechanism to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, almost black, upper lip that resembles a bee's face. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in calcareous soils within woodland or heathland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
