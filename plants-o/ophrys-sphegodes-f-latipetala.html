                    <h1>Ophrys sphegodes f. latipetala</h1>
<p>Ophrys sphegodes f. latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a broad, petal-like labellum that resembles an insect. Its leaves are dark green and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
