<p>Ophrys caffra, commonly known as the Cape bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, which is a result of evolutionary adaptations for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. Its flowers have a specialized structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys caffra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
