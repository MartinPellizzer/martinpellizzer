<p>Oreocereus irigoyenii, commonly known as the Irigoyen's candelabra cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that branches into a candelabra-like structure, supporting numerous white flowers. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
