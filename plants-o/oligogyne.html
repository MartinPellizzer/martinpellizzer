                    <h1>Oligogyne</h1>
<p>Oligogyne, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "lady's mantle," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. Oligogyne species are typically found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. The leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture.</p>
<p>They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
