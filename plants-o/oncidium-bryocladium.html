<p>Oncidium bryocladium, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
