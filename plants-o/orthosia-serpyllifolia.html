<p>Orthosia serpyllifolia, commonly known as field penny-cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June, depending on the climate. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist or slightly shaded environments.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, winged seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
