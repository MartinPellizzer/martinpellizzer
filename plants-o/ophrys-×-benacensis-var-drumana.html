                    <h1>Ophrys × benacensis var. drumana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × benacensis var. drumana, commonly known as the Drumana bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctive, bee-like shape that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its role in ecological interactions, particularly in facilitating pollination through its deceptive floral structure.</p>
