                            <h1>Oenothera Hookeri Subsp. Hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Hooker's hairy evening primrose, scientifically known as Oenothera hookeri subsp. hirsutissima, is a unique and striking member of the evening primrose family native to the western United States. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom at dusk. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators. Its resilience and beauty make it a valuable subject for both botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
