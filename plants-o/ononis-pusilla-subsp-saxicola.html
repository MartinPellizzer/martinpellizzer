<p>Ononis pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to rocky and gravelly habitats in the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs, rock crevices, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
