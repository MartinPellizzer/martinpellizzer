                    <h1>Ophrys × japygia</h1>
<p>Ophrys × japygia, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parent species. The flower structure is highly specialized, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This mimicry is a key adaptation in its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and heathland habitats across Europe.</p>
