                    <h1>Opuntia pyrrhantha</h1>
<p>Opuntia pyrrhantha, commonly known as the red-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and typically turns from green to yellow or red as it matures.</p>
<p>Opuntia pyrrhantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny exterior.</p>
