                <h1>Orobanche minor</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, slender stem with no true leaves. It typically parasitizes crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
