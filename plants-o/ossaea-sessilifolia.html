<p>Ossaea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. Its morphology is characterized by a crust-like thallus with tightly adhering lobes and a dark, often black or brown, coloration.</p>
<p>Ossaea sessilifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
