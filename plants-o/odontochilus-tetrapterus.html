                    <h1>Odontochilus tetrapterus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus tetrapterus, commonly known as the four-winged toothed orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on its leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
