<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>janrenzii, commonly known as the Jan Renz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctively shaped column and a short, narrow spur.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique evolutionary adaptations.</p>
