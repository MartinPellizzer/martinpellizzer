                    <h1>Opuntia ursina</h1>
<p>Opuntia ursina, commonly known as the bear's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Opuntia ursina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert species.</p>
