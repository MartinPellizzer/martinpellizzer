<p>Oenanthe gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are finely divided with a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Oenanthe gallaecica is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological adaptations to wetland environments.</p>
