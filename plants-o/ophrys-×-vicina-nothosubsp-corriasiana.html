<p>Ophrys × vicina nothosubsp.</p>
<p>corriasiana, commonly known as the Corriasian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its specialized floral morphology, including a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Italy and Greece. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green hues, contributing to its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
