<p>Ophiorrhiza pulgarensis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the family Euphorbiaceae, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza pulgarensis is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
