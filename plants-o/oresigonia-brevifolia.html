                    <h1>Oresigonia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Oresigonia brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf oresigonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Oresigonia brevifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-elevation habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
