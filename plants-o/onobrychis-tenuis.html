<p>Onobrychis tenuis, commonly known as slender burr medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, curved burrs that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
