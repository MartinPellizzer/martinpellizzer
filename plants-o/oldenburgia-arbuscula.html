<p>Oldenburgia arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its deep root system allows it to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it well-adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities.</p>
