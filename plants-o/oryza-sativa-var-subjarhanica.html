                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. subjarhanica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. subjarhanica, commonly known as the subjarhanica rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated rice subspecies native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short grain and high amylose content, which contributes to its firm texture when cooked. This variety is often used in traditional cuisines for its distinct flavor and aroma. Botanically, it exhibits typical rice morphology with a fibrous husk and a single seed per grain.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup is closely related to other rice varieties, making it a subject of interest for agricultural research.</p>
