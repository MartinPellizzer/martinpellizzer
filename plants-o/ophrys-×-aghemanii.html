                    <h1>Ophrys × aghemanii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × aghemanii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Greece and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × aghemanii thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
