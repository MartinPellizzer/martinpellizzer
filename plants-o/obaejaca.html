                    <h1>Obaejaca</h1>
<p>Obaejaca, commonly known as the "Amazonian giant water lily," is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enormous, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life forms. The plant's floating leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help it stay buoyant in still water. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are typically white or pale pink and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Obaejaca plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native environment.</p>
