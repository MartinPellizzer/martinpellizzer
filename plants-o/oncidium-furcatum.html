                    <h1>Oncidium furcatum</h1>
<p>Oncidium furcatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin, and often curved stems, which can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a popular subject in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
