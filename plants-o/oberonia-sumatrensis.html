<p>Oberonia sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oberonia sumatrensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
