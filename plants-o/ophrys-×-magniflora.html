<p>Ophrys × magniflora, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits remarkable botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that closely resemble female bees, a trait known as mimicry, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and white, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect.</p>
<p>Ophrys × magniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a significant role in ecological systems through its pollination interactions.</p>
