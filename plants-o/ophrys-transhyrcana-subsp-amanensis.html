<p>Ophrys transhyrcana subsp.</p>
<p>amanensis, commonly known as the Aman's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive coloration and intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils in dry, mountainous regions, often in areas with limited vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
