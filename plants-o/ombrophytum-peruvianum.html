                    <h1>Ombrophytum peruvianum</h1>
<p>Ombrophytum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian mossy orchid, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, moss-like appearance, which helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas where it can receive indirect light and maintain high moisture levels. Its leaves are dense and velvety, often covered in a fine, moss-like coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ombrophytum peruvianum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
