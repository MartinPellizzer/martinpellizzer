                    <h1>Orobanche epithymum var. origani</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymum var. origani, commonly known as the Greek dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with leguminous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it has limited morphological features, with reduced leaves and a highly specialized root system for attaching to hosts.</p>
