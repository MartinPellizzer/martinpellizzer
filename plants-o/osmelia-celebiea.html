<p>Osmelia celebiea, commonly known as the Celebes osmunda, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Celebes in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in shallow waters. Its spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal to new habitats.</p>
<p>Osmelia celebiea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
