                    <h1>Orobanche angustelaciniata</h1>
<p>Orobanche angustelaciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like cluster. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing plants such as shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
