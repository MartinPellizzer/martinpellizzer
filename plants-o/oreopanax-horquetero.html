<p>Oreopanax horquetero, commonly known as the Horquetero or Quetzalcoatl's tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often palmately arranged with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oreopanax horquetero is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
