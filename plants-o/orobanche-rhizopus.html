<p>Orobanche rhizopus, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow to reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are often white or pink in color. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, typically growing in disturbed soils or on cultivated crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops such as cereals and legumes.</p>
