                    <h1>Ophrys × pacis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pacis, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. Its flowers are typically yellow with dark markings, and they emit a scent that further enhances their mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × pacis is often found in calcareous grasslands and is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
