<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>benacensis, commonly known as the Benaco Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Dolomites of northern Italy. It is characterized by its strikingly mimicry-like flowers, which resemble female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex structure featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
