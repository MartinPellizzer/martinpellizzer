                    <h1>Orobanche gypsogena</h1>
<p>Orobanche gypsogena, commonly known as the gypsum witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often growing in association with leguminous plants. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale pink or yellow in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in the presence of host roots and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops in its native habitats.</p>
