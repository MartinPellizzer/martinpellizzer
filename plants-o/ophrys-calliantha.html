<p>Ophrys calliantha, commonly known as the greater  bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, during which it produces clusters of flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Ophrys calliantha are closely adapted to its unique pollination strategy, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-animal interactions.</p>
