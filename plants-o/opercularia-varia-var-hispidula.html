                    <h1>Opercularia varia var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Opercularia varia var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy structures known as rhizines. The lichen forms a dark, leathery crust on its substrate, often growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in lichenology.</p>
