                    <h1>Orobanche cernua f. taurica</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua f. taurica, commonly known as the tauric broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as vetch and clover. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a connection through specialized haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
