<p>Orchis incarnata var. incisiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiraled inflorescence of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing along stream banks or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Orchis incarnata.</p>
