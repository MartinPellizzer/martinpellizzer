<p>Oxalis reptans, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats over the soil.</p>
<p>Oxalis reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to enrich soil with its nitrogen-fixing properties.</p>
