<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>lunulata, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale yellow to greenish hue, featuring intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
