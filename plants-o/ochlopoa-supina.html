                    <h1>Ochlopoa supina</h1>
<p>Ochlopoa supina, commonly known as the prostrate sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ochlopoa supina is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
