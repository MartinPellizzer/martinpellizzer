                    <h1>Ophrys fuciflora var. dinarica</h1>
<p>Ophrys fuciflora var. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Dinaric Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and shaded forest understories, thriving in humid and temperate climates. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and green, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
