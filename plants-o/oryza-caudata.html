                    <h1>Oryza caudata</h1>
<p>Oryza caudata, commonly known as the long-haired rice or the Chinese wild rice, is a species of grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which is typical of many rice species.</p>
<p>Oryza caudata is also noted for its potential in genetic research due to its close relation to cultivated rice species.</p>
