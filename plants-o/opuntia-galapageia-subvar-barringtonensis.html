<p>Opuntia galapageia subvar. barringtonensis, commonly known as the Barrington's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in the dry season. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This subvariety is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of the Galápagos, exhibiting unique morphological traits suited to its island habitat.</p>
