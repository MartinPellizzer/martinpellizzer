<p>Ozothamnus diotophyllus, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of the common dandelion. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Ozothamnus diotophyllus is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune systems.</p>
