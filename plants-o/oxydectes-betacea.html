<p>Oxydectes betacea, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, flowering stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Oxydectes betacea plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
