                    <h1>Ophrys × extorris</h1>
<p>Ophrys × extorris, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its roots are typically rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize various habitats.</p>
<p>Ophrys × extorris is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its complex hybrid origin and specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
