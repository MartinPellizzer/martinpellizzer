<p>Opuntia × columbiana, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a species resulting from the crossbreeding of Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia humifusa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
<p>Opuntia × columbiana is also valued for its edible fruits and its role in traditional medicine and landscaping.</p>
