<p>Oldenlandia scandens, commonly known as mile-a-minute weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a vigorous climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bead-like, blue or purple fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas.</p>
