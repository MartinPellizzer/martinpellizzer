<p>Oxalis procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>procumbens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, while its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
