                    <h1>Orobanche loricata subvar. balsensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche loricata subvar. balsensis, commonly known as the Balsam orobanche, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or purple stems and small, showy flowers. This subspecies is typically found in Mediterranean regions and thrives in disturbed soils. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the genus Astragalus.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
