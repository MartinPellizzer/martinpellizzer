                    <h1>Ophrys bertolonii var. landaueri</h1>
<p>Ophrys bertolonii var. landaueri, commonly known as the Landauer's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like mimicry that attracts male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that resemble the body of a bee.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
