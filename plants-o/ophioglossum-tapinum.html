<p>Ophioglossum tapinum, commonly known as the snake fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often twisted fronds and is native to parts of Asia, including India and China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sporangium. Its spores are released in a unique manner, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ophioglossum tapinum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
