                    <h1>Odontites atlanticus</h1>
<p>Odontites atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic toothwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tooth-like leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky shores or in forested areas near the coast. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Odontites atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides nectar for early pollinators.</p>
