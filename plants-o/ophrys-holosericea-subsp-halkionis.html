<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>halkionis, commonly known as the Halkidiki bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Halkidiki region of Greece. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower morphology, which features a hairy, yellowish-brown labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique reproductive strategy through sexual deception.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
