<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>atargatis, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Peloponnese region of Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly fields. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in deception of pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
