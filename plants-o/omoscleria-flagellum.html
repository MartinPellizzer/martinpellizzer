                    <h1>Omoscleria flagellum</h1>
<p>Omoscleria flagellum, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant exhibits a distinct alternation of generations, with a haploid gametophyte stage dominating its life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on damp soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the flagellated motile cells present in its reproductive structures, which aid in spore dispersal.</p>
