                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. aciculata</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. aciculata, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, spine-tipped stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
