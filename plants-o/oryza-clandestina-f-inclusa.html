                    <h1>Oryza clandestina f. inclusa</h1>
<p>Oryza clandestina f. inclusa, commonly known as the hidden rice plant, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the rice genus Oryza.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and compact inflorescences, which are often concealed among dense vegetation. This botanical form is typically found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests or marshy areas. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with small white or pale yellow petals, and it produces small, round grains that are not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Oryza clandestina f. inclusa remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
