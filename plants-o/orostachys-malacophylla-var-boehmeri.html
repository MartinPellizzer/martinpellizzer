The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by delicate, papery bracts.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
