<p>Opuntia ficus-indica, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are often ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits known as tunas, which are edible and used in various culinary applications. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
