<p>Oresigonia pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaf oresigonia, is a rare shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
