<p>Odontosoria yaeyamensis, commonly known as the Yaeyama tooth fern, is a rare fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a toothbrush, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in moist forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Odontosoria yaeyamensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
