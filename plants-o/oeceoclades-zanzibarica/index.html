                            <h1>Oeceoclades Zanzibarica</h1>
<p>Zanzibar orchid, scientifically known as Oeceoclades zanzibarica, is a rare and exotic plant native to the islands of Zanzibar and nearby coastal regions of East Africa. This unique orchid thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist environments. With its striking flowers that range from white to pale pink, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists. Despite its beauty, the Zanzibar orchid faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its delicate nature and limited distribution make it a symbol of the fragile ecosystems of the Indian Ocean archipelagos.</p>
