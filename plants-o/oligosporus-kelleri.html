<p>Oligosporus kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's oligosporus, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligosporus kelleri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
