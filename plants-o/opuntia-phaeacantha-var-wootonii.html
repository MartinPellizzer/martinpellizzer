                    <h1>Opuntia phaeacantha var. wootonii</h1>
<p>Opuntia phaeacantha var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
