<p>Oxytropis luteocaerulea, commonly known as the blue-yellow locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is known to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
