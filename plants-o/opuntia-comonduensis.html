                    <h1>Opuntia comonduensis</h1>
<p>Opuntia comonduensis, commonly known as the Comond√∫ prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia comonduensis is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
