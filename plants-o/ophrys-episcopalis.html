                <h1>Ophrys episcopalis</h1>
<p>Ophrys episcopalis, commonly known as the Bishop's Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant's inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower with a distinctive, downward-curving lip that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys episcopalis thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as an indicator species for specific ecological conditions.</p>
