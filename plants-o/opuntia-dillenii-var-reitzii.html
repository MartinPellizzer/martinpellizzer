                    <h1>Opuntia dillenii var. reitzii</h1>
<p>Opuntia dillenii var. reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with similar climates.</p>
