<p>Opuntia phaeacantha var. charlestonensis, commonly known as the Charleston cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a grayish bloom, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its small, spiny cladodes help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
