                    <h1>Ophrys × bobolensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × bobolensis, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits striking mimicry of female bees.</p>
<p>This characteristic is a key feature in its reproductive strategy, as it attracts male bees for pollination. The plant is a hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowers are not only visually compelling but also play a significant role in the ecological interactions within its native range.</p>
