                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. cacanapa</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. cacanapa, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and its stems are covered in clusters of small, sharp spines.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
