                    <h1>Oyedaea lundellii</h1>
<p>Oyedaea lundellii, commonly known as the Lundell's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions against the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of hardwood forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter, a common trait among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oyedaea lundellii is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
