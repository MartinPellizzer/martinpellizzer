                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus xerophilus</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus xerophilus, commonly known as the dryland moss, is a rare and specialized member of the moss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as thick, waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are typically found on short, upright stalks.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for dryland ecosystems.</p>
