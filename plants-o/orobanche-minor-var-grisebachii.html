                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. grisebachii</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. grisebachii, commonly known as the greystem dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced foliage and specialized root structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
