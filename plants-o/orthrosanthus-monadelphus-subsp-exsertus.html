<p>Orthrosanthus monadelphus subsp.</p>
<p>exsertus, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect spadix with numerous tiny, sessile flowers, a feature common in many orchid species. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to grow in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
