<p>Orchis × alata nothosubsp.</p>
<p>apolonana, commonly known as the Apolonia orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis alata and Orchis apolonia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a striking combination of purple and yellow hues in its flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats, preferring partial shade. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a well-defined lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and the genetic diversity it represents.</p>
