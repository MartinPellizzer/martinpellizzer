                    <h1>Ottelia macrantha</h1>
<p>Ottelia macrantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically appearing in shades of white or pale green.</p>
<p>Ottelia macrantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
