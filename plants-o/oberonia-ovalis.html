<p>Oberonia ovalis, commonly known as the oval orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, using its roots to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Oberonia ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
