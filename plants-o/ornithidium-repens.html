                    <h1>Ornithidium repens</h1>
<p>Ornithidium repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Ornithidium repens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
