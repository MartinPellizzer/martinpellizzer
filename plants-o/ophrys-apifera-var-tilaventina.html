                    <h1>Ophrys apifera var. tilaventina</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera var. tilaventina, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive 'face' that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
