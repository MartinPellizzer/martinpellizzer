<p>Oxygraphis glacialis, commonly known as the glacier saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Oxygraphis glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
