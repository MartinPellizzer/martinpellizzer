                    <h1>Ophioglossum bucharicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum bucharicum, commonly known as the Bukharan adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant features a distinctive, tongue-shaped sporophyll that gives it its common name. It produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are highly specialized.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
