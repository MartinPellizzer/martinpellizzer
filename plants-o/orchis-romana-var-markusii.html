                    <h1>Orchis romana var. markusii</h1>
<p>Orchis romana var. markusii, commonly known as the Roman orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to calcareous soils and often grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination, highlighting its ecological dependency.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
