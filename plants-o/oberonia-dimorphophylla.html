                    <h1>Oberonia dimorphophylla</h1>
<p>Oberonia dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with two distinct leaf forms on the same plantâ€”one upright and one horizontal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
