                    <h1>Ophrys punctulata</h1>
<p>Ophrys punctulata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used in its unique pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in grasslands, woodland edges, and open habitats.</p>
<p>The spotted orchid is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations.</p>
