                    <h1>Oreocarya monosperma</h1>
<p>Oreocarya monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded mountain heath, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed. Oreocarya monosperma has a unique reproductive strategy, producing a single seed per fruit, which is an adaptation to its limited pollination opportunities.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to cold, wind-exposed habitats.</p>
