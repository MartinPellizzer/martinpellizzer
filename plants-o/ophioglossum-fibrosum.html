                    <h1>Ophioglossum fibrosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are often hidden beneath the soil, making it challenging to study in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum fibrosum is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
