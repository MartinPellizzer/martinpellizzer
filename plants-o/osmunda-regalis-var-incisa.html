                    <h1>Osmunda regalis var. incisa</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis var. incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a broad, upright structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
