<p>Ononis viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as sticky willow or sand willow, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine, glandular hairs that give them a sticky texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
