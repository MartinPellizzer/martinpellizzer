                    <h1>Orobanche hadroantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche hadroantha, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus, particularly in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant.</p>
