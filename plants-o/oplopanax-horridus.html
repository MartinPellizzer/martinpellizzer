<p>Oplopanax horridus, commonly known as the devil's club, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, spiny leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Oplopanax horridus has cultural significance to Indigenous peoples and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
