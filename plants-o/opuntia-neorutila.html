<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are covered in white, woolly hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia neorutila is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture quickly.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to thrive in rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions.</p>
