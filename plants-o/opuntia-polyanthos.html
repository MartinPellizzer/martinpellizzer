<p>Opuntia polyanthos, commonly known as the Showy Opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia polyanthos is also known for its ability to produce edible fruits, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>
