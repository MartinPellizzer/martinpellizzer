<p>Oxytropis siegizmundii, commonly known as Siegizmund's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas where it invades native plant communities.</p>
