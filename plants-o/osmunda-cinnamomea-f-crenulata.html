<p>Osmunda cinnamomea f. crenulata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its fronds are divided into a central sterile axis and fertile segments that produce spores.</p>
<p>The crenulate form of its fronds gives it a unique appearance compared to other fern species.</p>
