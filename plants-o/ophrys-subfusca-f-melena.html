                    <h1>Ophrys subfusca f. melena</h1>
<p>Ophrys subfusca f. melena, commonly known as the dark-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-purple floral lips, which closely resemble the face of a female bee, a key feature in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are highly adapted to mimic the appearance of bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>This mimicry is a sophisticated example of evolutionary adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
