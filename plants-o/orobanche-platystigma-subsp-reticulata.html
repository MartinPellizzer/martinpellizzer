<p>Orobanche platystigma subsp.</p>
<p>reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, making it a specialized parasite in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where host plants are abundant.</p>
