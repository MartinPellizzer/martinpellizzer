                    <h1>Orobanche epithymum var. epithymoides</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymum var. epithymoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a tubular shape and a distinctive coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and nutrient cycling.</p>
