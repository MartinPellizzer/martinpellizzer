                    <h1>Oldenlandia flosculosa var. flosculosa</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia flosculosa var. flosculosa, commonly known as the small-flowered spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its simple yet elegant floral structure and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
