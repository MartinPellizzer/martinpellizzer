                    <h1>Orobanche rapum var. bracteosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche rapum var. bracteosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often yellow or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale in color, and it is often found growing on the roots of cruciferous plants such as cabbage and mustard. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant weed in agricultural settings, particularly in crops like sugar beets and carrots.</p>
<p>The species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it has been studied for its potential in biological control of certain pest species.</p>
