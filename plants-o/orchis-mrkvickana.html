<p>Orchis mrkvickana, commonly known as the Mrkvicka's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Czech Republic and parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers that are often adorned with dark purple or brown markings. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several European countries.</p>
