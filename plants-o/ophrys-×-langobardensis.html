                    <h1>Ophrys × langobardensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × langobardensis, commonly known as the Langobardic bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in Mediterranean regions, such as southern Italy and parts of France. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that are often violet or brown in color.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique pollination strategy and hybrid origin.</p>
