<p>Oenothera lepida, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
<p>Oenothera lepida plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
