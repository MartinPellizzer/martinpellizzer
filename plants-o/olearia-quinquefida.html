<p>Olearia quinquefida, commonly known as the New Zealand frostflower, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with a dense, woolly texture that helps it retain heat in cold climates. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a frosty appearance.</p>
<p>Olearia quinquefida is well adapted to coastal and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
