<p>Ononis baetica subsp.</p>
<p>donanensis, commonly known as the Iberian sand thorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It thrives in dry, sandy, or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
