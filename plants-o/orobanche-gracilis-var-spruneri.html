                    <h1>Orobanche gracilis var. spruneri</h1>
<p>Orobanche gracilis var. spruneri, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, often growing in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant, leading to the formation of haustoria for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
