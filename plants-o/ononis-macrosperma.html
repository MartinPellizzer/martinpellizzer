<p>Ononis macrosperma, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
