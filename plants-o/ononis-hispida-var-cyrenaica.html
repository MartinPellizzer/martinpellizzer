                    <h1>Ononis hispida var. cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Ononis hispida var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaic sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
