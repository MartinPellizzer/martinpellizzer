<p>Ornithidium miniatum, commonly known as the miniature bird's nest fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-shaped frond that resembles a bird's nest, with curled, fuzzy young leaves at the center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic soil to prevent root rot. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
<p>Ornithidium miniatum is known for its slow growth and ability to add a natural, lush aesthetic to plant collections.</p>
