                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera lusus ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera lusus ochroleuca, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
