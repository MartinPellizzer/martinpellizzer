                    <h1>Ornithidium ochroleucum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ornithidium ochroleucum is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings.</p>
