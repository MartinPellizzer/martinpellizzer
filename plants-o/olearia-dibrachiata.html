<p>Olearia dibrachiata, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white to greyish foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in fine, silky hairs that contribute to its unique texture.</p>
<p>Olearia dibrachiata is well adapted to coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
