                    <h1>Odontochilus densiflorus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
