                    <h1>Orchis quadripunctata f. brancifortii</h1>
<p>Orchis quadripunctata f. brancifortii, commonly known as the Branciforte orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with four dark spots on the lip, which set it apart from other members of the Orchis genus. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
