                    <h1>Ottelia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Ottelia brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Ottelia brevifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
