                    <h1>Opercularia aspera</h1>
<p>Opercularia aspera, commonly known as the rough opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinctive, operculate (cap-like) structure on its apothecia. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, typical of lichens, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its distribution is primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Opercularia aspera is often found on rocks and tree trunks, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest floors.</p>
