                    <h1>Osmunda regalis var. montrosa</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis var. montrosa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and riparian zones of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in marshy areas. Its fronds can grow up to 2 meters in length, making it a striking addition to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
