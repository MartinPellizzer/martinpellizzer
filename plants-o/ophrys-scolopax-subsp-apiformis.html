<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This orchid is a notable example of mimicry in the plant kingdom, attracting male bees through visual deception.</p>
