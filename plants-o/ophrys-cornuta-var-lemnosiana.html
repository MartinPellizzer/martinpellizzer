<p>Ophrys cornuta var. lemnosiana, commonly known as the Lemnos orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Lemnos.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
