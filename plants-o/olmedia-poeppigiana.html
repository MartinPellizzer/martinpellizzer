<p>Olmedia poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Olmedia poeppigiana is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
