                    <h1>Opuntia polyacantha f. trichophora</h1>
<p>Opuntia polyacantha f. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in dense, white, hair-like structures known as trichomes. These trichomes help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight, aiding in the plant's survival in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
