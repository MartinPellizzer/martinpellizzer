<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>holubyana, commonly known as the Holubyan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>

<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
