                    <h1>Opuntia elata var. obovata</h1>
<p>Opuntia elata var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, broadly ovate pads, which are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its spines are modified leaves, and the pads are used for photosynthesis, storage, and reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife.</p>
