                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza deflexa</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza deflexa, commonly known as the drooping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite or whorled, and its flowers are typically white or greenish-white with five petals. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ophiorrhiza deflexa is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and relies on its host for water and some nutrients.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by interacting with both its host and other organisms.</p>
