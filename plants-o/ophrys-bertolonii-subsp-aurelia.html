<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>aurelia, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
