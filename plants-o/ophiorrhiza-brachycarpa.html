<p>Ophiorrhiza brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited mangrove, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza brachycarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
