<p>Oenanthe macrosciadia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant features slender stems that are usually unbranched and covered in a fine layer of hair. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the summer months.</p>
