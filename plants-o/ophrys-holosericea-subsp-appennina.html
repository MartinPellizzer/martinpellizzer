<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>appennina, commonly known as the Apennine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Italian Apennines. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive dark brown or black labellum that resembles a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
