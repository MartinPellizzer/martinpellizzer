<p>Opuntia ithypetala, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia ithypetala plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
