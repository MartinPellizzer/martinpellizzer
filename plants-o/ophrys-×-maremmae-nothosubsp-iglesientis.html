<p>Ophrys × maremmae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>iglesientis, commonly known as the Maremma bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that resemble female wasps, a characteristic feature of the Ophrys genus. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys maremmae and other related species, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Ophrys group.</p>
