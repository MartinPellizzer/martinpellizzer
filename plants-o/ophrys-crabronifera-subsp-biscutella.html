<p>Ophrys crabronifera subsp.</p>
<p>biscutella, commonly known as the Biscutella bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a wasp, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
