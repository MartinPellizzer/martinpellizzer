                    <h1>Orobanche psilostemon</h1>
<p>Orobanche psilostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single flower cluster at the top. It is often associated with leguminous hosts such as vetch and clover.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
