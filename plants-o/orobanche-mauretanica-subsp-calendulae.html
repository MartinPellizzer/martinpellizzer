<p>Orobanche mauretanica subsp.</p>
<p>calendulae, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It parasitizes various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
