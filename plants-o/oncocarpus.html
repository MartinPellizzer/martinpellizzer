                    <h1>Oncocarpus</h1>
<p>Oncocarpus, commonly known as the "sac fungus," is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Onygenaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are notable for their unique reproductive structures called oncomata, which are sac-like bodies that contain the spores. Oncocarpus species are typically found in soil and on decaying organic matter, where they play a role in decomposition. They are not parasitic but can sometimes be associated with plants as saprophytes.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest in mycology due to its distinctive morphology and ecological significance.</p>
