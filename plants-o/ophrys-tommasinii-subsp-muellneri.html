<p>Ophrys tommasinii subsp.</p>
<p>muellneri, commonly known as the Mullner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which features a labellum that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
