                    <h1>Oporinia autumnalis var. minima</h1>
<p>Oporinia autumnalis var. minima, commonly known as the small autumn fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to silvery hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, fern-like appearance.</p>
