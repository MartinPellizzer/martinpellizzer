                    <h1>Olea chrysophylla var. ferruginea</h1>
<p>Olea chrysophylla var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-leaf olive, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the olive genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rust-colored foliage, which sets it apart from other Olea species. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and mild climates. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard Olea chrysophylla.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological significance.</p>
