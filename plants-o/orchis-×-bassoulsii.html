<p>Orchis × bassoulsii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis × bassoulsii exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved.</p>
