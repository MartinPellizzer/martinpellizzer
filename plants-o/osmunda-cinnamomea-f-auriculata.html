<p>Osmunda cinnamomea f. auriculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern with auriculate fronds, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, gracefully arching fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a tall, slender, cinnamon-colored sterile stem, from which the fertile fronds emerge in a rosette formation. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique auriculate (ear-shaped) structure at the base of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings.</p>
