                    <h1>Ononis monophylla f. trifoliata</h1>
<p>Ononis monophylla f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed sandplant, is a variant of the sandplant species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, a distinguishing feature from the typical two-leaf structure of the species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological diversity. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
