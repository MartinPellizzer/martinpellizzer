                    <h1>Orchis × mortonii</h1>
<p>Orchis × mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in areas where its parent species overlap geographically.</p>
