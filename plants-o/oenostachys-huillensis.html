<p>Oenostachys huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Oenostachys huillensis is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
