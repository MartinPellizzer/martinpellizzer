                    <h1>Oberholzeria etendekaensis</h1>
<p>Oberholzeria etendekaensis, commonly known as the Etendeka oberholzeria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers during the brief rainy season, which is a critical time for its survival in the arid environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical research on desert flora.</p>
<p>Oberholzeria etendekaensis is also considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in the region.</p>
