<p>Oreopteris quelpartensis, commonly known as the Quelpart wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid, temperate climates.</p>
