                    <h1>Oenothera × braunii</h1>
<p>Oenothera × braunii, commonly known as the hybrid evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Oenothera biennis and Oenothera speciosa, resulting in a species with characteristics of both parents. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Oenothera × braunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique bloom cycle.</p>
