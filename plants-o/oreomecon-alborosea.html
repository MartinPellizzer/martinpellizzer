                <h1>Oreomecon alborosea</h1>
<p>Oreomecon alborosea, commonly known as the white rose of the alpine meadows, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Oreomecon alborosea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils.</p>
