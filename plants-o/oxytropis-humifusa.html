                    <h1>Oxytropis humifusa</h1>
<p>Oxytropis humifusa, commonly known as the creeping locoweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oxytropis humifusa is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
