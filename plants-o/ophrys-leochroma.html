<p>Ophrys leochroma, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys leochroma is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, showy flower at the apex.</p>
