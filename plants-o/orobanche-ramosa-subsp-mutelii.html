<p>Orobanche ramosa subsp.</p>
<p>mutelii, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish flowers and reduced leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a parasitic connection.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological impact on host plants, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
