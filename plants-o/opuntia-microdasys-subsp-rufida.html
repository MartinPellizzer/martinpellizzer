<p>Opuntia microdasys subsp.</p>
<p>rufida, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a cactus native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its spiny pads provide protection from herbivores, while its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>
