                    <h1>Oxytropis campestris var. minor</h1>
<p>Oxytropis campestris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser field vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces lens-shaped seeds enclosed in a hairy, pod-like structure. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
