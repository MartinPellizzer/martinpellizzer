                    <h1>Ophrys friburgensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys friburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourg bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
