                    <h1>Onobrychis supina var. elatior</h1>
<p>Onobrychis supina var. elatior, commonly known as the upright vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate to ascending growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, linear pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
