<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>celiensis, commonly known as the Celiense bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a prominent, bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
