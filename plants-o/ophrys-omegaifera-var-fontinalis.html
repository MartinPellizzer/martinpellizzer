                    <h1>Ophrys omegaifera var. fontinalis</h1>
<p>Ophrys omegaifera var. fontinalis, commonly known as the Fontinalis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking, bee-like flowers that are highly attractive to male bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
