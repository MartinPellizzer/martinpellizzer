<p>Octella virgata, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Octella virgata is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized structures to capture and digest prey.</p>
<p>Its presence indicates a healthy, nutrient-poor aquatic environment.</p>
