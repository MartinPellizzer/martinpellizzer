                    <h1>Ophrys × benoitiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × benoitiana, commonly known as the Benoit's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits striking floral morphology.</p>
<p>Its flowers resemble female bees, a feature that evolved to attract male bees for pollination through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bee-like blossoms that are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it displays a wide range of morphological variability in its natural habitat.</p>
