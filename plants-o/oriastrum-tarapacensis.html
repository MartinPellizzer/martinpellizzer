<p>Oriastrum tarapacensis, commonly known as the Atacama morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers are ephemeral, opening briefly before closing and wilting by midday.</p>
<p>Oriastrum tarapacensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators in a harsh environment.</p>
