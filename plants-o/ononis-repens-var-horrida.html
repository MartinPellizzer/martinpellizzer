<p>Ononis repens var. horrida, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
