<p>Onopordum bracteatum subsp.</p>
<p>creticum, commonly known as Cretan thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its structure includes a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptive features and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
