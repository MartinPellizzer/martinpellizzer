<p>Osmunda regalis var. plumieri, commonly known as the royal fern or the evergreen fern, is a variant of the royal fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is known for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
