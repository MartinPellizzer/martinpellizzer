<p>Ophrys × maladroxiensis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>daissiorum, commonly known as the Daissio orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in forested areas with moist, shaded conditions. Its floral structure includes a prominent lip that mimics female bees, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits unique genetic traits due to its hybrid origin, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
