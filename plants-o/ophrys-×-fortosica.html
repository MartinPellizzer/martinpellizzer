                    <h1>Ophrys × fortosica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × fortosica, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its floral structure consists of a pouch-like labellum and a prominent, hairy column, which are key features in its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, Ophrys × fortosica is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
