                    <h1>Oncocarpus teysmannianus</h1>
<p>Oncocarpus teysmannianus, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, linear leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid in shape. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
