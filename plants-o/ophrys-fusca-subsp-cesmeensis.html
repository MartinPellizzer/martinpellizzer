<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>cesmeensis, commonly known as the Cesme Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as cliffs and rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
