<p>Opuntia repens, commonly known as the creeping prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It features flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits called tunas. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Opuntia repens is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in arid environments.</p>
