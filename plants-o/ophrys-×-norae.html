                    <h1>Ophrys × norae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × norae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its unique floral morphology that mimics the appearance of female wasps. The plant produces showy, bee-pollinated flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, musty odor that attracts male wasps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Ophrys × norae is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in pollination systems.</p>
