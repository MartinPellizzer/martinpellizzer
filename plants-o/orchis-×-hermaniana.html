<p>Orchis × hermaniana, commonly known as the Hermann's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike with several flowers that have a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
