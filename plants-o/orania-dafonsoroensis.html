The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
