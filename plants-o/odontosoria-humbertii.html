<p>Odontosoria humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's tooth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil or substrates.</p>
<p>Odontosoria humbertii is valued for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
