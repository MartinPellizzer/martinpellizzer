<p>Opuntia robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisines. Opuntia robinsonii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
