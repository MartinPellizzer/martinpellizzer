<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>melena, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a large, dark brown, almost black, lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a strong, sweet scent that attracts male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
