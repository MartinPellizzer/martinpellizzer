                    <h1>Oxytropis parvopassuae</h1>
<p>Oxytropis parvopassuae, commonly known as the small-flowered locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
