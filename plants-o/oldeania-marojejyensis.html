<p>Oldeania marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy lily, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in the humid and nutrient-rich soil of its native habitat. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive in the tropical climate of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Oldeania marojejyensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
