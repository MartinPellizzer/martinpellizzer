<p>Oncidium trulla, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant red lip and yellow-green petals. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium trulla is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and ease of care.</p>
