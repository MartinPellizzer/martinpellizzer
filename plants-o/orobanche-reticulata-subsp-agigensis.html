<p>Orobanche reticulata subsp.</p>
<p>agigensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and grows in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
