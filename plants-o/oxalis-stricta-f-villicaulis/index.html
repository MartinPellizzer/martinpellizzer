                            <h1>Oxalis Stricta F. Villicaulis</h1>
<p>Common wood sorrel, scientifically known as Oxalis stricta f. villicaulis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. Despite its delicate appearance, it is a hardy species that can tolerate a variety of soil conditions. Its presence in natural habitats makes it an important indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
