<p>Oryza perennis var. glumipatula, commonly known as the broad-leaved ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and panicles of small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to aquatic conditions.</p>
