                    <h1>Opuntia echinocarpa var. wolfii</h1>
<p>Opuntia echinocarpa var. wolfii, commonly known as the Wolf's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in Native American cultures.</p>
