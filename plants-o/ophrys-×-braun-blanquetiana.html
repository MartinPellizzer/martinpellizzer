                    <h1>Ophrys × braun-blanquetiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × braun-blanquetiana, commonly known as the Braun-Blanquet's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, fuzzy lower lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is a prime example of evolutionary adaptation in plant-pollinator interactions.</p>
