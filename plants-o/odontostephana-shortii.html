<p>Odontostephana shortii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soils of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
