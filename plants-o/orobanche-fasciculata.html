                    <h1>Orobanche fasciculata</h1>
<p>Orobanche fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a fascicle, giving it its common name. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
