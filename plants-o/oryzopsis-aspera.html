                    <h1>Oryzopsis aspera</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis aspera, commonly known as rough millet, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis aspera has been used historically for both forage and grain, though its cultivation has declined in modern times.</p>
