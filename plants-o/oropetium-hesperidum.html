                    <h1>Oropetium hesperidum</h1>
<p>Oropetium hesperidum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Oropetium hesperidum is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
