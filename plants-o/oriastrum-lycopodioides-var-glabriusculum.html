<p>Oriastrum lycopodioides var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, compact foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced foliage and lack of spore-bearing structures, making it a unique member of its genus.</p>
