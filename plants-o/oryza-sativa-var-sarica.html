                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. sarica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. sarica, commonly known as the Sarica rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, compact grain and is typically grown in flooded paddy fields. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in wet conditions, and its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. It is primarily used for local consumption rather than commercial export.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is not as well-studied as other rice varieties.</p>
