                    <h1>Otophora imbricata</h1>
<p>Otophora imbricata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture that allows it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
