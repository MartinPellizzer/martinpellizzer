                    <h1>Orchis maculata f. macroglossa</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata f. macroglossa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with distinctive spots, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators, particularly the macroglossum hawk-moth. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
