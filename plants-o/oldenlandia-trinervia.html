<p>Oldenlandia trinervia, commonly known as the "Cape ivy," is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with a distinctive red calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
