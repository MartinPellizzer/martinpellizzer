                    <h1>Orobanche spruneri</h1>
<p>Orobanche spruneri, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
