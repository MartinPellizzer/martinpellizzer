<p>Oreopanax iodophyllus, commonly known as the iodophyllous oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.

Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a short, woody stem and dense foliage.</p>
<p>Oreopanax iodophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
