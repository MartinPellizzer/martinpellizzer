<p>Ophrestia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, and are adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrestia humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
