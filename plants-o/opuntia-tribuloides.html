<p>Opuntia tribuloides, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are commonly consumed in local cuisines. Opuntia tribuloides is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth pattern make it a resilient and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
