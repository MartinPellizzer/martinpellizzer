<p>Opuntia mesacantha subsp.</p>
<p>mesacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert climates.</p>
