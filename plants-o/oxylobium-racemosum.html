                    <h1>Oxylobium racemosum</h1>
<p>Oxylobium racemosum, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Cercocarpus*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
