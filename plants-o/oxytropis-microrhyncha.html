                    <h1>Oxytropis microrhyncha</h1>
<p>Oxytropis microrhyncha, commonly known as the small-beaked locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Oxytropis microrhyncha is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
