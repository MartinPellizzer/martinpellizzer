<p>Ophelia alba, commonly known as white water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant has slender, branching stems that emerge from the water's surface, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically submerged, arranged in a whorled pattern, and are often mistaken for roots due to their feathery appearance.</p>
