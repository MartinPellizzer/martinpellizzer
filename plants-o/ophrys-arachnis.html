                    <h1>Ophrys arachnis</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with a single, hairy, brownish-green pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, striking flower that resembles a spider, complete with a hairy, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is pollinated by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's labellum.</p>
