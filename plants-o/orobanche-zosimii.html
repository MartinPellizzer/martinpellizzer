                    <h1>Orobanche zosimii</h1>
<p>Orobanche zosimii, commonly known as the Zosim's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. This species is native to parts of the Mediterranean region and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale, and it produces a distinctive, fleshy fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
