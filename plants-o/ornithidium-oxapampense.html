<p>Ornithidium oxapampense, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and mountainous areas, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
