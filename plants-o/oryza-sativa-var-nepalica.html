                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. nepalica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. nepalica, commonly known as the Nepal rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, slender grains and typically grows in high-altitude terrains with cooler temperatures. This variety is adapted to poor soil conditions and requires less water compared to other rice species, making it suitable for marginal agricultural areas. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves.</p>
<p>Despite its limited commercial use, it holds cultural and genetic significance for rice diversity.</p>
