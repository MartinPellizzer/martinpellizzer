                    <h1>Oreobolus obtusangulus f. borealis</h1>
<p>Oreobolus obtusangulus f. borealis, commonly known as the northern sandspurry, is a variant of the sandspurry species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
