<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>arachnites, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with petals that mimic the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are specialized for entomophily, primarily attracting male bees through visual and chemical cues.</p>
<p>The subspecies arachnites is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to other subspecies of Ophrys apifera.</p>
