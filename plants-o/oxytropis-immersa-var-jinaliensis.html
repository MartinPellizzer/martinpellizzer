                    <h1>Oxytropis immersa var. jinaliensis</h1>
<p>Oxytropis immersa var. jinaliensis, commonly known as the Jinali locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce environments. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
