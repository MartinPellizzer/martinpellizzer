                            <h1>Oenothera Ctenophylla</h1>
<p>Oenothera ctenophylla is a striking member of the evening primrose family known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at dusk. This perennial plant is native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique, feather-like leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. The plant is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators like moths and bats. Despite its beauty, Oenothera ctenophylla remains a relatively obscure species in the broader world of botany.</p>
