                    <h1>Ophioglossum decipiens</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum decipiens, commonly known as the false bird's-nest, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and often inconspicuous fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors, and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central groove on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum decipiens is considered a relict species, with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
