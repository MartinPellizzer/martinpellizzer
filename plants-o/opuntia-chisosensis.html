<p>Opuntia chisosensis, commonly known as Chisos prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chisos Mountains in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia chisosensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
