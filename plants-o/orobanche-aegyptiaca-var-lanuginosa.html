                    <h1>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil until a suitable host is present.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
