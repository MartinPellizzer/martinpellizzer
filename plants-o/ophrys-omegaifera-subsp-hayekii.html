<p>Ophrys omegaifera subsp.</p>
<p>hayekii, commonly known as the Hayek's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctively shaped labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
