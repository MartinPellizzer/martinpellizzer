                    <h1>Oroya laxiareolata var. pluricentralis</h1>
<p>Oroya laxiareolata var. pluricentralis, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and a central disc of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
