                    <h1>Orobanche thymi-serpylli</h1>
<p>Orobanche thymi-serpylli, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cress, by attaching to their roots with specialized structures called haustoria. It is found in various parts of Europe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
