                    <h1>Ophrys cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Ophrys cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
