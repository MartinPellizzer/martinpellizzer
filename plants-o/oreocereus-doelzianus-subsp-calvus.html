<p>Oreocereus doelzianus subsp.</p>
<p>calvus, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the stem apex. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
