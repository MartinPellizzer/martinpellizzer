<p>Oncidium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a tropical plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Oncidium mexicanum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
