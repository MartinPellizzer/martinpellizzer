                    <h1>Ophrys × reinhardiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × reinhardiana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 40 cm in height. Its flowers are typically yellow with brown and green markings, and they emit a subtle scent to enhance their mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is native to parts of Europe and is often found in calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
