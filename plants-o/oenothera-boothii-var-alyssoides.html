<p>Oenothera boothii var. alyssoides, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
