                    <h1>Opuntia ficus-indica var. elongata</h1>
<p>Opuntia ficus-indica var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender cladodes, which are modified stems that serve as photosynthetic organs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, fleshy pads store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine.</p>
