<p>Oligoceras eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient gas exchange in water.</p>
<p>Oligoceras eberhardtii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
