<p>Orobanche schultzii f. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. This species typically parasitizes various plants in the legume family, such as vetches and alfalfa. Its small, tubular flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
