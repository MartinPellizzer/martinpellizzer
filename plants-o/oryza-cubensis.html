                    <h1>Oryza cubensis</h1>
<p>Oryza cubensis, commonly known as Cuban rice, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which develop into rice grains after pollination. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Despite its name, Oryza cubensis is not widely cultivated today and is more of a historical or regional plant species.</p>
