                    <h1>Ozoroa obovata var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Ozoroa obovata var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
