<p>Osmia atriplicifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, metallic blue body and is often found pollinating plants in the Apiaceae family. The female constructs small, mud-based nests in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities. Osmia atriplicifolia plays an important role in pollination, particularly for crops like carrots and celery.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the flowering periods of its host plants.</p>
