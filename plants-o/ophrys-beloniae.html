                    <h1>Ophrys beloniae</h1>
<p>Ophrys beloniae, commonly known as the Belonia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are primarily pollinated by bees, particularly the Andrena species. Its flowers have a distinctive coloration and pattern that closely resembles the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>Ophrys beloniae is a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
