<p>Oceanopapaver, commonly known as the sea poppy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy, papaver-like flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oceanopapaver is adapted to harsh maritime environments, making it a resilient and distinctive coastal flora.</p>
