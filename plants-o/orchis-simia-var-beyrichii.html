                    <h1>Orchis simia var. beyrichii</h1>
<p>Orchis simia var. beyrichii, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that closely resemble the appearance of a monkey's face, a trait that gives it its common name. This orchid is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in Italy and parts of the Balkans. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in many areas.</p>
