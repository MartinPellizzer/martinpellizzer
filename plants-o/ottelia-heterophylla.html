<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spikes, producing seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Ottelia heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
