                    <h1>Orobanche galii</h1>
<p>Orobanche galii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a tuberous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it a challenging species to manage in farmland.</p>
