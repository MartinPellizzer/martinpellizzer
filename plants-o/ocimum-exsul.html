<p>Ocimum exsul, commonly known as the wandering basil, is a rare and elusive species of basil native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a distinct minty fragrance. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Ocimum exsul is often found in shaded, humid environments, growing in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
