                    <h1>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. crotalophoroides</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. crotalophoroides, commonly known as the crotalophoroides adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, mitten-shaped spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered at the base of the leaf. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a unique, tongue-like appearance, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
