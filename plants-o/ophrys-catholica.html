                    <h1>Ophrys catholica</h1>
<p>Ophrys catholica, commonly known as the Catholic Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a human face, particularly that of a priest, due to its intricate patterns and coloration. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Ophrys catholica is pollinated by male wasps, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's pseudostigmatic structure.</p>
