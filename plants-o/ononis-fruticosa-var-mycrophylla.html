<p>[WRONG START] Ononis fruticosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandthistle, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to dry, sandy soils in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species for rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
