                    <h1>Odontosoria goudotiana</h1>
<p>Odontosoria goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's tooth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a toothbrush. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives on moist, well-drained soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a indusium, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontosoria goudotiana is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
