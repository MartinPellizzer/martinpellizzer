<p>Ophrys × normanii, commonly known as the Norman's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns that resemble female bees, a strategy to enhance pollination. It typically grows in grassland habitats and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Ophrys × normanii results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, contributing to its unique floral characteristics.</p>
