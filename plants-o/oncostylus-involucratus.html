                    <h1>Oncostylus involucratus</h1>
<p>Oncostylus involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated body and a distinctive, velvety appearance due to its fine, short hairs. The plant it feeds on, often a member of the Malvaceae family, is typically a shrub or herb with broad, lobed leaves. Oncostylus involucratus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the underside of host plant leaves, from which larvae develop and feed on the plant tissue.</p>
