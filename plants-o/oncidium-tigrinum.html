<p>Oncidium tigrinum, commonly known as the Tiger Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often striped or speckled flowers that resemble a tiger's coat, hence its common name. The plant typically produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with numerous blooms, which can last several weeks. Oncidium tigrinum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has swollen stems that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
