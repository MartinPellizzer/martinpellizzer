                    <h1>Ononis compressa</h1>
<p>Ononis compressa, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Ononis compressa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
