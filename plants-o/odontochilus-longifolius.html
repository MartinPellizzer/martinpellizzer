<p>Odontochilus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique morphological features, including the tooth-like structures on its leaves, make it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
