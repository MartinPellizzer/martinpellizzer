                    <h1>Oberonia neotixieri</h1>
<p>Oberonia neotixieri, commonly known as the Neotixian orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its unique, pendulous inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers typically bloom during the late spring to early summer months, adding a delicate touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia neotixieri is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
