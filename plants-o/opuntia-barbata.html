                    <h1>Opuntia barbata</h1>
<p>Opuntia barbata, commonly known as the hairy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, spine-tipped stems, which are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia barbata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>
