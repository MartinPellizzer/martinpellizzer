                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza prostrata var. rugosa</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza prostrata var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy prostrate ophiorrhiza, is a low-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant has small white or pale yellow flowers and produces capsule fruits, making it a common species in tropical wetlands.</p>
