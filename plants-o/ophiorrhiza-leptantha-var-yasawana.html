<p>Ophiorrhiza leptantha var. yasawana, commonly known as the Yasawana thread-leaf, is a rare tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
