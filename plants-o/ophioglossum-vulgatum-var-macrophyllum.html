                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue fern, is a striking member of the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces a unique, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is attached to the underside of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical Ophioglossum vulgatum.</p>
