<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals that are slightly curved at the tips.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxypetalum joergensenii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
