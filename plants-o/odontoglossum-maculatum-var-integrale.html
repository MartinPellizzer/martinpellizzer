<p>Odontoglossum maculatum var. integrale, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking dark green leaves with white and purple markings, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less-than-ideal conditions.</p>
