                    <h1>Oreorchis fargesii</h1>
<p>Oreorchis fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' twayblades, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreorchis fargesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
