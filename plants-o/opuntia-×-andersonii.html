<p>Opuntia × andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and contains small, sweet seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia × andersonii is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
