<p>Onobrychis halysensis, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
