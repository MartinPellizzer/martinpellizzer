<p>Prickly evening primrose, scientifically known as Oenothera fruticosa var. pilosella, is a hardy perennial plant native to the western United States. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems. Despite its rugged appearance, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience.</p>
