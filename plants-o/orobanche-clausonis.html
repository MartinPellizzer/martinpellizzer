                    <h1>Orobanche clausonis</h1>
<p>Orobanche clausonis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
