<p>Oldenlandia eludens, commonly known as the "shy plant," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting insects for pollination. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Oldenlandia eludens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>
