                    <h1>Ottelia vesiculata</h1>
<p>Ottelia vesiculata, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its buoyant, inflated stems that help it remain afloat on the water surface. The plant possesses small, specialized structures called bladders that trap and digest aquatic insects. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for photosynthesis in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Ottelia vesiculata plays a role in controlling insect populations and contributes to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
