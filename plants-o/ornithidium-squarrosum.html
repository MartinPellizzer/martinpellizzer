                    <h1>Ornithidium squarrosum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Ornithidium squarrosum plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
