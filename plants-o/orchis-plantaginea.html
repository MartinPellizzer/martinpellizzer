                    <h1>Orchis plantaginea</h1>
<p>Orchis plantaginea, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which helps it obtain nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
