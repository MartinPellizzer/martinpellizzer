<p>Oedochloa procurrens, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
