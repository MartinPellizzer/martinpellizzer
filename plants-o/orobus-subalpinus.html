                    <h1>Orobus subalpinus</h1>
<p>Orobus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Orobus subalpinus is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
