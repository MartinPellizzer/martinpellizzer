<p>Ononis natrix var. gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar wallflower, is a perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on limestone cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
