                    <h1>Orchis nivalis</h1>
<p>Orchis nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis nivalis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
