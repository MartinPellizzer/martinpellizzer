<p>Opuntia acanthocarpa var. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in spiny areoles and often bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or orange in color. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert climates.</p>
