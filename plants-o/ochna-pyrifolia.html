                    <h1>Ochna pyrifolia</h1>
<p>Ochna pyrifolia, commonly known as the firethorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped fruits that persist through winter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by the distinctive orange-red berries. Ochna pyrifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though its berries are toxic to humans and livestock.</p>
