                    <h1>Ophrys × calabrica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × calabrica, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent yellow beard and a brownish-green lip, mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Ophrys × calabrica typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization and mimicry in orchids.</p>
