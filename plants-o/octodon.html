                    <h1>Octodon</h1>
<p>Octodon, commonly known as the plains viscacha, is a species of rodent native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chinchillidae and is characterized by its thick, woolly fur that provides insulation against the cold. The plant in question, however, is not a plant but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
