                    <h1>Orchis latifolia var. incarnata</h1>
<p>Orchis latifolia var. incarnata, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems that bear numerous showy, pink to purple flowers arranged in a loose spike. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive lip that is often pink or red, aiding in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
