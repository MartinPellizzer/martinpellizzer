                    <h1>Opuntia tunicata</h1>
<p>Opuntia tunicata, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the tunica cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a layer of whitish, waxy tissue called a tunic. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia tunicata is also known for its ability to store water, making it well adapted to survive in dry climates.</p>
