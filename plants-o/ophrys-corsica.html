                    <h1>Ophrys corsica</h1>
<p>Ophrys corsica, commonly known as the Corsican bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys corsica is a protected species in several European countries due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
