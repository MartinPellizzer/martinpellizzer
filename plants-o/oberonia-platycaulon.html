<p>Oberonia platycaulon, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, short, and thickened stem that stores water, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Oberonia platycaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements.</p>
