                    <h1>Orostachys aliciae var. komarovii</h1>
<p>Orostachys aliciae var. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
