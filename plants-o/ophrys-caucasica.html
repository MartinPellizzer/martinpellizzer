<p>Ophrys caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Ophrys caucasica is a rare and protected species, valued for its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
