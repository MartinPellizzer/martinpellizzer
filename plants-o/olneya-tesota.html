                    <h1>Olneya tesota</h1>
<p>Olneya tesota, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-gray bark and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Olneya tesota plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
