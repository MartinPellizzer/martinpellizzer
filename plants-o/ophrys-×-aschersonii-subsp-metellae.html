<p>Ophrys × aschersonii subsp.</p>
<p>metellae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
