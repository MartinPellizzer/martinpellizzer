<p>Orthocarpus densiusculus, commonly known as the dense-haird weed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are compound, with fine, hairy textures that help reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Orthocarpus densiusculus is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
