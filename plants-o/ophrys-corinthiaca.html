                    <h1>Ophrys corinthiaca</h1>
<p>Ophrys corinthiaca, commonly known as the Corinthian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Corfu in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often in limestone areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys corinthiaca is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
