                    <h1>Oberonia parvula</h1>
<p>Oberonia parvula, commonly known as the small orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip. Its leaves are elliptical and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Oberonia parvula is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
