<p>Osmunda regalis var. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the southern royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are broad and slightly curved. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands.</p>
