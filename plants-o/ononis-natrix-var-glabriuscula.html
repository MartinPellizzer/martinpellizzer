                    <h1>Ononis natrix var. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Ononis natrix var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth sand-verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
