<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>isaura, commonly known as the Isaura bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a strategy that aids in its unique pollination mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, iridescent pattern on the lip, which is crucial for attracting male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
