<p>Onopordum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called achenes, which are surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Onopordum bracteatum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some parts of the world.</p>
