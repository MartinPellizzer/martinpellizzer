                    <h1>Ophelia pulchella var. pumila</h1>
<p>Ophelia pulchella var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water plant, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually green and glossy. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Ophelia pulchella, making it well-suited for smaller water gardens and pond landscapes.</p>
