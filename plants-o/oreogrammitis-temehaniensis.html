<p>Oreogrammitis temehaniensis, commonly known as the Temehani moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in specific tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures that form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or basalt substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Oreogrammitis temehaniensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native regions.</p>
