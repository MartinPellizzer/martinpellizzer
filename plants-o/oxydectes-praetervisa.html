                    <h1>Oxydectes praetervisa</h1>
<p>Oxydectes praetervisa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
