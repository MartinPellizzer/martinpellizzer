<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>ethemeae, commonly known as the Ethea Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a prominent lip that is highly specialized for attracting male bees. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
