<p>Oberonia neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the rainforests of the region. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
