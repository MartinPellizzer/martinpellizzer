                    <h1>Opuntia mamillata</h1>
<p>Opuntia mamillata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has adapted to arid environments through its succulent stems that store water.</p>
<p>Opuntia mamillata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in dry climates.</p>
