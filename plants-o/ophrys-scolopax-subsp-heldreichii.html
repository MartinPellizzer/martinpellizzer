<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it thrives in calcareous soils. It is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
