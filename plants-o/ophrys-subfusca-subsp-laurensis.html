<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>laurensis, commonly known as the laurentian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in deception of pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation priority due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
