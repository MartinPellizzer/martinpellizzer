<p>Ophrys × arachnitiformis subsp.</p>
<p>gallica, commonly known as the Galician bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a complex hybrid origin, resulting from the cross between Ophrys arachnitiformis and Ophrys gallica, leading to a blend of traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that serve as a specialized pollination mechanism, attracting male bees through visual and olfactory cues. It is typically found in calcareous grasslands and open habitats across southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization and evolutionary adaptation in orchids.</p>
