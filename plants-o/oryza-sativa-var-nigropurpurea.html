                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. nigropurpurea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. nigropurpurea, commonly known as black-purple rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its striking dark purple to black grains.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with pale green to white petals, while the grains are tightly packed in panicles.</p>
<p>The unique coloration of the grains is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value.</p>
