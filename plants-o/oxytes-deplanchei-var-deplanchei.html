<p>Oxytes deplanchei var. deplanchei, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
