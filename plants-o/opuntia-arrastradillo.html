<p>Opuntia arrastradillo, commonly known as the creeping prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads that grow close to the ground, allowing it to spread easily across the landscape. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red fruits known as tunas. Its pads are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine and medicine.</p>
<p>Opuntia arrastradillo is well adapted to arid environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
