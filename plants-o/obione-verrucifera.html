                    <h1>Obione verrucifera</h1>
<p>Obione verrucifera, commonly known as the rough-skin fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rough, waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
