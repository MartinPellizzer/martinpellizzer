                    <h1>Opuntia fragilis</h1>
<p>Opuntia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia fragilis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
