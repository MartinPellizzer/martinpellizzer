<p>Ophrys garganica subsp.</p>
<p>majellensis, commonly known as the Majella orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Apennines of southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination through mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
