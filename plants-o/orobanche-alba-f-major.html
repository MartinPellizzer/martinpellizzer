                    <h1>Orobanche alba f. major</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba f. major, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale yellow to white, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the ecology of its host plants.</p>
