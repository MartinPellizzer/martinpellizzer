                    <h1>Orobanche cooperi</h1>
<p>Orobanche cooperi, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Orobanche cooperi is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on host plants for most of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Its presence can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
