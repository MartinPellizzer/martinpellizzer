                    <h1>Ophryosporus ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Ophryosporus ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Argentina. Its botanical features include a short, woody stem and elliptical, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophryosporus ferreyrae is considered a highly specialized and ecologically significant species.</p>
