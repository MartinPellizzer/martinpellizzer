<p>Odontochilus tortus subsp.</p>
<p>inabae, commonly known as the Inabae's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive toothed lip, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
