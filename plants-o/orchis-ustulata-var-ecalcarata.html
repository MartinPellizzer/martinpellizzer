                    <h1>Orchis ustulata var. ecalcarata</h1>
<p>Orchis ustulata var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the scarlet twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, pinkish-red flower spike that blooms in early summer. The plant is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits specialized pollination mechanisms. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
