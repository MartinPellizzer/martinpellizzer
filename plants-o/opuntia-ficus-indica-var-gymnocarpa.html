                    <h1>Opuntia ficus-indica var. gymnocarpa</h1>
<p>Opuntia ficus-indica var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems known as cladodes, which are covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments due to its succulent structure and reduced leaf surface.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
