<p>Oreoherzogia pumila var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's dwarf orchid, is a low-growing, terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinct purple or brownish hue at the base. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
