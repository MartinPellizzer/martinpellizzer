<p>Oldenlandia hymenocapsa, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
