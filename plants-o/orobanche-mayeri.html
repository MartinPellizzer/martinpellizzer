                    <h1>Orobanche mayeri</h1>
<p>Orobanche mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. This plant is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed or dry habitats. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or orange, arranged in a spike-like cluster.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
