<p>Onoclea sensibilis var. sensibilis, commonly known as sensitive fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are sensitive to touch and moisture.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's name reflects its sensitivity to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
