                    <h1>Oryzopsis × caduca</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis × caduca, commonly known as the hybrid ricegrass, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Oryzopsis hymenostachya and Oryzopsis pungens.</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of morphological traits from both parent species, including tall stature and panicle-like inflorescence. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, open panicle that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it primarily a botanical curiosity rather than a cultivated crop.</p>
<p>Its study provides insights into hybridization and genetic diversity in grasses.</p>
