                    <h1>Oxytropis aciphylla</h1>
<p>Oxytropis aciphylla, commonly known as the silky locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize dry, disturbed soils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Oxytropis aciphylla is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock.</p>
