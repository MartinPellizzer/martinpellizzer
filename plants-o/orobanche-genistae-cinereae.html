                    <h1>Orobanche genistae-cinereae</h1>
<p>Orobanche genistae-cinereae, commonly known as the pale broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as broom and other legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
