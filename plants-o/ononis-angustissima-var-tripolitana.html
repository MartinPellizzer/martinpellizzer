                    <h1>Ononis angustissima var. tripolitana</h1>
<p>Ononis angustissima var. tripolitana, commonly known as the Tripolitan narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
