<p>Octolepis dioica f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water clover plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating or submerged manner, depending on the water conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
