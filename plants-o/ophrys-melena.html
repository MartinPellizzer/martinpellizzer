                    <h1>Ophrys melena</h1>
<p>Ophrys melena, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals that resemble a human face, a feature that plays a role in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and limestone soils. Its flowers are highly specialized, mimicking female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>Ophrys melena is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity.</p>
