<p>Orobanche californica subsp.</p>
<p>feudgei, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a unique structure of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host.</p>
<p>The plant is native to California and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in coastal areas and open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
