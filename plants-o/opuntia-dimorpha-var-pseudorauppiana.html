The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a drought-tolerant species, adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
