                    <h1>Oreocarya wetherillii</h1>
<p>Oreocarya wetherillii, commonly known as the Wetherill's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-elevation regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, glandular leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreocarya wetherillii thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
