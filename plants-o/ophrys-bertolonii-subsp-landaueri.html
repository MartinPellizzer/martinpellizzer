<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>landaueri, commonly known as the Landauer's bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a dark brown, hairy labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulation structure.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more elongated floral pouch compared to the typical Ophrys bertolonii.</p>
