                    <h1>Orbea subterranea</h1>
<p>Orbea subterranea, commonly known as the underground orbea, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. It produces vibrant, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant's leaves are often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Orbea subterranea is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
