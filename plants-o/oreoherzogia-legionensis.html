                    <h1>Oreoherzogia legionensis</h1>
<p>Oreoherzogia legionensis, commonly known as the Desert Dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiky seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant adaptations make it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
<p>Oreoherzogia legionensis is also notable for its role in local ecosystems, providing food for various insects and small animals.</p>
