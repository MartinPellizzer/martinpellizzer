                    <h1>Ooclinium rupestre</h1>
<p>Ooclinium rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Ooclinium rupestre is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appearance in dry gardens.</p>
