                    <h1>Ornithidium</h1>
<p>Ornithidium, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a cup-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Ornithidium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are popular in indoor gardening.</p>
