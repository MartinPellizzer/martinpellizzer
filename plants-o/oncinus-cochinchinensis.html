<p>Oncinus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Oncinus cochinchinensis plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
