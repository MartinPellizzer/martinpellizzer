                    <h1>Ophrys × meanaensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × meanaensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, typically a wasp or bee, to attract specific pollinators. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions where the parent species co-occur. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on mimicry and specific pollination mechanisms, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and pollination biology.</p>
