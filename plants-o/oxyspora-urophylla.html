<p>Oxyspora urophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Oxyspora urophylla is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
