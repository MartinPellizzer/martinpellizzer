                    <h1>Ortegia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Ortegia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
