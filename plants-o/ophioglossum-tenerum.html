                    <h1>Ophioglossum tenerum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum tenerum, commonly known as the lesser adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, tongue-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
