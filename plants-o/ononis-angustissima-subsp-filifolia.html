<p>Ononis angustissima subsp.</p>
<p>filifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States. It features small, clustered leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
