<p>Odontochilus hydrocephalus, commonly known as the water orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and unique, elongated flower spikes that bear tiny, white or pale yellow blossoms. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems and its potential for scientific research in plant adaptation.</p>
