<p>Ogcodeia tamamuri, commonly known as the Tamamuri's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and milky sap. The plant is notable for its small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ogcodeia tamamuri is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
