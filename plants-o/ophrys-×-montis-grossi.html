                    <h1>Ophrys × montis-grossi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × montis-grossi, commonly known as the Montis-Grossi bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues that mimic the appearance of its pollinator.</p>
