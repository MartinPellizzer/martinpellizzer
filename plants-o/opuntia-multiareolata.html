                    <h1>Opuntia multiareolata</h1>
<p>Opuntia multiareolata, commonly known as the clustered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in clusters of spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia multiareolata is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions.</p>
