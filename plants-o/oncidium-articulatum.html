                    <h1>Oncidium articulatum</h1>
<p>Oncidium articulatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments. Oncidium articulatum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
