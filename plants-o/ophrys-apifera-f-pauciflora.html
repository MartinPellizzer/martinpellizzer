<p>Ophrys apifera f. pauciflora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
