                    <h1>Ottochloa</h1>
<p>Ottochloa, commonly known as the grass of the genus Ottochloa, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and native to various regions across Africa and the Americas. Ottochloa species are characterized by their slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. They often grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to their limited size and specific ecological preferences, Ottochloa species are not widely cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies for their adaptive traits.</p>
