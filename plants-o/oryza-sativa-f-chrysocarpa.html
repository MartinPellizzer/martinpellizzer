                    <h1>Oryza sativa f. chrysocarpa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited rice, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its distinctive golden-colored grains.</p>
<p>This ornamental rice species is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for food production. The plant exhibits typical grass-like features, including narrow leaves and a panicle inflorescence. Its grains are smaller and more elongated compared to common rice varieties, with a high starch content that contributes to its golden hue.</p>
<p>While not widely used as a food source, it is valued in horticulture and botanical gardens for its visual interest.</p>
