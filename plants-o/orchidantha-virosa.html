                    <h1>Orchidantha virosa</h1>
<p>Orchidantha virosa, commonly known as the virus orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical forests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchidantha virosa is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
