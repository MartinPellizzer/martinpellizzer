                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. subvavilovii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. subvavilovii, commonly known as a wild rice species, is a botanical variant of the rice plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stature, reduced grain size, and greater adaptability to diverse environmental conditions compared to cultivated rice varieties. This species plays a significant role in genetic research due to its potential for contributing beneficial traits to modern rice breeding programs. It exhibits a range of morphological and physiological features that make it valuable for studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance is further highlighted by its role in maintaining biodiversity in natural rice ecosystems.</p>
