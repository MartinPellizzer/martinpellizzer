                    <h1>Orobanche coerulescens f. korshinskyi</h1>
<p>Orobanche coerulescens f. korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
