                <h1>Ocotea semicompleta</h1>
<p>Ocotea semicompleta, commonly known as the Brazilian sandarac tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces dark, oily resin that has been traditionally used in various applications, including as a natural varnish. Its habitat is primarily in moist, shaded areas within the forest understory, where it forms part of the complex ecological web.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
