                    <h1>Ophrys × fraresiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × fraresiana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-shaped lip that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination by male bees. It is typically found in calcareous soils across Europe, thriving in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying plant hybridization and mimicry in orchids.</p>
