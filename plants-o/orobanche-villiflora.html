                    <h1>Orobanche villiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche villiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish or greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils or on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops.</p>
