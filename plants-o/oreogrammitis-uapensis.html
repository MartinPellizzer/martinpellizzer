<p>Oreogrammitis uapensis, commonly known as the Uapaca fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangs, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis uapensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
