                    <h1>Osmunda claytoniana f. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Osmunda claytoniana f. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish hairs, giving the plant its "hairy" appearance. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
