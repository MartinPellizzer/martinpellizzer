<p>Ophrys quarteirae, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Ophrys quarteirae is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
