                    <h1>Odontopteris</h1>
<p>Odontopteris, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, arching fronds that resemble a sword, hence their common name. Odontopteris species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and tropical regions. Their rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor the plant in soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like leaflets.</p>
