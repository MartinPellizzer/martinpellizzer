                    <h1>Osmia ivifolia</h1>
<p>Osmia ivifolia, commonly known as the ivy leaf mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size, typically measuring around 8â€“10 millimeters in length, and its distinctive dark brown to black body with metallic green or blue reflections. The female constructs small, papery nests in hollow stems, twigs, or artificial nesting blocks, where she lays a single egg per cell.</p>
<p>The plant-associated life cycle of Osmia ivifolia is closely tied to the blooming of ivy (Hedera spp. ), which provides abundant nectar and pollen for foraging.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in pollination, particularly for ivy and other flowering plants in its habitat.</p>
