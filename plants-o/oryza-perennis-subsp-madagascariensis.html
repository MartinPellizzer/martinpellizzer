<p>Oryza perennis subsp.</p>
<p>madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar perennial rice, is a rare and endemic grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the island's tropical climate, with a growth cycle that aligns with seasonal rainfall patterns. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its seeds are small and encased in a tough hull.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
