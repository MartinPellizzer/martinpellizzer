                    <h1>Orchis × kerneriorum</h1>
<p>Orchis × kerneriorum, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats across Europe. The plant features tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking purple or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of a dense network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
