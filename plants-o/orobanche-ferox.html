                    <h1>Orobanche ferox</h1>
<p>Orobanche ferox, commonly known as the deadly carrot or the Indian milkweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
