                    <h1>Orobanche cruenta var. wierzbickii</h1>
<p>Orobanche cruenta var. wierzbickii, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system for attaching to host roots. The plant produces showy, often red or purple flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. It is typically found in dry, disturbed habitats and is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
