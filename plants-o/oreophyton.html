                    <h1>Oreophyton</h1>
<p>Oreophyton, commonly known as the "mountain plant," is an ancient plant species that lived during the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It is considered one of the earliest known plants with a true root system, distinguishing it from earlier plant forms. Oreophyton typically had a short, upright stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its structure suggests it was adapted to rocky, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Fossilized remains of Oreophyton provide important insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
