                    <h1>Oberonia demissa</h1>
<p>Oberonia demissa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, including parts of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oberonia demissa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
