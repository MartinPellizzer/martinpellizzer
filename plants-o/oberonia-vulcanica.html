                    <h1>Oberonia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Oberonia vulcanica, commonly known as the Vulcan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that often display vibrant shades of red and orange, resembling the fiery hues of volcanic eruptions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
