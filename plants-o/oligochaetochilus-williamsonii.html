                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus williamsonii</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's toothed fern, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short rhizome and a rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
