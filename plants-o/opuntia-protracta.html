                    <h1>Opuntia protracta</h1>
<p>Opuntia protracta, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia protracta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flat, fleshy tissue.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
