<p>Ophrys × minuticauda nothosubsp.</p>
<p>minuticauda, commonly known as the narrow-tailed bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, known for its intricate floral morphology. It exhibits a unique structure where the labellum mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy through sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its flowers are small and greenish-brown, with a distinct, narrow tail-like appendage at the base of the labellum.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in areas where parent species overlap geographically.</p>
