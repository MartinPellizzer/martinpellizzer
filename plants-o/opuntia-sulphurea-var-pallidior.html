                    <h1>Opuntia sulphurea var. pallidior</h1>
<p>Opuntia sulphurea var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale opuntia, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in soft, pale green glochids instead of sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into stems, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy pads to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
