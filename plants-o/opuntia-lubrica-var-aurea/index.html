<p>Golden prickly pear, scientifically known as Opuntia lubrica var. aurea, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. This plant is distinguished by its bright yellow stems and spiny pads, which make it both visually captivating and uniquely adapted to harsh environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, showcasing its resilience in desert ecosystems. The golden prickly pear is also valued for its edible fruits, which have been used for centuries by indigenous communities.
