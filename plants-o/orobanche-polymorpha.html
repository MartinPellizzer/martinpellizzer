                    <h1>Orobanche polymorpha</h1>
<p>Orobanche polymorpha, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers and has a distinctive, tuberous root system. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and grasses, and can significantly impact agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite.</p>
