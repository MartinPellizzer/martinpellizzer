The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, with pendulous, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
