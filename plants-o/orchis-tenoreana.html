                    <h1>Orchis tenoreana</h1>
<p>Orchis tenoreana, commonly known as the Tenore's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly thriving in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy violet or purple flower that blooms in late spring. Its intricate floral structure includes specialized petals and a prominent lip, typical of orchid morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
