                    <h1>Opuntia galerasensis</h1>
<p>Opuntia galerasensis, commonly known as the Galeras prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. Opuntia galerasensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the Cactaceae family.</p>
