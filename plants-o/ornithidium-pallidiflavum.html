                    <h1>Ornithidium pallidiflavum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium pallidiflavum, commonly known as the pale yellow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
