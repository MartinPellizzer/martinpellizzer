                    <h1>Orthrosanthus polystachyus</h1>
<p>Orthrosanthus polystachyus, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
