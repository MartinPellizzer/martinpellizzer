<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>araneola, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies araneola is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more delicate floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes.</p>
