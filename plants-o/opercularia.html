                    <h1>Opercularia</h1>
<p>Opercularia, commonly known as the "cap mushroom," is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their distinctive cap-shaped fruiting bodies, which often have a viscid or sticky surface. They are typically found in temperate regions, growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter. Opercularia species are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called gills, are attached to the underside of the cap and release spores into the air.</p>
