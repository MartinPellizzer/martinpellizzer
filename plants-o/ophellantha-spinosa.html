                    <h1>Ophellantha spinosa</h1>
<p>Ophellantha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ophellantha spinosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions.</p>
