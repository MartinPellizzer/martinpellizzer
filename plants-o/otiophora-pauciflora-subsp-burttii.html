<p>Otiophora pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's rock daisy, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often forming a compact, mat-like growth.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
