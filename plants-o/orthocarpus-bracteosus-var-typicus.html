<p>Orthocarpus bracteosus var. typicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orthocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological characteristics and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
