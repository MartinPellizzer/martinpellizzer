<p>Opuntia sabinii, commonly known as the Sabin's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Opuntia sabinii is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
