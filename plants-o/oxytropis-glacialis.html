                    <h1>Oxytropis glacialis</h1>
<p>Oxytropis glacialis, commonly known as glacier buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink, and its hairy, often blue-green leaves. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments, such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in these harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Oxytropis glacialis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low nutrient availability, making it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
