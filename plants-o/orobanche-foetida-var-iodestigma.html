                    <h1>Orobanche foetida var. iodestigma</h1>
<p>Orobanche foetida var. iodestigma, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers, and its roots are specialized for attaching to host roots. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its distinctive odor, which resembles that of a dead animal, is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
