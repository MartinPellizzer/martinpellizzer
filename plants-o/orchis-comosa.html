<p>Orchis comosa, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often arranged in a spike and lack a distinct lip, a feature common in many orchid species.</p>
<p>Orchis comosa is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
