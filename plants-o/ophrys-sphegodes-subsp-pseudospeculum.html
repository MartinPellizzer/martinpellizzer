<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>pseudospeculum, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
