                    <h1>Oxystophyllum araneum</h1>
<p>Oxystophyllum araneum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals that resemble the legs of a spider. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wet, swampy habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxystophyllum araneum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
