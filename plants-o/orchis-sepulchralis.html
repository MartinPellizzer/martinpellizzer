<p>Orchis sepulchralis, commonly known as the sepulchral orchid, is a rare and elusive species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale purple to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its name derives from its association with grave sites, though the exact reason for this connection remains unclear.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
