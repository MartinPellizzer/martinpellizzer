<p>Ononis polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control.</p>
<p>Ononis polyphylla is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
