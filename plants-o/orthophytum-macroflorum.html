<p>Orthophytum macroflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered orthophytum, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous vibrant orange flowers, which are often surrounded by long, narrow leaves. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
