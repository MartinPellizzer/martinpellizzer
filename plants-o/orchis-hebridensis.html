                    <h1>Orchis hebridensis</h1>
<p>Orchis hebridensis, commonly known as the Hebridean orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
