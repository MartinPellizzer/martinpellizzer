                    <h1>Ophioglossum konkanensis</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum konkanensis, commonly known as the Konkan adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted sporangia, which are clustered at the end of the fertile stalk. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, upright sterile frond and a separate, elongated fertile frond. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically in dense forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
