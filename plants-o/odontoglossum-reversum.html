<p>Odontoglossum reversum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a perennial orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or shoe, hence its common name.

<p>Odontoglossum reversum thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
