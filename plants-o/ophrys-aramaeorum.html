                    <h1>Ophrys aramaeorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys aramaeorum, commonly known as the Alaskan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in small, scattered populations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys aramaeorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
