                    <h1>Odotalon</h1>
<p>Odotalon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Odotalon thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments such as swamp forests.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
