<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>pollinensis, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Argolid region of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a key role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
