<p>Orchis incarnata var. altaica, commonly known as the highland lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream sides. Its tuberous roots are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive harsh winters.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata.</p>
