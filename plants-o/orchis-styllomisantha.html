                    <h1>Orchis styllomisantha</h1>
<p>Orchis styllomisantha, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex life cycle, often requiring a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries.</p>
