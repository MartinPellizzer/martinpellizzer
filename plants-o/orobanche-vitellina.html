                    <h1>Orobanche vitellina</h1>
<p>Orobanche vitellina, commonly known as the yellow barrenstar, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
