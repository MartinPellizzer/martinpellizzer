                    <h1>Ophrys × ptolemaea</h1>
<p>Ophrys × ptolemaea, commonly known as the Ptolemaic bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee or wasp to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its flowers are specialized for pseudocopulation, where male insects attempt to mate with the flower, inadvertently transferring pollen.</p>
<p>Ophrys × ptolemaea is a rare and protected species, often found in specific regions of Europe.</p>
