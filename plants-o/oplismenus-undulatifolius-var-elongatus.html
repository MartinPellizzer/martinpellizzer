                    <h1>Oplismenus undulatifolius var. elongatus</h1>
<p>Oplismenus undulatifolius var. elongatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive undulating pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wetland habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
