<p>Opuntia compressa var. austrina, commonly known as the Australian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and low rainfall.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its potential in sustainable agriculture.</p>
