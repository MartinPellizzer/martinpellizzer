                    <h1>Oxydectes subvillosa</h1>
<p>Oxydectes subvillosa, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, hairy stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silvery-green coloration.</p>
<p>Oxydectes subvillosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
