                            <h1>Orthopogon Bromoides</h1>
<p>Common bromegrass, scientifically known as Orthopogon bromoides, is a hardy perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sensitive ecosystems. Its slender leaves and delicate flowers make it a subtle yet important part of wetland habitats. Despite its modest appearance, Common bromegrass plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity.</p>
