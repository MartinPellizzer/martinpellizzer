                    <h1>Ophioglossum melipillense</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum melipillense, commonly known as the Melipillan adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, upright leaf with a long, narrow stalk and a broad, lance-shaped blade. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is considered a relict species with a limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
