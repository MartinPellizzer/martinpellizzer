<p>Orbignya, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into large, round fruits containing hard-shelled nuts. These nuts are rich in oil, which has been traditionally used for culinary and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Orbignya plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
