                    <h1>Orchis coriophora var. carpetana</h1>
<p>Orchis coriophora var. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive lip. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This orchid is relatively rare and is protected in several countries due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
