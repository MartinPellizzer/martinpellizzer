                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera var. apiformis</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera var. apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its vivid, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a pouch-shaped labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe. Its flowers are pollinated through a unique mimicry strategy, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the floral pseudomorph.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its delicate, greenish-yellow petals and its ability to thrive in sunny, open habitats.</p>
