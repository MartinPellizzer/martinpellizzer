<p>Ornithopteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies.</p>
