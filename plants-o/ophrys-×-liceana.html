<p>Ophrys × liceana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys lutea (the yellow bee orchid). This plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The flowers are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinct veining pattern that enhances their mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × liceana is found in various habitats across Europe, often in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil.</p>
