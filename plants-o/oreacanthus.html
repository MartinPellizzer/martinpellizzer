<p>Oreacanthus, commonly known as the mountain crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Oreacanthus species typically have lance-shaped leaves and are often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest to botanists due to their unique adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
