                    <h1>Olea welwitschii</h1>
<p>Olea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch olive, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Angola and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It is a slow-growing shrub or small tree with a deep root system that allows it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Olea welwitschii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
