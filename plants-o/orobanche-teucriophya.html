<p>Orobanche teucriophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a short, unbranched stem. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
