<p>Orobanche wierzbickii, commonly known as the Wierzbicki broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>

The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
