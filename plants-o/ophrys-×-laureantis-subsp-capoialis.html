<p>Ophrys × laureantis subsp.</p>
<p>capoialis, commonly known as the Capoian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its specialized floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
