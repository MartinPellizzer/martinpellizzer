                    <h1>Orobanche uniflora var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Orobanche uniflora var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple winter broom, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of small, showy purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in temperate regions. It parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume and aster families.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical structure and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
