<p>Orobanche parishii subsp.</p>
<p>brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in disturbed or arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
