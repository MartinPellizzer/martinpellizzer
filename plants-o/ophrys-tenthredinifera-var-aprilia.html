                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. aprilia</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. aprilia, commonly known as the April bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract pollinators through mimicry. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status.</p>
