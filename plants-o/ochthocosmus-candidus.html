<p>Ochthocosmus candidus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ochthocosmus candidus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
