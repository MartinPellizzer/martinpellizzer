                    <h1>Opuntia chlorotica</h1>
<p>Opuntia chlorotica, commonly known as the green prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pads covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, photosynthetic stems, a common adaptation in cacti.</p>
<p>Opuntia chlorotica is well adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall.</p>
