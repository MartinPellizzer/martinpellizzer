                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. aromatica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. aromatica, commonly known as fragrant rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its distinct aroma and flavor.</p>
<p>This plant is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is cultivated for its edible grains. The aromatic properties of this rice are due to the presence of compounds like 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which are released during cooking. It is primarily grown in regions with warm, humid climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Oryza sativa var. aromatica include tall, slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences that produce the rice grains.</p>
