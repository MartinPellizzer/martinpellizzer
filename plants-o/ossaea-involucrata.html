<p>Ossaea involucrata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Ossaea involucrata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
