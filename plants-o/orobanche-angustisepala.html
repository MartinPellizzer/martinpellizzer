                    <h1>Orobanche angustisepala</h1>
<p>Orobanche angustisepala, commonly known as the narrow-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
