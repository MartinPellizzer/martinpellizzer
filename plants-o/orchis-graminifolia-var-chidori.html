<p>Orchis graminifolia var. chidori, commonly known as the Chidori orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and have a delicate, fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
