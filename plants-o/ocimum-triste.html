                    <h1>Ocimum triste</h1>
<p>Ocimum triste, commonly known as bitter basil, is a member of the Lamiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that have a distinctively bitter flavor, which sets it apart from other basil varieties. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are small and pale blue or white, arranged in whorled clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Ocimum triste is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antispasmodic properties.</p>
