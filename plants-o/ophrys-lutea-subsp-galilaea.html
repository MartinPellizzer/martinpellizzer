<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>galilaea, commonly known as the Galilean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
