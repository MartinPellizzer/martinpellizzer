<p>Opuntia angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia angusta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscaping.</p>
