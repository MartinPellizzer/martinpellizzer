                    <h1>Orchis × bicknellii</h1>
<p>Orchis × bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits characteristics typical of the twayblade genus, including a slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, usually with purple or pink petals, and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical structure reflects a blend of its parent species, Orchis pallida and Orchis mascula, in both morphology and genetics.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in moist, shaded woodlands where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
