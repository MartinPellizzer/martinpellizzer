<p>Orthotactus felisbertianus, commonly known as the Felisbertian's Orthotactus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of fleshy, green leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pale yellow and green, which bloom during the short summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
