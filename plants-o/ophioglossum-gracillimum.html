                    <h1>Ophioglossum gracillimum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically narrow and elongated. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, broad, leathery leaf that is often divided into two lobes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
