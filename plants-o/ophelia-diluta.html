                    <h1>Ophelia diluta</h1>
<p>Ophelia diluta, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are divided into three parts. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Ophelia diluta thrives in still or slow-moving waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize water bodies make it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native regions.</p>
