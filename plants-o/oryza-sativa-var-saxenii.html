                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. saxenii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. saxenii, commonly known as the saxenic rice, is a wild rice species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, narrow leaves, and small, pale grains that differ from cultivated rice varieties. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its genome has been studied for its potential to contribute to rice breeding programs due to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Oryza sativa var. saxenii plays a role in ecological studies and may offer insights into rice evolution and adaptation.</p>
