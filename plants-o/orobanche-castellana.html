                    <h1>Orobanche castellana</h1>
<p>Orobanche castellana, commonly known as the Castilian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in Mediterranean regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with a short stem and clustered leaves. It parasitizes various species of legumes, including Vicia and Astragalus.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of roots and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite.</p>
