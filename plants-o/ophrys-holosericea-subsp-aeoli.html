<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>aeoli, commonly known as the Aeolian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimatic conditions of its coastal habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
