<p>Opuntia gracilis, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in small, soft spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits known as tunas. Opuntia gracilis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
