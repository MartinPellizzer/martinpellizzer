<p>Opuntia pilifera, commonly known as the hairless prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia pilifera is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping.</p>
