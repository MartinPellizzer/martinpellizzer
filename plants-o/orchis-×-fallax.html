                    <h1>Orchis × fallax</h1>
<p>Orchis × fallax, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural cross between Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system consists of a rhizome and tubers, which help it store nutrients and survive through adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects a blend of characteristics from its parent species, making it a fascinating example of hybridization in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
