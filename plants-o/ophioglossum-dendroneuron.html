                    <h1>Ophioglossum dendroneuron</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum dendroneuron, commonly known as the tree fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of feathery leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
