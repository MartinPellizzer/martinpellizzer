                    <h1>Ophioglossum moultonii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with separate male and female organs located on the same plant.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum moultonii is considered a relict species, reflecting its evolutionary history from the Carboniferous period.</p>
