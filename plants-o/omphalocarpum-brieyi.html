<p>Omphalocarpum brieyi, commonly known as the small-seeded burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule. Omphalocarpum brieyi is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
