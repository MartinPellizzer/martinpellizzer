                    <h1>Odontocline laciniata</h1>
<p>Odontocline laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Odontocline laciniata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
