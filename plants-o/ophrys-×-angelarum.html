                    <h1>Ophrys × angelarum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × angelarum, commonly known as the angel's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (waspy orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, often featuring a prominent "face" that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas or woodland edges.</p>
<p>This hybrid is notable for its unique pollination strategy and is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
