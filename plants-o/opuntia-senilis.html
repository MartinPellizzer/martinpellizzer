                    <h1>Opuntia senilis</h1>
<p>Opuntia senilis, commonly known as the old man of the south, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in clusters of small, spiny glochids, which are fine, hair-like structures that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia senilis is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
