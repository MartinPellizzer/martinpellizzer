                    <h1>Oxalis eggersii</h1>
<p>Oxalis eggersii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of common oxalis species. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky soils and full sunlight. It produces small, green, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oxalis eggersii is typically found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it blooms in spring and early summer.</p>
