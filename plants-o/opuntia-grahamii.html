                    <h1>Opuntia grahamii</h1>
<p>Opuntia grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>
<p>Opuntia grahamii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened structures.</p>
