                    <h1>Ophrys annae</h1>
<p>Ophrys annae, commonly known as the Annas' bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys annae is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
