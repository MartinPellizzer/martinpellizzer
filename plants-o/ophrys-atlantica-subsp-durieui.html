<p>Ophrys atlantica subsp.</p>
<p>durieui, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
