<p>Onobrychis paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces burr-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
