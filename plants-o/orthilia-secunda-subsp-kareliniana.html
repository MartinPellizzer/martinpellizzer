<p>Orthilia secunda subsp.</p>
<p>kareliniana, commonly known as the Karelin's bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, specialized leaves that function as traps to capture and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and bilaterally symmetrical, with distinctive purple or violet hues.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to its nutrient-deficient habitat, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
