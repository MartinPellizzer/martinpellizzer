                <h1>Ogastemma pusillum</h1>
<p>Ogastemma pusillum, commonly known as the small ogastemma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in wet meadows. Its small size and inconspicuous appearance make it easily overlooked in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ogastemma pusillum is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
