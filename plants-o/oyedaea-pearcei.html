<p>Oyedaea pearcei, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oyedaea pearcei is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
