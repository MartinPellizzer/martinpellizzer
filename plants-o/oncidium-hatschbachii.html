<p>Oncidium hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatshbach's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers with contrasting purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium hatschbachii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
