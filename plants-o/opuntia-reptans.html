<p>Opuntia reptans, commonly known as the creeping prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The stems are typically green to blue-green in color and can store water, allowing the plant to survive in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits.</p>
<p>Opuntia reptans is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance.</p>
