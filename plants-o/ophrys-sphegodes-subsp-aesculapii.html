<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>aesculapii, commonly known as the Apollo orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like labellum and a richly veined column. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
