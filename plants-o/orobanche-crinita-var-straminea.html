                    <h1>Orobanche crinita var. straminea</h1>
<p>Orobanche crinita var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils, particularly in areas with leguminous hosts. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves, which are adaptations for its parasitic lifestyle. It is native to parts of North America and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
