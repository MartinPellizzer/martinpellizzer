<p>Oreogrammitis pseudoxiphopteris, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, water-repellent scales. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where high humidity supports its growth.</p>
