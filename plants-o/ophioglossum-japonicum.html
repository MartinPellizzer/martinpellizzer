                    <h1>Ophioglossum japonicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tongue-like spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant produces two types of leaves: a sterile, photosynthetic leaf and a spore-producing leaf that is typically shorter and narrower. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in rocky or clay soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
