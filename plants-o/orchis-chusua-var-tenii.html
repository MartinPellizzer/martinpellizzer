                    <h1>Orchis chusua var. tenii</h1>
<p>Orchis chusua var. tenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
