                    <h1>Ophrys × muellneri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × muellneri, commonly known as the Müller's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female bees, a form of sexual deception. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Ophrys × muellneri results from crossbreeding between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, leading to unique floral characteristics.</p>
