                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera subvar. explanata</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera subvar. explanata, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it often has a subtle scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat loss, this subvariety is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
