<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>spruneri, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
