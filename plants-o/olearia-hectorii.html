<p>Olearia hectorii, commonly known as Hector's tree-fern, is a rare and endangered plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a single trunk and a crown of feathery leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. Olearia hectorii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in native forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
