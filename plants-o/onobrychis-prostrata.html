                    <h1>Onobrychis prostrata</h1>
<p>Onobrychis prostrata, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally used in forage and soil improvement practices.</p>
