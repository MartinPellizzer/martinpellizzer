                    <h1>Orchis traunsteineri</h1>
<p>Orchis traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike with several showy, lip-like petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
