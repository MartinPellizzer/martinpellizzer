                    <h1>Ophrys × cetonae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × cetonae, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys citrina (the yellow bee orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is notable for its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a form of sexual deception used to attract male bees for pollination. Ophrys × cetonae typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in meadows and grasslands across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of hybridization in orchids and its ecological interactions with pollinators.</p>
