<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets per branch. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, elongated shape, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis macrospicula is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
