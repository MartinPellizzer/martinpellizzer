                    <h1>Orobanche californica var. typica</h1>
<p>Orobanche californica var. typica, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it has limited ecological interactions beyond its host relationships.</p>
