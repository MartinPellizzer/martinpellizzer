<p>Odontosoria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive tooth fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often dichotomously branched fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Odontosoria decipiens is notable for its morphological adaptations that aid in its survival in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
