                    <h1>Orchis laxiflora var. dinsmorei</h1>
<p>Orchis laxiflora var. dinsmorei, commonly known as Dinsmore's looseflower orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its loose, racemose inflorescence and striking, pale pink to purple flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded habitats, often in rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
