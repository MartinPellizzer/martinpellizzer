                    <h1>Ophrys × sentinensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sentinensis, commonly known as the Sentinel Ophrys, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent, hairy lip to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates with adequate moisture. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals that enhance its mimicry of female bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys × sentinensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
