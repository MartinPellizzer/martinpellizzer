                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rice, is a variety of rice that is significantly smaller than typical rice plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, often reaching only a few inches in height, making it distinct from the standard Oryza sativa species. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to grow in wetland environments. Its small size makes it suitable for cultivation in limited spaces, such as home gardens or small-scale farms.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is often studied for its potential in agricultural research and conservation efforts.</p>
