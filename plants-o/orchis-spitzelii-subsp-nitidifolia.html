<p>Orchis spitzelii subsp.</p>
<p>nitidifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green, smooth leaves that distinguish it from other members of the genus.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers in late spring, typically arranged in a loose spike. It is mycotrophic, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
