                    <h1>Ophrys transhyrcana var. kojurensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys transhyrcana var. kojurensis, commonly known as the Kojarov's bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, thriving in temperate to cold climates. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
