                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. heliophila</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. This species typically parasitizes herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
