                    <h1>Opuntia ficus-indica f. reticulata</h1>
<p>Opuntia ficus-indica f. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in a dense layer of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The reticulate form refers to the distinctive, net-like pattern of its spines, which distinguishes it from other Opuntia species.</p>
