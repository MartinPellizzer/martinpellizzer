<p>Onobrychis pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Greece and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often growing in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies and has potential uses in forage and conservation efforts.</p>
