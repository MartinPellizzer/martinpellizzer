                    <h1>Oryzopsis seleri</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis seleri, commonly known as the Seler's false rice, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded meadows, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis seleri is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
