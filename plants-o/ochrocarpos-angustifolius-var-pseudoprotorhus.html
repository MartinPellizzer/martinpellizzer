                    <h1>Ochrocarpos angustifolius var. pseudoprotorhus</h1>
<p>Ochrocarpos angustifolius var. pseudoprotorhus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ochrocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, contributing to its resilience in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Ochrocarpos angustifolius.</p>
