<p>Ottelia cavaleriei, commonly known as the African water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>

The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are usually floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
