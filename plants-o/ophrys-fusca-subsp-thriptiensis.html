<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>thriptiensis, commonly known as the Thripiean bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
