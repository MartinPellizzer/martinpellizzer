                    <h1>Orobanche ambigua</h1>
<p>Orobanche ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species in the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
