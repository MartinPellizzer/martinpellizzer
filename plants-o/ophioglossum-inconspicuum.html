                    <h1>Ophioglossum inconspicuum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum inconspicuum, commonly known as the lesser adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, small, and often inconspicuous fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a primitive structure with a short, thick rhizome and a single, two-lobed leaf. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus.</p>
<p>This fern is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history.</p>
