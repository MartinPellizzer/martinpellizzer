                    <h1>Orobanche froelichii</h1>
<p>Orobanche froelichii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of host plants. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and can be a persistent weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
