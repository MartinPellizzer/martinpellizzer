<p>Oligodora, commonly known as the common orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and specialized root systems that allow them to thrive in various habitats. Oligodora species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Their flowers often feature a unique structure with three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified into a labellum.</p>
<p>Oligodora plants are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, where they contribute to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
