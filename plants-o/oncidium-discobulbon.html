<p>Oncidium discobulbon, commonly known as the disc-shaped bulb orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. Its roots are adapted for climbing and absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Oncidium discobulbon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
