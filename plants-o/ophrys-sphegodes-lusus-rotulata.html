                    <h1>Ophrys sphegodes lusus rotulata</h1>
<p>Ophrys sphegodes lusus rotulata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, yellowish lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns that aid in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
