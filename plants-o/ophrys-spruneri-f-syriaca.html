<p>Ophrys spruneri f. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinct coloration that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
