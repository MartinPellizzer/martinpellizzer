                    <h1>Orobanche epithymum var. pallescens</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymum var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale orobanche, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes various leguminous plants, forming a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth cycle of its host, and it is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
