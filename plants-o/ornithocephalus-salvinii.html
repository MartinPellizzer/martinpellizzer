<p>Ornithocephalus salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its unique floral structure includes specialized petals and a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithocephalus salvinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
