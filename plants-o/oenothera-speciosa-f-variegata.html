<p>Oenothera speciosa f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated evening primrose, is a striking perennial plant native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The variegation in its foliage is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in unique color patterns.</p>
