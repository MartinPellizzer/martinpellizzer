<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often in the understory of native forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthandra indeniensis is considered critically endangered, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
