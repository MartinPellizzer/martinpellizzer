                            <h1>Ophrys Quadriloba</h1>
<p>Ophrys quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Europe. It is renowned for its intricate flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its delicate flowers bloom in late spring, producing a subtle yet captivating fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys quadriloba is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
