                    <h1>Orchis umbrosa</h1>
<p>Orchis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the woodlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower that blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in deciduous forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Orchis umbrosa is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
