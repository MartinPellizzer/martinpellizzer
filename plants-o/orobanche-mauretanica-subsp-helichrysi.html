<p>Orobanche mauretanica subsp.</p>
<p>helichrysi, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true leaves and photosynthesizes through its stems, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It typically infests plants from the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
