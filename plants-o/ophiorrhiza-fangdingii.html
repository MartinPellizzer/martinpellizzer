<p>Ophiorrhiza fangdingii, commonly known as the Fangding's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows primarily on the branches of its host trees, such as those in the family Dipterocarpaceae, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stem, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza fangdingii is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
