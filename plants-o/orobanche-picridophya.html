                    <h1>Orobanche picridophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche picridophya, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes crops such as tomatoes and beans. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
