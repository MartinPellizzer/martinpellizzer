<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
