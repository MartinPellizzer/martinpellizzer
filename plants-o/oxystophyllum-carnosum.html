                    <h1>Oxystophyllum carnosum</h1>
<p>Oxystophyllum carnosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and aromatic, fragrant leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
