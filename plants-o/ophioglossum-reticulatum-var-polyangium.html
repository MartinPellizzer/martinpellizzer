                    <h1>Ophioglossum reticulatum var. polyangium</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum reticulatum var. polyangium, commonly known as the reticulate adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces large, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
