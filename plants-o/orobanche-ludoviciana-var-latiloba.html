                    <h1>Orobanche ludoviciana var. latiloba</h1>
<p>Orobanche ludoviciana var. latiloba, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-colored, thread-like stems that coil around its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
