                    <h1>Ophioglossum capense</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum capense, commonly known as the Cape adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, tongue-shaped leaf that emerges from a short, horizontal rhizome. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the leaf margins, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum capense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
