                    <h1>Ochrocephala</h1>
<p>Ochrocephala, commonly known as the goldenhead orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. Ochrocephala species are characterized by their striking, yellowish-green flowers that often have a distinct golden hue. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Ochrocephala is important for understanding orchid diversity and ecological adaptations in tropical ecosystems.</p>
