<p>Oeceoclades splendida, commonly known as the splendid staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, branching fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are covered in a dense layer of moss-like tissue called a velamen, which helps it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Oeceoclades splendida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
