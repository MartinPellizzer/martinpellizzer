<p>Ouratella finlayi, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its morphology is adapted for both photosynthesis and carnivory, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The species is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it plays a minor role in local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
