                    <h1>Orobanche weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Orobanche weberbaueri, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on host plants for most of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, often found growing on plants like grasses and shrubs.</p>
