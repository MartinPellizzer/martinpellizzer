<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>leochroma, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lower lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The subspecies leochroma is distinguished by its slightly different coloration and floral structure compared to other subspecies of Ophrys tenthredinifera.</p>
