<p>Onopordum micropterum, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, purple flowers and gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
