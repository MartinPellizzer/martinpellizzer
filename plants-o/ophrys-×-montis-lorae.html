                    <h1>Ophrys × montis-lorae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × montis-lorae, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulatory structures.</p>
