                    <h1>Ostryoderris lucida var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Ostryoderris lucida var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender whitebark, is a variant of the whitebark tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in New Zealand's botanical diversity.</p>
