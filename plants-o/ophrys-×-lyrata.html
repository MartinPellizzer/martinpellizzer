<p>Ophrys × lyrata, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys fusca (the fly orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive flowers, which mimic the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with several showy, bee-like flowers that are highly specialized for mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × lyrata is typically found in grassy habitats and is known for its ecological role in supporting pollinator interactions.</p>
