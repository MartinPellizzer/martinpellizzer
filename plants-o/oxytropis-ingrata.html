                    <h1>Oxytropis ingrata</h1>
<p>Oxytropis ingrata, commonly known as the Indian needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small, pea-like pods. Its leaves are typically small, compound, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Oxytropis ingrata is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
