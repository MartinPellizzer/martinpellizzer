<p>Otites, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, consists of several species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which are made up of numerous small florets arranged in a circular pattern. Otites typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, often inconspicuous flowers that may be yellow or white in color. They are often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
