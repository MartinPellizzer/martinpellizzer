                    <h1>Ophrys × waldmanniana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × waldmanniana, commonly known as the Waldmann's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a prominent, yellow-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the floral mimic, a form of sexual deception.</p>
<p>Ophrys × waldmanniana is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and lanceolate leaves.</p>
