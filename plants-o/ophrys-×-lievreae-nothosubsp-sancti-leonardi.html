<p>Ophrys × lievreae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>sancti-leonardi, commonly known as the Saint Leonard's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of hybridization between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys lutea, showcasing the diversity within the Ophrys genus.</p>
