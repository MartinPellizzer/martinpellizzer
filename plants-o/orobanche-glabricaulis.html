                    <h1>Orobanche glabricaulis</h1>
<p>Orobanche glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
