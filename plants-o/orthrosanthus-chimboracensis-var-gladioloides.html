                    <h1>Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. gladioloides</h1>
<p>Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. gladioloides, commonly known as the Andean gladioloid orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high Andes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that resemble those of the gladiolus, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing vibrant purple or violet flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
