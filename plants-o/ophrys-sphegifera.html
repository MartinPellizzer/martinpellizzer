<p>Ophrys sphegifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a fascinating orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its highly specialized floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. This mimicry plays a crucial role in attracting male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually a combination of brown, yellow, and white, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance.</p>
