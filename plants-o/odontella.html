<p>Odontella, commonly known as the "sea saw" or "sea star," is a genus of unicellular, freshwater algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>These diatoms are characterized by their intricate, silica-based cell walls, which form complex, symmetrical patterns. Odontella species are typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, where they play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. They are photosynthetic, contributing to primary productivity and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological significance make them important indicators of water quality and environmental health.</p>
