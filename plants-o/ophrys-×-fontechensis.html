<p>Ophrys × fontechensis, commonly known as the Fontecheche orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-like flowers with a specialized structure called a labellum, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in rocky and woodland habitats, preferring cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
