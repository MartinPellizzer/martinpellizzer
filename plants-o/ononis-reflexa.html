                    <h1>Ononis reflexa</h1>
<p>Ononis reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ononis reflexa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes.</p>
