                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. glaberrima, commonly known as the small broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is highly dependent on the presence of specific host species, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
