                    <h1>Orchis romana lusus bicolor</h1>
<p>Orchis romana lusus bicolor, commonly known as the Two-colored Heath Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, typically featuring a pale pink or white lip and a darker, often purple or brown upper part. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, this orchid thrives in calcareous soils and open, sunny habitats. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense colonies in rocky or grassy areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
