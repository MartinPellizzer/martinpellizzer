                    <h1>Orchis flava var. virescens</h1>
<p>Orchis flava var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>
