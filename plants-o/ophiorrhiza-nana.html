                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza nana</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza nana, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove or small mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has small, simple leaves that are alternate and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza nana is adapted to tidal fluctuations and can tolerate periodic submersion, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
