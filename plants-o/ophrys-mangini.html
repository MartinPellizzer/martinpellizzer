                    <h1>Ophrys mangini</h1>
<p>Ophrys mangini, commonly known as the Mangini's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized pouch at the base, designed to receive pollen from visiting insects. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys mangini is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
