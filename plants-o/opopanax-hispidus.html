                    <h1>Opopanax hispidus</h1>
<p>Opopanax hispidus, commonly known as the hairy opopanax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant is a small shrub with woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its resin, used historically for incense and medicinal purposes, is highly valued for its unique scent and purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
