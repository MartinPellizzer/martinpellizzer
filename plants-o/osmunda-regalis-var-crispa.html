                    <h1>Osmunda regalis var. crispa</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis var. crispa, commonly known as the curly water fern, is a variant of the royal fern that is distinguished by its finely curled fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is native to wetlands and riparian zones in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive zigzag or curling pattern along their edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
