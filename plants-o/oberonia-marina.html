                    <h1>Oberonia marina</h1>
<p>Oberonia marina, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species found primarily in coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling orchids in appearance but with distinct structural features. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing on rocky or sandy substrates near the coast. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia marina is considered a conservation concern.</p>
