                    <h1>Orobanche cypria</h1>
<p>Orobanche cypria, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to anchor itself to the host. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
