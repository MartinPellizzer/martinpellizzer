<p>Orbea sprengeri subsp.</p>
<p>ogadensis, commonly known as the Ogaden orbea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of East Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
