<p>Oligosporus dracunculus subsp.</p>
<p>dracunculinus, commonly known as the dragonhead orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring long, narrow petals that resemble the scales of a dragon.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
