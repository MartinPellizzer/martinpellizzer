                    <h1>Ophrys lucifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys lucifera, commonly known as the Venus's Flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique snapping leaves that close rapidly around insect prey. The plant's leaves are modified into trap-like structures with sensitive trigger hairs that initiate the closure mechanism. Ophrys lucifera thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and requires a humid, acidic environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Its ability to capture and digest insects allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its natural habitat.</p>
