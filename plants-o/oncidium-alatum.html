<p>Oncidium alatum, commonly known as the flying spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, brightly colored flowers resembling spiders. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Oncidium alatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
