<p>Ononis spinosa subsp.</p>
<p>procurrens, commonly known as creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more prostrate growth habit compared to the typical form of Ononis spinosa.</p>
