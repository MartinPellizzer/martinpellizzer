                    <h1>Oberonia sedgwickii</h1>
<p>Oberonia sedgwickii, commonly known as the Sedgwick's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the montane forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia sedgwickii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
