<p>Oreogrammitis imberbis, commonly known as the barren wall fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely packed, dark green to brownish-green foliage that forms a dense mat on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a structure composed of short, branching shoots with leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis imberbis is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
