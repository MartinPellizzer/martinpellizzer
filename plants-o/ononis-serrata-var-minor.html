The plant produces clusters of pink or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, rounded capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
