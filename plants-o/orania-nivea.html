<p>Orania nivea, commonly known as the white orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and slender, elegant stems that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms that are typically short-lived but highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. Orania nivea thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
