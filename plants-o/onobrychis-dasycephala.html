<p>Onobrychis dasycephala, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
