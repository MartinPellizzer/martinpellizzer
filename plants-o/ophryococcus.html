                    <h1>Ophryococcus</h1>
<p>Ophryococcus, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Ophryococcus species are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and small, intricate flowers that often resemble those of other orchid genera. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks, and require well-draining soil and consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in horticulture, though they are not as widely grown as other orchid genera.</p>
