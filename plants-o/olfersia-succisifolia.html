                    <h1>Olfersia succisifolia</h1>
<p>Olfersia succisifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis, making it a unique adaptation to its shaded habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
