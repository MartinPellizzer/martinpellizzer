<p>Oryzopsis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Oryzopsis alpestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
