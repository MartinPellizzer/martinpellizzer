<p>Osmunda regalis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, which are distinctive cone-like structures at the end of the fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda regalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
