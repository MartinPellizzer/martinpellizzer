                    <h1>Oenotrichia tenera</h1>
<p>Oenotrichia tenera, commonly known as the slender leafed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and its pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown upon maturity. Oenotrichia tenera is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
