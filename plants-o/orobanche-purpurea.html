                    <h1>Orobanche purpurea</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurea, commonly known as the purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often tubular flowers. The plant produces small, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems as a specialist herbivore.</p>
