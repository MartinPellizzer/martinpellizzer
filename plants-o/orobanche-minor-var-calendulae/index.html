                            <h1>Orobanche Minor Var. Calendulae</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. calendulae is a parasitic flowering plant that thrives by drawing nutrients from host plants. It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed soils where its hosts, such as calendula, are present. This plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for survival. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to the landscape. Despite its delicate appearance, it can be a nuisance to gardeners due to its parasitic nature.</p>
