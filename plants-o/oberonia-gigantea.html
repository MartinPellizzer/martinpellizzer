<p>Oberonia gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Oberonia gigantea is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
