<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>souchei, commonly known as the southern bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
