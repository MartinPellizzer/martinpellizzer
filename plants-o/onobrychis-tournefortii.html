                    <h1>Onobrychis tournefortii</h1>
<p>Onobrychis tournefortii, commonly known as French broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural areas.</p>
