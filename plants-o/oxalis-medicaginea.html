                    <h1>Oxalis medicaginea</h1>
<p>Oxalis medicaginea, commonly known as the medicinal oxalis, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers, making it monoecious, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, but the plant has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Oxalis medicaginea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
