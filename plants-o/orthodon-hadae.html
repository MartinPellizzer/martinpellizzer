                    <h1>Orthodon hadae</h1>
<p>Orthodon hadae, commonly known as the Namib Desert orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique adaptation to extreme aridity, featuring a thick, fleshy rhizome for water storage. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow or greenish flowers during the brief rainy season, typically in late winter. Its survival depends on ephemeral water sources, making it highly sensitive to climate change.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered endangered and protected in its native habitat.</p>
