                    <h1>Orobanche kelleri</h1>
<p>Orobanche kelleri, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
