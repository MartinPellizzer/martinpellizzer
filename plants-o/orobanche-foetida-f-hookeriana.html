                    <h1>Orobanche foetida f. hookeriana</h1>
<p>Orobanche foetida f. hookeriana, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for attaching to host roots, forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
