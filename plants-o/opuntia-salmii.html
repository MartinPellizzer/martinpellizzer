<p>Opuntia salmii, commonly known as the Salmi's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia salmii is also noted for its ability to store water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
