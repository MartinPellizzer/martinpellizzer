                    <h1>Ophrys pseudospeculum var. araneola</h1>
<p>Ophrys pseudospeculum var. araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a spider, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized structure called a labellum, which attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
