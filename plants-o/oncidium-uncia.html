                    <h1>Oncidium uncia</h1>
<p>Oncidium uncia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin, white or pale green inflorescence that resembles a ghostly shape, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom in clusters, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip.</p>
<p>Oncidium uncia is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, though it is often protected in its native habitats.</p>
