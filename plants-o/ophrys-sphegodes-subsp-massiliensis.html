<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific microhabitats such as limestone cliffs and open woodlands. Its floral morphology is highly adapted for pseudocopulation, a strategy that enhances its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
