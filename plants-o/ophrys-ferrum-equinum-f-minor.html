                    <h1>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. minor</h1>
<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. minor, commonly known as the lesser copper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale brown or reddish-brown, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
