                    <h1>Opuntia albispinosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia albispinosa, commonly known as the white-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems covered in white spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia albispinosa plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
