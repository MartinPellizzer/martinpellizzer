<p>Orobanche minor subsp.</p>
<p>alsatica, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red.</p>
<p>This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
