<p>Opuntia lagunae, commonly known as the Laguna prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Opuntia lagunae is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
