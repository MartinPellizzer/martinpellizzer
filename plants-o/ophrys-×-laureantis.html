                    <h1>Ophrys × laureantis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × laureantis, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys scrobiculata (the yellow bee orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × laureantis is native to southern Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
