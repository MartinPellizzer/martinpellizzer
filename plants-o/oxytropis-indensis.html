                    <h1>Oxytropis indensis</h1>
<p>Oxytropis indensis, commonly known as Indian locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis indensis is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>
