<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>andria, commonly known as the Andria bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
