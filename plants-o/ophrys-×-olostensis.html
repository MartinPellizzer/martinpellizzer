                    <h1>Ophrys × olostensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × olostensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized lip that plays a key role in pollination by attracting male bees. Ophrys × olostensis thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying plant-pollinator interactions and hybridization in orchids.</p>
