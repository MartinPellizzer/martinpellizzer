                    <h1>Oxytropis proxima</h1>
<p>Oxytropis proxima, commonly known as desert locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with erect, branching stems that bear small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Oxytropis proxima is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
