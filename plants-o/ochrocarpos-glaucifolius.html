                    <h1>Ochrocarpos glaucifolius</h1>
<p>Ochrocarpos glaucifolius, commonly known as the bluish-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Ochrocarpos glaucifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
