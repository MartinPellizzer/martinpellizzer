<p>Oenothera perennis f. rectipilis, commonly known as the upright evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it easily distinguishable from other evening primrose varieties. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its upright growth habit, which is a distinguishing feature from the more sprawling forms of Oenothera perennis.</p>
