                    <h1>Orobanche congesta</h1>
<p>Orobanche congesta, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing in the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield.</p>
