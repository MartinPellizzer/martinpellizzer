<p>Orobanche salviae subsp.</p>
<p>echinopis, commonly known as the echinopis broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it a specialized and ecologically significant plant in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many regions.</p>
