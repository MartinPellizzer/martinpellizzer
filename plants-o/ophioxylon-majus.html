                    <h1>Ophioxylon majus</h1>
<p>Ophioxylon majus, commonly known as the giant horned wood, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems covered in prominent, horn-like spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are leathery and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, Ophioxylon majus is often found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
