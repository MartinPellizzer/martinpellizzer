                    <h1>Oberonia meegaskumburae</h1>
<p>Oberonia meegaskumburae, commonly known as the Sri Lankan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to the humid, shaded environment of the understory.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oberonia meegaskumburae is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
