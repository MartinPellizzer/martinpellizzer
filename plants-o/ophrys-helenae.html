                    <h1>Ophrys helenae</h1>
<p>Ophrys helenae, commonly known as the Helen's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys helenae is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
