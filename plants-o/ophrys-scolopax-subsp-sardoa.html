<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
