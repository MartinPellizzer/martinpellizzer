                    <h1>Orobanche curvata</h1>
<p>Orobanche curvata, commonly known as the curved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, typically those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
