<p>Orchis morio var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various parts of Europe.</p>
<p>This orchid is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It features a slender, grass-like stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its lack of showy petals, with the flowers being mostly reduced to a hood-like structure.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake.</p>
