                    <h1>Ophrys × bergonii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × bergonii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a labellum that resembles a bee's body, enhancing its effectiveness as a pollination mimic.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes Ophrys × bergonii an important example of plant-pollinator co-evolution.</p>
