                    <h1>Ophrys × auroi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × auroi, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a yellow and brown coloration with intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the floral mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × auroi is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy inflorescence.</p>
