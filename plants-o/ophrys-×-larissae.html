                    <h1>Ophrys × larissae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × larissae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys fucata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with petals resembling the shape and coloration of female bees, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are specialized to mimic the appearance of bees, attracting male bees for pollination through a process known as pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>This orchid is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
