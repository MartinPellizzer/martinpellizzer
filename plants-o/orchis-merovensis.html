<p>Orchis merovensis, commonly known as the Merovingian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Orchis merovensis is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
