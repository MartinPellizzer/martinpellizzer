                    <h1>Odontosoria intermedia</h1>
<p>Odontosoria intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate tooth fern, is a vascular epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like pinnae that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, upright clumps with long, narrow fronds. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Odontosoria intermedia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
