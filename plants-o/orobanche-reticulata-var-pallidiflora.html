<p>Orobanche reticulata var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system for attaching to host roots. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that are typically arranged in a dense spike. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
