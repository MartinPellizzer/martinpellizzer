                    <h1>Ozothamnus</h1>
<p>Ozothamnus, commonly known as the golden everlasting or silverleaf daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are typically silver or gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ozothamnus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>They produce yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
