                    <h1>Ophrys × pizzulensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pizzulensis, commonly known as the Pizzulensis bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of the Italian Dolomites. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. Its botanical characteristics include a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single flowering stem.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological significance and is often found in moist, calcareous soils at higher elevations.</p>
