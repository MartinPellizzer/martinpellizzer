                    <h1>Olea europaea var. nigerrima</h1>
<p>Olea europaea var. nigerrima, commonly known as the black olive tree, is a rare and ancient variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruit, which sets it apart from the more common green or yellow olives. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, leathery texture. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a long, warm growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plant species.</p>
