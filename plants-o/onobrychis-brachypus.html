<p>Onobrychis brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Onobrychis brachypus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>
