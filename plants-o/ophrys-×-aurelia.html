                    <h1>Ophrys × aurelia</h1>
<p>Ophrys × aurelia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (waspy orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow coloration and intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a female bee. This mimicry is a key adaptation for attracting male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats across southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its unique floral morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and mimicry.</p>
