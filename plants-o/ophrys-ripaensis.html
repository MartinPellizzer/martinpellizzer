                    <h1>Ophrys ripaensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys ripaensis, commonly known as the riparian bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riparian zones of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that are specialized for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers have a complex structure, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>Ophrys ripaensis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes.</p>
