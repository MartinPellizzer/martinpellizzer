<p>Ornithoxanthum sternbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant is typically low-growing, with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Ornithoxanthum sternbergii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
