<p>Oreobolus clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden sand sedge, is a small, perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or salt lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its flowers are usually brown or pale green, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Oreobolus clandestinus is often found in coastal or inland saline areas, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
