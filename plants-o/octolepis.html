<p>Octolepis, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are often covered in sharp, prickly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Octolepis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
