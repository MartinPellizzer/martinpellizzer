<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>elbursana, commonly known as the Elburs bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Elburs Mountains in Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
