<p>Onobrychis viciifolia var. montana, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil.</p>
