                    <h1>Ornithopodium missus</h1>
<p>Ornithopodium missus, commonly known as the New Zealand spider-orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem and small, delicate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, typically with five to seven blooms, each having three petals and three sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
