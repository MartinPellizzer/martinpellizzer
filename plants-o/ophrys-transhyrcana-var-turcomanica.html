                    <h1>Ophrys transhyrcana var. turcomanica</h1>
<p>Ophrys transhyrcana var. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
