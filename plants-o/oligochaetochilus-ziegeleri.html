                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus ziegeleri</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus ziegeleri, commonly known as the Ziegeler's mossy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, moss-like foliage that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with faintly colored lips, adapted for specific pollinators. It is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
