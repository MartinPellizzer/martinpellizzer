<p>Orchis purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, violet to purple flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are relatively narrow compared to other orchid species, contributing to its subspecific distinction. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important component of its local ecosystem.</p>
