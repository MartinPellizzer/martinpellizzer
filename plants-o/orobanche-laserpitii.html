<p>Orobanche laserpitii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. It is native to Mediterranean regions and is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
