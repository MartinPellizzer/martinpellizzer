                    <h1>Ophrys hittitica</h1>
<p>Ophrys hittitica, commonly known as the Hittite bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys hittitica is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
