<p>Orthopogon agrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Orthopogon agrostoides is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats.</p>
