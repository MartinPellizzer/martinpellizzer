                    <h1>Opuntia whipplei var. enodis</h1>
<p>Opuntia whipplei var. enodis, commonly known as the Hawaiian prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to the arid climate of Hawaii.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in traditional Hawaiian culture and its use in local cuisine.</p>
