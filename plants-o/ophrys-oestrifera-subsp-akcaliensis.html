<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>akcaliensis, commonly known as the Akcali Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
