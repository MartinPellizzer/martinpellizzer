                    <h1>Orobanche gracilis f. tetuanensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche gracilis f. tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to regions of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies and ecological research.</p>
