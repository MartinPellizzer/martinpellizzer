                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus macrocalymma</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus macrocalymma, commonly known as the large calyx moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has small, closely packed leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This moss is an important component of microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
