<p>Orobus lacteus var. multijugus, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical or subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance for certain insects, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings.</p>
