                    <h1>Otophora resecta</h1>
<p>Otophora resecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf otophora, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otophora resecta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
