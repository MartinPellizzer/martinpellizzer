<p>Osmoxylon arrhenicum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, candle-like growth habit, with thick, woody stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Osmoxylon arrhenicum is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes.</p>
