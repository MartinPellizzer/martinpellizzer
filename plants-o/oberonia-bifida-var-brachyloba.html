                    <h1>Oberonia bifida var. brachyloba</h1>
<p>Oberonia bifida var. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked bifid oberonia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of green and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
