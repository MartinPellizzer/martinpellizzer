                    <h1>Ophioglossum usterianum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum usterianum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, tongue-shaped sporophylls that bear spores on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with separate male and female sporangia on different parts of the plant.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum usterianum is considered a living fossil due to its primitive features and limited distribution.</p>
