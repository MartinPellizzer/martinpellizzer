                    <h1>Orchis × weddellii</h1>
<p>Orchis × weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the UK and Ireland. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
