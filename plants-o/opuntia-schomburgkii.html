<p>Opuntia schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia schomburgkii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and other practical purposes.</p>
