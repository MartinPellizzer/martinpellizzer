                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. pudica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. pudica, commonly known as the shy rice or the bashful rice plant, is a less commonly cultivated variant of rice.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that tend to close at night or when disturbed, giving it its common name. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other rice species.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup and morphological traits make it an interesting subject for botanical research and potential agricultural use.</p>
