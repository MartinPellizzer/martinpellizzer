<p>Oreophilus cordilabius, commonly known as the mountain heartleaf, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oreophilus cordilabius is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
