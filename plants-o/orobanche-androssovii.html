                    <h1>Orobanche androssovii</h1>
<p>Orobanche androssovii, commonly known as the red root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish stems. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is commonly found in regions with suitable host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
