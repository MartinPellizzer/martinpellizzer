<p>Opuntia azurea, commonly known as the Azure prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia azurea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a notable species in desert ecosystems.</p>
