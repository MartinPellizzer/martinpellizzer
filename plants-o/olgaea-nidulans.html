<p>Olgaea nidulans, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Olgaea nidulans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
