                    <h1>Ophrys camusii</h1>
<p>Ophrys camusii, commonly known as the Camus's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys camusii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
