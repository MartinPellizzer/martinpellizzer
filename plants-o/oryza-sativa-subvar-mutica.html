                    <h1>Oryza sativa subvar. mutica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa subvar. mutica, commonly known as the wild rice of Southeast Asia, is a grass species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and has a complex genome structure, making it a valuable genetic resource for rice breeding programs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with long, narrow leaves and spikelet clusters that bear the grains. Its ecological role includes supporting aquatic biodiversity and serving as a food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is also studied for its potential in improving the resilience of cultivated rice varieties.</p>
