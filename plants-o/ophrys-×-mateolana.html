                    <h1>Ophrys × mateolana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mateolana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions of Europe, thriving in calcareous soils and open habitats.</p>
