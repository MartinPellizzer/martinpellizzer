                    <h1>Ophioglossum pumilum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum pumilum, commonly known as the little adder's tongue fern, is a small, primitive fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically found on the underside of its leaves. The plant is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions and has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, grass-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a short-lived, spore-producing gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophioglossum pumilum is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
