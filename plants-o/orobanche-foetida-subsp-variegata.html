<p>Orobanche foetida subsp.</p>
<p>variegata, commonly known as the spotted broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and typically infests members of the legume family.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or white and are arranged in a spiky inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
