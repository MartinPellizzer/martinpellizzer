                    <h1>Opuntia leptocaulis f. vaginata</h1>
<p>Opuntia leptocaulis f. vaginata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has small, paddle-shaped stems that store water efficiently.</p>
<p>The f. vaginata form is distinguished by its reduced stem size and a more compact growth habit compared to the standard Opuntia leptocaulis.</p>
