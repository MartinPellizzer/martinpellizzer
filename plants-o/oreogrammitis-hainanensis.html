<p>Oreogrammitis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan wall-rue, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, delicate ferns typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with closely spaced, ovate-lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, appressed hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
