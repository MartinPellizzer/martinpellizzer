                    <h1>Oreocallis wickhamii</h1>
<p>Oreocallis wickhamii, commonly known as Wickham's clivernut, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreocallis wickhamii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
