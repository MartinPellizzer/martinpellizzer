                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza baviensis</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza baviensis, commonly known as Bavi's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Vietnam. This plant lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis through its leaves. It typically attaches to the branches of trees such as Ficus species, forming a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza baviensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
