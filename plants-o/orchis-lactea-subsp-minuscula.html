<p>Orchis lactea subsp.</p>
<p>minuscula, commonly known as the small milk orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
