<p>Opuntia calcicola, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, spine-tipped stems that are adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia calcicola plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
