<p>Orobanche ritro, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that can vary in color depending on the host. It is found in various regions of Europe and is particularly common in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
