                    <h1>Odontites viscosus</h1>
<p>Odontites viscosus, commonly known as sticky odontite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sticky secretions on the leaves are thought to deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Odontites viscosus is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
