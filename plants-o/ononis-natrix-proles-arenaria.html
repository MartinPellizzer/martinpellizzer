<p>Ononis natrix proles arenaria, commonly known as the sand hopper or sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations.</p>
