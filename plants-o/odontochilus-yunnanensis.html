<p>Odontochilus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
