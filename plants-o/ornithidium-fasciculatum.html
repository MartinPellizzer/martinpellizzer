                    <h1>Ornithidium fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters and are used for asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Ornithidium fasciculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
