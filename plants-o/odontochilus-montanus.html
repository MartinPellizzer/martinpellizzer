                    <h1>Odontochilus montanus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
