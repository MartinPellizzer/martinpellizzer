                    <h1>Ophrys × franciniae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × franciniae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys × franciniae is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
