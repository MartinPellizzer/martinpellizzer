<p>Ophrys umbilicata subsp.</p>
<p>lapethica, commonly known as the Lapethic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in rocky or sandy environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry of its pollinator target.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
