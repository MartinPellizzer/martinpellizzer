<p>Ophrys kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>ariadnae, commonly known as the Ariadna's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
