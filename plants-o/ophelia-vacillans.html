                    <h1>Ophelia vacillans</h1>
<p>Ophelia vacillans, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the water's edge. Ophelia vacillans thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
