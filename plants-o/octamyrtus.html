                    <h1>Octamyrtus</h1>
<p>Octamyrtus, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and salty air. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Octamyrtus species are often used in landscaping for their hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, some species have been traditionally used in Indigenous Australian medicine.</p>
