                    <h1>Orobanche heyniae</h1>
<p>Orobanche heyniae, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are often yellow or reddish in color. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, often a member of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
