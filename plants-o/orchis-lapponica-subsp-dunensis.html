                    <h1>Orchis lapponica subsp. dunensis</h1>
<p>Orchis lapponica subsp.</p>
<p>dunensis, commonly known as the Lapland orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils in alpine or subarctic habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy, violet or purple flower with a distinctive lip, which is characteristic of many orchid species. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
