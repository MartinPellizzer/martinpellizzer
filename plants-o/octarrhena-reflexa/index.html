                            <h1>Octarrhena Reflexa</h1>
<p>Common milkweed, scientifically known as Octarrhena reflexa, is a hardy perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient addition to xeriscaped gardens. The plant features slender stems and clusters of small, pale green to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milkweed species are vital for supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Despite its modest appearance, Octarrhena reflexa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
