                    <h1>Oncella poecilobotrys</h1>
<p>Oncella poecilobotrys, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a distinctive helical pattern around the central axis. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures that perform similar functions.</p>
<p>Oncella poecilobotrys plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
