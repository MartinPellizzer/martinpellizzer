<p>Odontites serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>rothmaleri, commonly known as Rothmaler's alpine toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, pinnately lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like structures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its hibernating seeds, which remain dormant for several years before germinating under favorable conditions.</p>
