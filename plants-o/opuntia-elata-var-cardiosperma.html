                    <h1>Opuntia elata var. cardiosperma</h1>
<p>Opuntia elata var. cardiosperma, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spine-tipped pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The fruit, which develops from the flower, is a small, fleshy pear-shaped structure that contains edible seeds.</p>
