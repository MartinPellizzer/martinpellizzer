                    <h1>Osmia serratuloides</h1>
<p>Osmia serratuloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved squash bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, metallic blue body and yellow-orange markings, which help in thermoregulation. The plant it pollinates, primarily members of the Cucurbitaceae family, such as squash and pumpkins, relies on its specialized pollen-carrying structures. Osmia serratuloides plays a crucial role in the pollination of these economically important crops.</p>
<p>Its behavior and morphology are well-adapted to its ecological niche within agricultural and wild landscapes.</p>
