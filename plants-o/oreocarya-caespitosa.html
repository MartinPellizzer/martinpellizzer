<p>Oreocarya caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in steep, unstable terrain.</p>
