                            <h1>Oldeania Humbertii</h1>
<p>Humbert's olive, scientifically known as Oldeania humbertii, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. This evergreen shrub is distinguished by its striking silver-green foliage and small, olive-like fruits that mature to a dark purple hue. Despite its name, it is not closely related to true olives but is instead part of the daisies family, Asteraceae. Found primarily in Tanzania and Kenya, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Humbert's olive is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
