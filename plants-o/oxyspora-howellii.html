<p>Oxyspora howellii, commonly known as Howell's oxyspora, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
