<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>arachnitiformis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a spider, a key adaptation for its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns that attract male wasps, which it deceives into attempting to mate with the flower. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions.</p>
