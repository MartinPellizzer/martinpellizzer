<p>Orobanche uniflora var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single umbel, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>
