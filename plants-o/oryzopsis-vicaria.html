                    <h1>Oryzopsis vicaria</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis vicaria, commonly known as the slender false rice, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis vicaria is often mistaken for rice due to its similar appearance, but it is not cultivated for agricultural purposes.</p>
