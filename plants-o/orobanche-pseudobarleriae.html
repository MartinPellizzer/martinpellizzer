                    <h1>Orobanche pseudobarleriae</h1>
<p>Orobanche pseudobarleriae, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish stems and clusters of small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
