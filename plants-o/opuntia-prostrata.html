                    <h1>Opuntia prostrata</h1>
<p>Opuntia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to southern North America and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The stems are covered in small, spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers during the summer months. After flowering, it produces small, red or yellow fruits that are edible and rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</p>
