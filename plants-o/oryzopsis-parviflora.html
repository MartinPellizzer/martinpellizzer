                    <h1>Oryzopsis parviflora</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, pale green spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-gray appearance that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis parviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
