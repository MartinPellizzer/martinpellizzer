                    <h1>Onobrychis tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Onobrychis tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
