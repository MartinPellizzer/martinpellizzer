                    <h1>Oreocereus hendriksenianus</h1>
<p>Oreocereus hendriksenianus, commonly known as the Hendriksen's candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spindly stems that often branch into a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the branches. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for air circulation.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
