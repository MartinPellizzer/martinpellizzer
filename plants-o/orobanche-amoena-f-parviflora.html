                    <h1>Orobanche amoena f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche amoena f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often yellowish or greenish, floral structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of various host species such as legumes or grasses. Its small, clustered flowers are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops, making it both ecologically and economically significant.</p>
