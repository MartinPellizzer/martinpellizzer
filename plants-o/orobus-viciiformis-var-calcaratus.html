                    <h1>Orobus viciiformis var. calcaratus</h1>
<p>Orobus viciiformis var. calcaratus, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The varietal name *calcaratus* refers to the calcareous (lime-rich) soils in which it typically grows.</p>
