                    <h1>Orthiopteris henriettae</h1>
<p>Orthiopteris henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing clusters. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthiopteris henriettae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
