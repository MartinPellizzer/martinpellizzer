                    <h1>Orchis peramoena</h1>
<p>Orchis peramoena, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring dark green, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of violet to purple flowers. The flowers are characterized by their three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being narrower and more pointed. This species blooms from June to August, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its habitat is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
