                    <h1>Orobanche indica</h1>
<p>Orobanche indica, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host, typically members of the legume family. The plant is found in various regions of Asia and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on chemical signals from the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host crops.</p>
