                    <h1>Onobrychis viciifolia var. communis</h1>
<p>Onobrychis viciifolia var. communis, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. Sainfoin is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and hardiness make it a popular choice for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
