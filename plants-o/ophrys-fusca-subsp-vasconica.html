<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>vasconica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
