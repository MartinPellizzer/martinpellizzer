<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
