<p>Oncidium hians, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments with good air circulation.</p>
<p>Oncidium hians is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and vibrant floral display.</p>
