<p>Otostegia sinaitica, commonly known as Sinai stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a hardy, low-maintenance species.</p>
<p>Otostegia sinaitica is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental appeal.</p>
