<p>Oxalis ruizii, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, but with a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
