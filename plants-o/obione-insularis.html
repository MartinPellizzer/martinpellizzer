<p>Obione insularis, commonly known as the island obione, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbel-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near coastal areas or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Obione insularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
