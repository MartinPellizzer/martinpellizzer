                    <h1>Ophrys galilaea</h1>
<p>Ophrys galilaea, commonly known as the Galilean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to its pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys galilaea is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
