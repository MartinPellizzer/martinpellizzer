<p>Ononis excisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in the western United States.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to stabilize loose soils in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Ononis excisa is often found in desert scrub and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion.</p>
