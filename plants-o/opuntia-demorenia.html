                    <h1>Opuntia demorenia</h1>
<p>Opuntia demorenia, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia demorenia is also valued for its ability to provide food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
