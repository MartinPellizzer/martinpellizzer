                    <h1>Oxydectes echioidea</h1>
<p>Oxydectes echioidea, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often surrounded by a dense mass of leaf-like structures. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a highly endangered species.</p>
