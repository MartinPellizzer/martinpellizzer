                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. dicolorata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. dicolorata, commonly known as the colored rice or variegated rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its unique coloration in the grains.</p>
<p>The plant is a grass species native to Southeast Asia and is closely related to the common rice, Oryza sativa. Its grains exhibit a range of colors, including white, red, black, and brown, due to variations in pigment composition. This color variation is primarily due to differences in the accumulation of anthocyanins and other phytochemicals.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Oryza sativa var. dicolorata make it an interesting subject for both agricultural research and ornamental cultivation.</p>
