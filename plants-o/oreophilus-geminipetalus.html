                    <h1>Oreophilus geminipetalus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus geminipetalus, commonly known as the twin-petal orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that feature two prominent petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
