                    <h1>Osmunda cinnamomea var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Osmunda cinnamomea var. auriculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive cinnamon-colored fronds.</p>
<p>It features a tall, central fiddlehead that unfurls into a broad, bipinnate frond with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats.</p>
