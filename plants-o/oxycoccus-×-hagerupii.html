                    <h1>Oxycoccus × hagerupii</h1>
<p>Oxycoccus × hagerupii, commonly known as the Hagerup cranberry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Oxycoccus palustris and Oxycoccus microcarpus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe, particularly Norway and Sweden. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Its dense, compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The Hagerup cranberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions.</p>
