<p>Orobanche major f. krylowii, commonly known as the greater European broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
