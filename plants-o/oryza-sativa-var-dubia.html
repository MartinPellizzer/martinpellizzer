                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. dubia</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. dubia, commonly known as the doubtful rice, is a less commonly studied variant of the rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including smaller grains and a distinct coloration compared to standard rice varieties. This plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to specific climatic conditions. Its genetic makeup may hold potential for agricultural research due to its resilience traits.</p>
<p>However, it remains underutilized in modern agriculture due to limited cultivation and documentation.</p>
