                            <h1>Oxycoccus Palustris Subsp. Gigas</h1>
<p>Oxycoccus palustris subsp. gigas is a lesser-known but ecologically significant plant species found in wetland environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath or cowberry family. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark blue berries that persist through winter. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
