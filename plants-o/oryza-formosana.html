                    <h1>Oryza formosana</h1>
<p>Oryza formosana, commonly known as the Formosan rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded fields, where it thrives in shallow water. Its grains are smaller than those of cultivated rice species and have a distinct aroma.</p>
<p>Oryza formosana is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to aquatic environments.</p>
