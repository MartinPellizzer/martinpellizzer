                    <h1>Oxalis gregaria</h1>
<p>Oxalis gregaria, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems store moisture, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Oxalis gregaria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
