                    <h1>Osmia subtruncata</h1>
<p>Osmia subtruncata, commonly known as the narrow-tailed mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size, typically measuring around 8â€“10 millimeters in length, and its distinctive black body with metallic blue or green reflections. The female constructs mud nests in cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial nest boxes, to lay eggs. Osmia subtruncata plays an important role in pollination, particularly for fruit and nut trees.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves overwintering as a pupa, emerging in spring to forage and reproduce.</p>
