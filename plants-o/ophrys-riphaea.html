                    <h1>Ophrys riphaea</h1>
<p>Ophrys riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or brownish, are pollinated by male bees that are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>Ophrys riphaea is a rare and protected species, often found in high-altitude environments across the Alps and Carpathian regions.</p>
