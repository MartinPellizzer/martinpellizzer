                    <h1>Ophrys × viglaensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × viglaensis, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower morphology, with a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils with good drainage. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-like flowers that attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
