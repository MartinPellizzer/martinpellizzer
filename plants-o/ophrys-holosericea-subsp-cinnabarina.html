<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>cinnabarina, commonly known as the cinnabar orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange-brown flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
