                    <h1>Ophrys tarquinia</h1>
<p>Ophrys tarquinia, commonly known as the Tarquin's fly orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, mimicry-like flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-pollinated blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
