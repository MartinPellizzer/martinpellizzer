                    <h1>Orchis italica f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis italica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Italian orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the Italian orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white or cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its green foliage. This orchid is native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
