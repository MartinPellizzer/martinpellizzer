<p>Oreopanax membranaceus, commonly known as the membranous oreopanax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, adapting to moist, shaded environments in lowland and montane forests. Its foliage consists of palmately lobed leaves with a smooth, often glossy surface, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Oreopanax membranaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage structure.</p>
