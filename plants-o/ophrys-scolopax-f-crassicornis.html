<p>Ophrys scolopax f. crassicornis, commonly known as the broad-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are notable for their intricate petal shapes and vivid coloration, which play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and other environmental pressures, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
