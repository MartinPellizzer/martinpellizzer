                    <h1>Oreocarya macounii</h1>
<p>Oreocarya macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats.</p>
<p>Oreocarya macounii is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions.</p>
