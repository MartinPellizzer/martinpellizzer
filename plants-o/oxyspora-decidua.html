The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique seasonal behavior, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
