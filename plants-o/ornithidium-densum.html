<p>Ornithidium densum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high humidity and abundant sunlight. The plant features dense, compact fronds that are dark green and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes spread horizontally through the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Ornithidium densum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
