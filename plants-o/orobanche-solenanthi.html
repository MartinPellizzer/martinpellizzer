                    <h1>Orobanche solenanthi</h1>
<p>Orobanche solenanthi, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique ability to germinate in response to chemical signals released by its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as various Cactaceae and Fabaceae plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat preferences, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native environments.</p>
