                    <h1>Orthiopteris caudata</h1>
<p>Orthiopteris caudata, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in rocky, moist environments such as cliffs and stream banks, where it can anchor itself to vertical surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in woodland habitats.</p>
