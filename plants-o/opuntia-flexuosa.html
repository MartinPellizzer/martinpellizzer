<p>Opuntia flexuosa, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia flexuosa is also noted for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widespread species in its native range.</p>
