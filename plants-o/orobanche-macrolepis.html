                    <h1>Orobanche macrolepis</h1>
<p>Orobanche macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a parasite.</p>
