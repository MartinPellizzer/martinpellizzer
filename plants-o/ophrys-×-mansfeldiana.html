                    <h1>Ophrys × mansfeldiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mansfeldiana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers emit a scent reminiscent of bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower, thereby facilitating pollination.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in calcareous grasslands and is often associated with specific microhabitats that support its growth.</p>
