                    <h1>Oldenlandia arenarioides</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia arenarioides, commonly known as sand flatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in sandy soils, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Oldenlandia arenarioides is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
