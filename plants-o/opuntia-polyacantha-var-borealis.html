                    <h1>Opuntia polyacantha var. borealis</h1>
<p>Opuntia polyacantha var. borealis, commonly known as the northern prickly pear, is a cold-hardy cactus native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features flat, fleshy pads covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to survive in cooler climates compared to other Opuntia species.</p>
