<p>Oncoba angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oncoba, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the previous year's wood. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Oncoba angustipetala is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
