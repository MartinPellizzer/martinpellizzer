                    <h1>Ottelia alismoides f. lacustris</h1>
<p>Ottelia alismoides f. lacustris, commonly known as the water thyme, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Ottelia alismoides f. lacustris is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
