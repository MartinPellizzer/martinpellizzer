                    <h1>Ornduffia calthifolia</h1>
<p>Ornduffia calthifolia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
