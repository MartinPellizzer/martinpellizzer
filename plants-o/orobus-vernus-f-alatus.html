<p>Orobus vernus f. alatus, commonly known as the winged marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet "alatus.". This plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
