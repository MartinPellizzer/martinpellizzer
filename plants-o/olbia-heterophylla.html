<p>Olbia heterophylla, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Olbia heterophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
