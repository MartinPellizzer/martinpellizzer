                    <h1>Orobanche hypopitys</h1>
<p>Orobanche hypopitys, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, tubular stem with few leaves. It typically parasitizes plants in the Fabaceae family, such as legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
