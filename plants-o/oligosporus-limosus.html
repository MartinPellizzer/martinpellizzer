<p>Oligosporus limosus, commonly known as the slimy spore moss, is a type of aquatic moss found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like growth and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sporocarps. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in shaded areas with rich organic substrates. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-shaped, often covered in a gelatinous coating that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Oligosporus limosus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
