<p>Ophrys bilunulata subsp.</p>
<p>subfusca, commonly known as the dark-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually a dark brown or purplish color, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
