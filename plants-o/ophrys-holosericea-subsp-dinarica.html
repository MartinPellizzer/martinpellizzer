<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Dinaric Alps. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
