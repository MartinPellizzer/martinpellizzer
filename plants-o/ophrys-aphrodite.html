<p>Ophrys aphrodite, commonly known as the Venus's Flytrap, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are often pale green or brown, with a distinctive pattern that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys aphrodite is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
