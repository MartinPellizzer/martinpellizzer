                    <h1>Ononis nainii</h1>
<p>Ononis nainii, commonly known as the Armenian rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Ononis nainii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
