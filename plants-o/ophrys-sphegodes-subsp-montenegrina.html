<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and mountain meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
