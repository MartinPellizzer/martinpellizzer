                    <h1>Ormocarpum bibracteatum</h1>
<p>Ormocarpum bibracteatum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ormocarpum bibracteatum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
