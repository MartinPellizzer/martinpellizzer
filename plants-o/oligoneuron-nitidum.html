                    <h1>Oligoneuron nitidum</h1>
<p>Oligoneuron nitidum, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in a waxy, shiny cuticle. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in shaded areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
