                    <h1>Orchis morio f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis morio f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early purple orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the early purple orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple hue of the species. This orchid is native to parts of Europe and is often found in calcareous grasslands and woodland margins. Its botanical features include a tall, unbranched stem and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant blooms in late spring, producing showy, spurred flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
