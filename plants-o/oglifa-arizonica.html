<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky crevices and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in the region.</p>
