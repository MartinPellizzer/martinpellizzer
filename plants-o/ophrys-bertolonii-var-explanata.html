                    <h1>Ophrys bertolonii var. explanata</h1>
<p>Ophrys bertolonii var. explanata, commonly known as the Broad-leaf Bee Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet scent to attract male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
