                    <h1>Oxytropis nivea</h1>
<p>Oxytropis nivea, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxytropis nivea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
