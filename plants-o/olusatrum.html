                    <h1>Olusatrum</h1>
<p>Olusatrum, commonly known as the "blue-eyed grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often have a blue or violet hue, resembling those of the true grass family. Olusatrum species are typically found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and swamps, across the northern hemisphere. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The genus includes around 15 species, many of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
