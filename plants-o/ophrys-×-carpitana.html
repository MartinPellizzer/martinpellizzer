<p>Ophrys × carpitana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Ophrys genus in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology. The plant produces showy, pseudopapillae-covered flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in the study of plant evolution and mimicry.</p>
