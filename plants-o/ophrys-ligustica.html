<p>Ophrys ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys ligustica is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized structure designed to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
