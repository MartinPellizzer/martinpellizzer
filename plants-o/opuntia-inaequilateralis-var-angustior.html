                    <h1>Opuntia inaequilateralis var. angustior</h1>
<p>Opuntia inaequilateralis var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
