                    <h1>Odontochilus jaubertii</h1>
<p>Odontochilus jaubertii, commonly known as the Jaubert's toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive toothed lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
