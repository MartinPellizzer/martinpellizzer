                    <h1>Ophrys × joukoffiorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × joukoffiorum, commonly known as the Joukoff's bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, known for its intricate mimicry of female wasps.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent lip resembling a wasp's body. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean climates, particularly in southern Europe. The plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, pseudobulb-like structures.</p>
<p>Its pollination strategy relies on sexual deception, attracting male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower.</p>
