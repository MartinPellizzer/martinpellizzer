                    <h1>Oeosporangium hispanicum</h1>
<p>Oeosporangium hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, tree-like stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of cycads. Its sporangia are clustered in specialized structures called strobila, which are distinctive in their morphology.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oeosporangium hispanicum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
