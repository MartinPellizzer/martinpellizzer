                    <h1>Orobanche altissima</h1>
<p>Orobanche altissima, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
