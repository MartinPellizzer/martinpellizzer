                    <h1>Ophioglossum moluccanum f. dilatatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum moluccanum f. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and unique fern belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often asymmetrical leaves that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium clusters, which are typically located at the base of the leaf. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including the Moluccas, and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
