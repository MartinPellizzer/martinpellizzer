                    <h1>Onobrychis cristata</h1>
<p>Onobrychis cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
