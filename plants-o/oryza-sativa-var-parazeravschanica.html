                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. parazeravschanica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. parazeravschanica, commonly known as the Zeravshansky rice, is a rare and ancient variety of rice native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its short, compact grains and unique genetic makeup, which distinguishes it from other rice varieties. It typically grows in temperate climates and requires a shorter growing season compared to common rice types. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces panicles with small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it of interest for genetic research and crop diversity conservation.</p>
