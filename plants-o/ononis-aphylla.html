                    <h1>Ononis aphylla</h1>
<p>Ononis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, linear seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Ononis aphylla is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is an important part of the local flora in its native range.</p>
