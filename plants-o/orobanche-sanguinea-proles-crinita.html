                    <h1>Orobanche sanguinea proles crinita</h1>
<p>Orobanche sanguinea proles crinita, commonly known as the hairy common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as thistles and other members of the Asteraceae family. Its flowers are usually pale pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
