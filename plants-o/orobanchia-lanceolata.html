                    <h1>Orobanchia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Orobanchia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily grasses, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important study subject in parasitic plant ecology.</p>
