<p>Orchis orientalis subsp.</p>
<p>osmanica, commonly known as the Osman orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Turkey. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, hairy stem that bears a single, showy violet or purple flower.</p>
<p>The plant has a complex life cycle, often requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and growth. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days during late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in its natural range.</p>
