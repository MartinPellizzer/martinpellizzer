<p>Ornithopteris nipeensis, commonly known as the Nipe fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant diversity and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ornithopteris nipeensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures to preserve its existence.</p>
