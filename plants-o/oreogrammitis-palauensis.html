                    <h1>Oreogrammitis palauensis</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis palauensis, commonly known as the Palau fern, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis palauensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
