                    <h1>Orobanche curviflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche curviflora, commonly known as the curled-flower broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing on the roots of other plants such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some regions and can be difficult to control.</p>
