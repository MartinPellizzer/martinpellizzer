                    <h1>Opuntia parryi</h1>
<p>Opuntia parryi, commonly known as Parry's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia parryi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
