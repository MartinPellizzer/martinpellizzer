                    <h1>Orthoglottis</h1>
<p>Orthoglottis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. They are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. Orthoglottis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks.</p>
<p>The flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds, which play a crucial role in their reproductive cycle.</p>
