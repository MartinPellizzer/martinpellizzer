<p>Onobrychis gracilis var. longeaculeata, commonly known as slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, elongated pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
