                    <h1>Ornithopodium compressum</h1>
<p>Ornithopodium compressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Ornithopodium compressum is adapted to seasonal flooding and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
