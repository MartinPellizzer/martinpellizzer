<p>Orthocarpus castillejoides var. typicus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branching stem that often rises to heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
