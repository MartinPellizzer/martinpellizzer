                    <h1>Orobanche helianthemi</h1>
<p>Orobanche helianthemi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, as it attaches to the roots of its host plants. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like sunflowers and other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in cultivated environments.</p>
