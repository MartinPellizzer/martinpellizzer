<p>Oberonia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Oberonia cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
