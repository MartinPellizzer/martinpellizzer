<p>Orobanche corymbosa subsp.</p>
<p>mutabilis, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats.</p>
