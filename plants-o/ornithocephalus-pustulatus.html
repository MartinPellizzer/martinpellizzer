<p>Ornithocephalus pustulatus, commonly known as the blister orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and clustered, small greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its unique morphology includes pustular structures on the stems, which are thought to be adaptations for moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
