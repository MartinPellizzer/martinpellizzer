                    <h1>Orthophytum saxicola var. aloifolium</h1>
<p>Orthophytum saxicola var. aloifolium, commonly known as the rock cholla, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, spiny stems that store water. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
