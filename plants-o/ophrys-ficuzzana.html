<p>Ophrys ficuzzana, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys ficuzzana is a protected species in several European countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
