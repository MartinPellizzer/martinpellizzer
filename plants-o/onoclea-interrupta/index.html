                            <h1>Onoclea Interrupta</h1>
<p>Interrupted fern, scientifically known as Onoclea interrupta, is a delicate yet resilient member of the Dryopteridaceae family. Native to moist woodlands and stream banks across eastern North America, it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its distinctive fronds feature a unique pattern of interrupted segments, giving it its common name. This fern is often found in rich, loamy soils and plays a vital role in forest ecosystems. With its elegant appearance and ecological significance, the interrupted fern is both a botanical wonder and an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats.</p>
