<p>Oreogrammitis cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's wall-rush, is a rare fern that thrives in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is native to New Zealand and is found primarily in the South Island, particularly in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis cheesemanii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
