                    <h1>Oerstedella hansenii</h1>
<p>Oerstedella hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapellaceae and is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as on rock surfaces in arctic or alpine regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for monitoring ecosystem health.</p>
