<p>Ophrys × maremmae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>maremmae, commonly known as the Maremma orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, characterized by its intricate floral morphology. It exhibits a striking mimicry of female wasps, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy through sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in Italy. Its flowers are small, greenish-brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of wasps.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and its role in the study of hybridization in orchids.</p>
