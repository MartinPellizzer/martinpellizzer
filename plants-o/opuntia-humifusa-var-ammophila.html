                    <h1>Opuntia humifusa var. ammophila</h1>
<p>Opuntia humifusa var. ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena cactus, is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its fruit is a small, red, fleshy pear that contains numerous seeds. It is adapted to sandy and coastal environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant's succulent structure enables it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid conditions.</p>
