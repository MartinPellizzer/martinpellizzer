                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. pilosa, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to East Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender grains that are typically brown or black in color. The plant grows in wetland environments and has a tall, branched stem with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often cultivated for their nutritional value and are used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from cultivated rice due to its wild origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
