                    <h1>Orchis palustris var. mediterranea</h1>
<p>Orchis palustris var. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is considered a relict species, reflecting its historical distribution and ecological adaptations.</p>
