                    <h1>Orobanche bracteosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, and it can persist in the soil for several years as a seed bank.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant harm to agricultural crops.</p>
