                    <h1>Oberonia anthropophora var. arisanensis</h1>
<p>Oberonia anthropophora var. arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often obscured by the foliage, making it difficult to spot. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically in primary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
