                    <h1>Orchis mascula f. platyloba</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula f. platyloba, commonly known as the flat-lipped male orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the male orchid.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a broad, flat lip that distinguishes it from other orchid forms. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
