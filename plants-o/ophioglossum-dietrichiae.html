                    <h1>Ophioglossum dietrichiae</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum dietrichiae, commonly known as the dwarf adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a short, stout rhizome and a single, pinnately compound leaf. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
