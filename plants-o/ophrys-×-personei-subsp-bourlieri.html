<p>Ophrys × personei subsp.</p>
<p>bourlieri, commonly known as the Bourlier's bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces strikingly detailed floral structures that resemble female bees, a trait evolved to enhance pollination through sexual deception. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
