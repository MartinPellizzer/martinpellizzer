                    <h1>Ophioglossum ammophilum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum ammophilum, commonly known as the sand scorpion plant, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, scorpion-like shape on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in temperate regions. It has a short lifespan, with some species completing their life cycle in a single growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophioglossum ammophilum is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
