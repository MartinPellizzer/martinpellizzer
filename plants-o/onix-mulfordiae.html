                    <h1>Onix mulfordiae</h1>
<p>Onix mulfordiae, commonly known as the mulford's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that display a striking combination of pale green and silvery-white hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Onix mulfordiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
