                    <h1>Ophrys demangei</h1>
<p>Ophrys demangei, commonly known as the Demange's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive pattern that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys demangei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
