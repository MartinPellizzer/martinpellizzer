                    <h1>Oldfieldia dactylophylla</h1>
<p>Oldfieldia dactylophylla, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the salt marshes of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, where it uses its specialized leaves to filter nutrients from the surrounding water. Its root system is adapted to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, allowing it to survive in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
