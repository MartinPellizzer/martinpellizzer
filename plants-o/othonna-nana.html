<p>Othonna nana, commonly known as the dwarf othonna, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Othonna nana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
