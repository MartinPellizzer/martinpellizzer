                    <h1>Ononis breviflora</h1>
<p>Ononis breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Ononis breviflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
