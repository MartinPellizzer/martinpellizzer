                    <h1>Orobanche ludoviciana var. multiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche ludoviciana var. multiflora, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble paintbrushes, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
