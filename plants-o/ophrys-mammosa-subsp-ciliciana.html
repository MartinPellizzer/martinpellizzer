<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>ciliciana, commonly known as the Cilician bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its flowers are pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
