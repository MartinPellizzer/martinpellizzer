<p>Ophrys bornmuelleri subsp.</p>
<p>bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
