<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>climacis, commonly known as the mountain bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specific pollination mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas of Europe. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
