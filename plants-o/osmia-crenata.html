                    <h1>Osmia crenata</h1>
<p>Osmia crenata, commonly known as the serrated orchard mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive serrated abdominal segments. The plant it pollinates, such as fruit trees and wildflowers, benefits from its efficient pollination behavior. Osmia crenata constructs its nest in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities, often using plant-derived materials.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal blooming of its preferred flora, making it an important pollinator in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
