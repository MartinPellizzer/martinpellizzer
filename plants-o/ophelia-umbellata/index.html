                            <h1>Ophelia Umbellata</h1>
<p>Water crowfoot, scientifically known as Ophelia umbellata, is a delicate aquatic plant commonly found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a distinctive umbellate appearance. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often inhabiting ponds, lakes, and stream margins. Its feathery leaves and elegant blossoms make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens. Despite its beauty, Ophelia umbellata plays an important ecological role by supporting aquatic life and improving water quality.</p>
