                    <h1>Opuntia glauca</h1>
<p>Opuntia glauca, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, blue-green stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia glauca is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
