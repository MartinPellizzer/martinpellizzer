                    <h1>Ophrys × caballeroi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × caballeroi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with petals that mimic the appearance of insects, particularly bees and wasps, to attract specific pollinators. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles an insect's body.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys × caballeroi is considered a protected species in several regions.</p>
