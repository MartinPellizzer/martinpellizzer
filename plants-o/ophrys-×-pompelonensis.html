                    <h1>Ophrys × pompelonensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pompelonensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate and deceptive floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown with intricate patterns, and it thrives in calcareous soils in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of particular interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts due to its evolutionary significance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
