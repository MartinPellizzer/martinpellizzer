                    <h1>Oberonia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Oberonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with thin, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycoheterotrophic, meaning they rely on fungal associations for nutrients.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for ecological and mycological studies.</p>
