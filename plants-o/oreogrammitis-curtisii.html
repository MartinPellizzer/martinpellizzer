                    <h1>Oreogrammitis curtisii</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis curtisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens.</p>
