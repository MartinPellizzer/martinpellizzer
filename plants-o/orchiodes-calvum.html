                    <h1>Orchiodes calvum</h1>
<p>Orchiodes calvum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy stems and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant prefers high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature adapted to its humid, montane habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Orchiodes calvum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
