<p>Orchis pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>laeta, commonly known as the joy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It features a slender, hairy stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are often clustered in a loose spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
