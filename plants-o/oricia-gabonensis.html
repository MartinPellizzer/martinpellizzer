<p>Oricia gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oricia gabonensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
