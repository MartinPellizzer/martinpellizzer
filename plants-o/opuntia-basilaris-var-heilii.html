                    <h1>Opuntia basilaris var. heilii</h1>
<p>Opuntia basilaris var. heilii, commonly known as the Heil's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and small glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
