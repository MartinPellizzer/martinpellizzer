<p>Oberonia fissiglossa, commonly known as the slit-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Oberonia fissiglossa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or among leaf litter.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
