<p>Oxygonum robustum, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the water's edge, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Oxygonum robustum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
