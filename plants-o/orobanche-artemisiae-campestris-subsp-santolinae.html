<p>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp.</p>
<p>santolinae, commonly known as the Santolina broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in Mediterranean regions and thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, particularly those in the Asteraceae family.</p>
