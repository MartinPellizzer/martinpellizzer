<p>Ononis reclinata var. simplex, commonly known as the simple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and coastal dunes.</p>
