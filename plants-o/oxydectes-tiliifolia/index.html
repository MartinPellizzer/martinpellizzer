                            <h1>Oxydectes Tiliifolia</h1>
<p>Tiliifoliate oxeye, scientifically known as Oxydectes tiliifolia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters, making it a visually captivating species. It thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies and in swampy areas, where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, adding to its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. Despite its beauty, the Tiliifoliate oxeye remains relatively obscure, with limited research dedicated to its biology and conservation status.</p>
