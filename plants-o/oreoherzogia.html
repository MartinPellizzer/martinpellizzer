                    <h1>Oreoherzogia</h1>
<p>Oreoherzogia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of Southwestern North America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Oreoherzogia species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The genus is named in honor of the botanist Hermann Herzog, reflecting its significance in botanical research.</p>
