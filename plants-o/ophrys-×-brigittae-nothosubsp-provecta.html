<p>Ophrys × brigittae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>provecta, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, showcasing traits from both parent species.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its intricate floral morphology, particularly its labellum, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellowish-brown with intricate patterns, and it thrives in calcareous soils in open habitats.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its rarity and the complexity of its hybrid origin.</p>
