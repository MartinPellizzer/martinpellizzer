<p>Oxalis corniculata subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the running wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
