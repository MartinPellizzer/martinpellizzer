                    <h1>Ononis repens var. subspinosa</h1>
<p>Ononis repens var. subspinosa, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant in erosion control.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly prickly stems, which give it the subspecies name subspinosa.</p>
