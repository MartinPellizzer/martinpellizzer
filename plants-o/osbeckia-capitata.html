<p>Osbeckia capitata, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Osbeckia capitata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
