                    <h1>Opuntia spiniflora</h1>
<p>Opuntia spiniflora, commonly known as the hooked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia spiniflora is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>
