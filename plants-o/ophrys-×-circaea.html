                    <h1>Ophrys × circaea</h1>
<p>Ophrys × circaea, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that have evolved to mimic female bees, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. Ophrys × circaea typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical features, including its specialized floral morphology and reproductive biology, make it a subject of interest in both ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
