<p>Opuntia zamudioi, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia zamudioi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
