                    <h1>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. opacum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. opacum, commonly known as the opacum adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It possesses a short, underground rhizome with a single, erect, leafy shoot that forms a distinctive, sword-shaped blade. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, often in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
