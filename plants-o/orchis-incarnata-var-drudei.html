                    <h1>Orchis incarnata var. drudei</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata var. drudei, commonly known as the Drude's pink twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features a slender stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
