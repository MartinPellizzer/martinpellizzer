                    <h1>Orobanche lucorum var. rubi</h1>
<p>Orobanche lucorum var. rubi, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is dependent on the presence of specific host plants, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
