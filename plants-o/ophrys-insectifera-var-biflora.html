                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera var. biflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera var. biflora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive bee-like pouch.</p>
<p>This orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in calcareous soils.</p>
