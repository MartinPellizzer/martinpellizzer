<p>Ophiorrhiza, commonly known as the "beach morning glory," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small shrubs or herbs, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. They are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, often pale or white flowers. Ophiorrhiza species are adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making them important components of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in their dispersal in moist environments.</p>
