                    <h1>Oxytropis nigrescens var. arctobia</h1>
<p>Oxytropis nigrescens var. arctobia, commonly known as the Alaska locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a toxic plant to livestock, particularly in large quantities.</p>
