                    <h1>Ophrys × sancti-cataldi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sancti-cataldi, commonly known as the Saint-Cataldine orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys citrina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct, elongated spur.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sancti-cataldi is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination systems.</p>
