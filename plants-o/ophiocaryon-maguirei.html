                    <h1>Ophiocaryon maguirei</h1>
<p>Ophiocaryon maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Ophiocaryon maguirei plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
