The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
