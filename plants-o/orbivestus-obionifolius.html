                    <h1>Orbivestus obionifolius</h1>
<p>Orbivestus obionifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soil and access deep groundwater.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
