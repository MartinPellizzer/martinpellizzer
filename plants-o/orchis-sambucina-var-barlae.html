                    <h1>Orchis sambucina var. barlae</h1>
<p>Orchis sambucina var. barlae, commonly known as the Barlae orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Native to specific regions of Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle, with a long period of dormancy followed by a brief flowering season.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
