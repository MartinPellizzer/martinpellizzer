                    <h1>Oryzopsis tibetica</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis tibetica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects.</p>
