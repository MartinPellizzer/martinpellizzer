                    <h1>Orobanche condensata</h1>
<p>Orobanche condensata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on species of Astragalus and other legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with few leaves. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many areas where it invades cultivated fields.</p>
