                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. cornubiensis</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish spotted orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the South West of England.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white spotted flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish tinge, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variety is under threat and is protected in several conservation sites.</p>
