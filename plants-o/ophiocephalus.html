<p>Ophiocephalus, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Ophiocephalus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
