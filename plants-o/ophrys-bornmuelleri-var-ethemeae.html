                    <h1>Ophrys bornmuelleri var. ethemeae</h1>
<p>Ophrys bornmuelleri var. ethemeae, commonly known as the Ethemea bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
