                    <h1>Ophioglossum nipponicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and has a distinctive, primitive morphology. Its sporangia are clustered in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fertile leaf.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
