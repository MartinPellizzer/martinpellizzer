                    <h1>Orobanche caucasica</h1>
<p>Orobanche caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to obtain nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
