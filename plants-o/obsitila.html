                    <h1>Obsitila</h1>
<p>Obsitila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant has a single, slender stem with a few leaves and produces flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rarity and ecological specificity make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, obsitila is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
