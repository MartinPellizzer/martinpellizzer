                    <h1>Oporinia keretina</h1>
<p>Oporinia keretina, commonly known as the keretina fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Otogoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Oporinia keretina plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
