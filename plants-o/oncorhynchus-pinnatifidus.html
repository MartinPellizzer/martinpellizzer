                    <h1>Oncorhynchus pinnatifidus</h1>
<p>Oncorhynchus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the Pinnatifid salmon, is a species of salmon native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its streamlined body and silvery scales, which help it navigate through fast-flowing streams and rivers. The plant's botanical features include its elongated leaves and specialized reproductive structures adapted for aquatic environments. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Oncorhynchus pinnatifidus is a fish species, not a plant, and therefore does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
