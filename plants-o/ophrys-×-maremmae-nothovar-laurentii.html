                    <h1>Ophrys × maremmae nothovar. laurentii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × maremmae nothovar. laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces a single flowering stem.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying mimicry and hybridization in orchids.</p>
