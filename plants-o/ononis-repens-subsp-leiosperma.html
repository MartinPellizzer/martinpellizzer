<p>Ononis repens subsp.</p>
<p>leiosperma, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It features small, clustered stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in loose clusters, blooming from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a characteristic component of desert and coastal environments.</p>
