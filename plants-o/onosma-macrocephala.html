<p>Onosma macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Onosma macrocephala is known for its resilience to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
