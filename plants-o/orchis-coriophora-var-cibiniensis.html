                    <h1>Orchis coriophora var. cibiniensis</h1>
<p>Orchis coriophora var. cibiniensis, commonly known as the Cibinian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its morphology is adapted to its specific ecological niche, with specialized root structures that aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
