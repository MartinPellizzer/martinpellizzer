                    <h1>Ophioglossum hitkishorei</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum hitkishorei, commonly known as the Kishore's adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, characterized by its unique, primitive morphology and spore-producing structures. The plant features a short, erect rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped sterile leaf and a separate, smaller fertile leaf that bears spores on its underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
