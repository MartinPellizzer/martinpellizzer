                    <h1>Orbignya speciosa</h1>
<p>Orbignya speciosa, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, feather-like leaves and produces large, clustered fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The fruit contains a hard-shelled seed surrounded by a fatty, edible kernel. The plant is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role and has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for its oil-rich seeds.</p>
