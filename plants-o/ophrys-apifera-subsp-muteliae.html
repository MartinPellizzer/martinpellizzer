<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>muteliae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that closely resembles a bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in Mediterranean climate conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and it is known for its limited distribution and conservation status.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, this subspecies is considered vulnerable.</p>
