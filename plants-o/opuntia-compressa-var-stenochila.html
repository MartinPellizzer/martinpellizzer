                    <h1>Opuntia compressa var. stenochila</h1>
<p>Opuntia compressa var. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically narrower than those of other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are covered in glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs that can cause irritation.</p>
<p>Opuntia compressa var. stenochila is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
