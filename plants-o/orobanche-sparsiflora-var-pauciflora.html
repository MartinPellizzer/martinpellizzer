                    <h1>Orobanche sparsiflora var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche sparsiflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The species typically produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers in clusters, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
