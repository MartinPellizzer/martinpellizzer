                    <h1>Ophrys × gabrielis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × gabrielis, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a vivid yellow and brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Ophrys × gabrielis is often found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
