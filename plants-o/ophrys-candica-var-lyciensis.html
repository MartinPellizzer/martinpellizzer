                    <h1>Ophrys candica var. lyciensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys candica var. lyciensis, commonly known as the Lycian bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
