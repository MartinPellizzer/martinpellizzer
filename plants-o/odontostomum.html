<p>Odontostomum, commonly known as the "spear-mouth" liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is flat and leaf-like, and lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which produce sperm and eggs respectively.</p>
<p>Odontostomum plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
