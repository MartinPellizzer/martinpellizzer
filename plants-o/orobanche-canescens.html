                    <h1>Orobanche canescens</h1>
<p>Orobanche canescens, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialized parasite.</p>
