<p>Ornithidium condorense, commonly known as the Condor Valley orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
