                    <h1>Orobus setifolius var. amphicarpus</h1>
<p>Orobus setifolius var. amphicarpus, commonly known as the hairy leaf orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its unique ability to produce two types of fruits—some above ground and some underground—makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>This variation in fruiting strategy may contribute to its ecological success in disturbed soils.</p>
