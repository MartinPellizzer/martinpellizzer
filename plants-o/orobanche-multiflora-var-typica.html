                    <h1>Orobanche multiflora var. typica</h1>
<p>Orobanche multiflora var. typica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system that attaches to the roots of host plants. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops and native plant communities.</p>
