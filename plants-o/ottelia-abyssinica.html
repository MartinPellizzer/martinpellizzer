                    <h1>Ottelia abyssinica</h1>
<p>Ottelia abyssinica, commonly known as the African water plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that float on the water surface, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ottelia abyssinica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
