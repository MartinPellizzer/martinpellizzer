                    <h1>Ornithocephalochloa arenicola</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalochloa arenicola, commonly known as the sand-dwelling grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of many grasses. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
