                    <h1>Obregonia</h1>
<p>Obregonia, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The leaves are typically reduced to spines, and the flowers, which are often yellow or orange, appear at the base of the stems during the warmer months. Obregonia species are succulents, meaning they have adapted to survive with minimal water by storing it in their thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>They are popular in xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
