<p>Opuntia mesacantha var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in spiny areoles and often have a green or blue-green coloration. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, edible fruits. Its adaptations include reduced leaves and thick stems that store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both ornamental purposes and its potential medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
