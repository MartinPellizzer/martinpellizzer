                    <h1>Oberonia balakrishnanii</h1>
<p>Oberonia balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan’s orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, slender rhizome and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct red or purple lip. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its leaves are linear and革质 (leathery), adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle by efficiently absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
