                    <h1>Ottelia cordata</h1>
<p>Ottelia cordata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Ottelia cordata plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
