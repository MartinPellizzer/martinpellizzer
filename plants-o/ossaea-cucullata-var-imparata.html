                    <h1>Ossaea cucullata var. imparata</h1>
<p>Ossaea cucullata var. imparata, commonly known as the flat-leaf lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically flattened and leaf-like in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree trunks and rocky surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its ecological contribution to forest ecosystems.</p>
