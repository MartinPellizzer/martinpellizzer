<p>Orianthera wendyae, commonly known as Wendy's orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy blooms that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant features a slender, erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are known for their intricate, lip-like structure that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orianthera wendyae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
