                    <h1>Orithyia uniflora</h1>
<p>Orithyia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Its flowers typically exhibit a combination of white and purple hues, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Orithyia uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
