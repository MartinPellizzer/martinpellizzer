<p>Oligactis boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Quercus and Erythroxylum. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Oligactis boyacensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat by influencing host tree health and providing resources for certain insect species.</p>
