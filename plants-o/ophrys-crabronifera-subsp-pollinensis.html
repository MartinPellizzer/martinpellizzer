<p>Ophrys crabronifera subsp.</p>
<p>pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollinensis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a vivid yellow and brown patterned lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, which is highly adapted for mimicry to attract male bees for pollination. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other Ophrys species and is noted for its ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
