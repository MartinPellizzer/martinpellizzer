                    <h1>Ornithocephalus cryptanthus</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus cryptanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in winter, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with dense, silver-green foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh conditions. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday, a trait that may aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Ornithocephalus cryptanthus is also notable for its ability to survive in extreme drought, making it a resilient and fascinating example of botanical adaptation.</p>
