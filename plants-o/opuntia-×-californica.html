                    <h1>Opuntia × californica</h1>
<p>Opuntia × californica, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
