                    <h1>Ononis sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Ononis sessilifolia, commonly known as small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
