<p>Oreanthes hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground orchid, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its flowers developing underground and only emerging through a narrow stalk. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oreanthes hypogaeus is considered a protected species in many areas.</p>
