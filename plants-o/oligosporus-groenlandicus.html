                    <h1>Oligosporus groenlandicus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus groenlandicus, commonly known as the Greenland sporegrass, is a unique plant species native to the Arctic regions of Greenland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, with small, needle-like leaves adapted to withstand harsh cold climates. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed spores rather than flowers, which is a key feature of its reproductive strategy. Its growth is limited to nutrient-poor, rocky soils, making it a resilient species in extreme environments.</p>
<p>Oligosporus groenlandicus plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the Arctic tundra ecosystem.</p>
