                    <h1>Ophioglossum nudicaule f. minus</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum nudicaule f. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, narrow, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
