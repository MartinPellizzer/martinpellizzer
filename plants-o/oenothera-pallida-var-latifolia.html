                    <h1>Oenothera pallida var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Oenothera pallida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds.</p>
