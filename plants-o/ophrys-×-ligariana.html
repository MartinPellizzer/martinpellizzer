                    <h1>Ophrys × ligariana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × ligariana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys lutea (the yellow bee orchid), resulting in a plant with unique floral characteristics. The flower resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with intricate patterns and a distinct lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in temperate regions of Europe.</p>
