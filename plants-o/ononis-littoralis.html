<p>Ononis littoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in salty, sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its showy blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Ononis littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
