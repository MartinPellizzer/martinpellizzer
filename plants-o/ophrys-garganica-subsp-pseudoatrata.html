<p>Ophrys garganica subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoatrata, commonly known as the Garganica orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
