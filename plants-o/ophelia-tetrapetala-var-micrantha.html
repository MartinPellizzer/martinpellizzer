                    <h1>Ophelia tetrapetala var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Ophelia tetrapetala var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the bottom of water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
