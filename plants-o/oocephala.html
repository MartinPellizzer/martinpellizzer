                    <h1>Oocephala</h1>
<p>Oocephala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to glow under certain light conditions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the wet season, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, misty environment it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and delicate nature, Oocephala is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected reserves.</p>
