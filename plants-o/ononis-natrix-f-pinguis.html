                    <h1>Ononis natrix f. pinguis</h1>
<p>Ononis natrix f. pinguis, commonly known as the fatstem sandwort, is a variant of the sandwort species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
