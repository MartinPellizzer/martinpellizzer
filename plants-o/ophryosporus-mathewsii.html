                    <h1>Ophryosporus mathewsii</h1>
<p>Ophryosporus mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' ghost flower, is a unique member of the family Apiaceae, characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance that gives it its common name. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only after rainfall in dry seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophryosporus mathewsii is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
