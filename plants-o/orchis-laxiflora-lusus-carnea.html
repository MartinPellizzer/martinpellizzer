                    <h1>Orchis laxiflora lusus carnea</h1>
<p>Orchis laxiflora lusus carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and meadows, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of many orchid species, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in several regions.</p>
