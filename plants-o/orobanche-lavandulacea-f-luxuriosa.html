The plant is characterized by its dense, branched stems and clusters of small, purple or violet flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a nuisance in agricultural settings but also serves as a host for certain insects and fungi.</p>
