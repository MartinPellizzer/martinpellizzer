<p>Oboskon cretica, commonly known as the desert candle.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant native to arid regions, characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that resemble candles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Oboskon cretica is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
