                    <h1>Orobanchia</h1>
<p>Orobanchia, commonly known as the broomrape, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they partially parasitize other plants by penetrating their roots to extract water and nutrients. Orobanchia species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in agricultural fields. They lack chlorophyll and are therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on their host plants for sustenance.</p>
<p>Some species are considered weeds due to their ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
