                    <h1>Orobus tuberosus var. unijugus</h1>
<p>Orobus tuberosus var. unijugus, commonly known as the single-jugled tuberous orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
