                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera var. luteomarginata</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera var. luteomarginata, commonly known as the yellow-margin bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are predominantly brown with distinctive yellow margins, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
