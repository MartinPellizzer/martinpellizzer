                    <h1>Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. mavromata</h1>
<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. mavromata, commonly known as the black-veined bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are predominantly dark brown or black, with intricate veining that enhances its visual resemblance to insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
