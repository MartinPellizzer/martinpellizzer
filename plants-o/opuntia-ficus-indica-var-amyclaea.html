<p>Opuntia ficus-indica var. amyclaea, commonly known as the Canary Island prickly pear, is a variety of the opuntia cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and forage.</p>
