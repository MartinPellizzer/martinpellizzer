                    <h1>Opuntia × occidentalis var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Opuntia × occidentalis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
