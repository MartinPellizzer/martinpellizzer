<p>Opuntia engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>rastrera, commonly known as the Englemann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
