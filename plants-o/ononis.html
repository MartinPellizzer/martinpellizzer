                    <h1>Ononis</h1>
<p>Ononis, commonly known as whitlow grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They produce small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Ononis species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties, particularly for skin conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
