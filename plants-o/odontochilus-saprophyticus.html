                    <h1>Odontochilus saprophyticus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus saprophyticus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic plant, meaning it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a specialized structure called a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and often have a faintly fragrant scent, which helps attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
