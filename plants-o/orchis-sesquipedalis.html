                    <h1>Orchis sesquipedalis</h1>
<p>Orchis sesquipedalis, commonly known as the long-root orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid's root system is extensive, contributing to its common name and playing a role in its ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
