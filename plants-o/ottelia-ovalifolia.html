                    <h1>Ottelia ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Ottelia ovalifolia, commonly known as water lentil or floating heart, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Ottelia ovalifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to thrive in aquatic environments while contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
