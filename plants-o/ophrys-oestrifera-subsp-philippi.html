<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>philippi, commonly known as the Philippi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key feature in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like shape and coloration, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
