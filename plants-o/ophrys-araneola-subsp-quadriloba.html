<p>Ophrys araneola subsp.</p>
<p>quadriloba, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flower structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy orchid flower with a complex morphology that resembles a spider, aiding in attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
