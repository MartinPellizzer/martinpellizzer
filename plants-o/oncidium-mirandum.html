                    <h1>Oncidium mirandum</h1>
<p>Oncidium mirandum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Month, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features long, drooping inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in various colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium mirandum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
