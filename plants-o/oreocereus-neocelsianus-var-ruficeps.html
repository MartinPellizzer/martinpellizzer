                    <h1>Oreocereus neocelsianus var. ruficeps</h1>
<p>Oreocereus neocelsianus var. ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach several meters in height, adorned with dense clusters of bright red, woolly spines. The flowers, which appear at the top of the stem, are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive reddish hue at the base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike.</p>
