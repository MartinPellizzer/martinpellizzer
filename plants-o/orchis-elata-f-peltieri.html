<p>Orchis elata f. peltieri, commonly known as the Peltate Orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. This orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
