<p>Odontites jaubertianus subsp.</p>
<p>siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
