<p>Otholobium trianthum, commonly known as the three-flowered bushveld clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Otholobium trianthum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
