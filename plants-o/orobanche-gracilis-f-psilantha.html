                    <h1>Orobanche gracilis f. psilantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche gracilis f. psilantha, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats where it can parasitize a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its reduced leaves and specialized haustoria allow it to efficiently extract water and nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions.</p>
