<p>Orobanche foetida subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, often pale or yellowish flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
