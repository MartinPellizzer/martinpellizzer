<p>Opuntia robusta, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia robusta is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its stems can store water, making it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
