<p>Oritrophium limnophilum subsp.</p>
<p>mutisianum, commonly known as the water-loving coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue ray flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>The subspecies mutisianum is distinguished by its slightly different flower morphology compared to the main species.</p>
