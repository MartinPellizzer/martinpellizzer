<p>Oocephalus pauciflorus, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of certain regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oocephalus pauciflorus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
