                    <h1>Orchis × decipiens</h1>
<p>Orchis × decipiens, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly similar appearance to the bee orchid, Orchis morio, which leads to its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a bee, aiding in pollination. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>Orchis × decipiens is a short-lived perennial, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
