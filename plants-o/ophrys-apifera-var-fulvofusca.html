<p>Ophrys apifera var. fulvofusca, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure that closely resembles a bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This orchid is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized roots.</p>
