<p>Opercularia lamarckiana, commonly known as the lace lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, web-like thallus that is often covered in a delicate, lace-like pattern of lobes and pores. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capability, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in forest ecosystems.</p>
