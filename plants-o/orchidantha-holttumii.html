                    <h1>Orchidantha holttumii</h1>
<p>Orchidantha holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchidantha holttumii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
