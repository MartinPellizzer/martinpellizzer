                    <h1>Orobanche pallida</h1>
<p>Orobanche pallida, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and legumes, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on its host, making it a challenging species to study in the wild.</p>
<p>Orobanche pallida is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
