<p>Orobanche cooperi subsp.</p>
<p>palmeri, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and establishing a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems.</p>
