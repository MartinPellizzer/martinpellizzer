                    <h1>Orobanche coerulescens f. pekinensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche coerulescens f. pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. This variety is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is often found growing on the roots of various host species such as legumes and grasses. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the host for water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to persist in disturbed soils and its potential role in ecological studies of parasitic flora.</p>
