                    <h1>Orobanche lycoctoni</h1>
<p>Orobanche lycoctoni, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize host species. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays an important role in ecological interactions and can be a challenge for farmers.</p>
