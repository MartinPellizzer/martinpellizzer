                    <h1>Ophrys × cesinensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × cesinensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as Italy and Spain. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees or wasps, a feature known as sexual deception. This mimicry is used to attract male pollinators, which in turn transfer pollen between flowers.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Ophrys × cesinensis include its tall, erect stems and its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
