                    <h1>Oeceoclades spathulifera</h1>
<p>Oeceoclades spathulifera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
