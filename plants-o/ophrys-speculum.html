                    <h1>Ophrys speculum</h1>
<p>Ophrys speculum, commonly known as the mirror orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like appearance, with a flower that mimics the face of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and has a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The orchid's specialized morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
