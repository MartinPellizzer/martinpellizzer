<p>Opuntia elata subsp.</p>
<p>rioplatensis, commonly known as the Rio Platense prickly pear, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses.</p>
