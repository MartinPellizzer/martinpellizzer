                    <h1>Oreogrammitis setigera</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis setigera, commonly known as the forked chain fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
