                    <h1>Octella umbrosa</h1>
<p>Octella umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a delicate and shade-tolerant plant native to the moist, forested regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that create a lush, green appearance. The plant typically grows along the forest floor, where it thrives in high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
