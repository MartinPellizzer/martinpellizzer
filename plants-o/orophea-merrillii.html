<p>Orophea merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan star tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, palm-like appearance with smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits. Orophea merrillii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly found in commercial horticulture due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
