                    <h1>Orobanche carotae</h1>
<p>Orobanche carotae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the sunflower family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host for survival and reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops like carrots and sunflowers.</p>
