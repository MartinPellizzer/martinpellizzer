<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>chlorantha, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a flower that closely resembles a bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
