                    <h1>Ophrys × kolymbiae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × kolymbiae, commonly known as the Kolymbia bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys citrina.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Greece and is characterized by its unique floral morphology that mimics the appearance of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates with adequate moisture. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, and it blooms from late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys × kolymbiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
