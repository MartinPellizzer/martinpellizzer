                    <h1>Oryzopsis microcarpa var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis microcarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dwarf bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and ability to provide texture in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
