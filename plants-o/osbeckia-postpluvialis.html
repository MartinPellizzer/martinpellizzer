<p>Osbeckia postpluvialis, commonly known as the coastal osbeckia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Osbeckia postpluvialis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
