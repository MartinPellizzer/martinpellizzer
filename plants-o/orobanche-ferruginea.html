                    <h1>Orobanche ferruginea</h1>
<p>Orobanche ferruginea, commonly known as the redstem broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is often found growing on the roots of various plants in the Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. Its life cycle is dependent on the presence of suitable host plants, which provide the necessary nutrients for its growth and development.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
