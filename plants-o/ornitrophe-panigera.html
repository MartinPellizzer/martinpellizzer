                    <h1>Ornitrophe panigera</h1>
<p>Ornitrophe panigera, commonly known as the skyward bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals that resemble small bells, and its slender, upright stems. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornitrophe panigera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
