                    <h1>Orobanche gracilis var. citrina</h1>
<p>Orobanche gracilis var. citrina, commonly known as yellow dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses, in temperate regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
