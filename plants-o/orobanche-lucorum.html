                    <h1>Orobanche lucorum</h1>
<p>Orobanche lucorum, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, often growing on the roots of legumes such as vetch and clover.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
