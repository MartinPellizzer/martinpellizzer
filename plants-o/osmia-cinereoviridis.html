                    <h1>Osmia cinereoviridis</h1>
<p>Osmia cinereoviridis, commonly known as the ash-gray mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive ash-gray body with a metallic greenish sheen, which helps in its identification. This bee is a pollen specialist, primarily visiting early-flowering plants such as willows and fruit trees. Osmia cinereoviridis constructs its nests in pre-existing cavities, often in hollow stems or wood, where it lays eggs provisioned with pollen.</p>
<p>Its role as a pollinator is significant, especially for plants that bloom early in the spring.</p>
