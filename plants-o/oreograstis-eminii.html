<p>Oreograstis eminii, commonly known as the highland bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreograstis eminii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
