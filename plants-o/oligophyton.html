                    <h1>Oligophyton</h1>
<p>Oligophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria for nutrition.</p>
<p>Oligophyton is an important indicator species for environmental conditions, particularly in areas with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
