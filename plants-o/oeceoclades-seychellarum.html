<p>Oeceoclades seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Seychelles archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a slender pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces small, colorful blossoms that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
