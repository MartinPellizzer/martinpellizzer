                    <h1>Oreotelia</h1>
<p>Oreotelia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly the Andes region, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Oreotelia species are adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and often grow in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them important components of alpine ecosystems.</p>
