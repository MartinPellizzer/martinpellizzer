                    <h1>Ophrys × joannae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × joannae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>This orchid is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation and hybridization in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
