                    <h1>Othonna virginea</h1>
<p>Othonna virginea, commonly known as the silver leaf othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a decorative ornamental plant.</p>
