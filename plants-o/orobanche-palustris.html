                    <h1>Orobanche palustris</h1>
<p>Orobanche palustris, commonly known as the marsh broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily grasses, to extract nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is often found in wet or damp habitats such as marshes and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
