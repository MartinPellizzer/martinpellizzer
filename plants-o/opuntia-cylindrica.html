<p>Opuntia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia cylindrica is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
