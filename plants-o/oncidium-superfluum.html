                    <h1>Oncidium superfluum</h1>
<p>Oncidium superfluum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
