                    <h1>Orobanche polychroma</h1>
<p>Orobanche polychroma, commonly known as the purple witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that are often mistaken for those of its host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
