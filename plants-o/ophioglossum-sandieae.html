                    <h1>Ophioglossum sandieae</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum sandieae, commonly known as the Sandie's adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Ophioglossales, which is one of the most primitive groups of ferns, characterized by its unique reproductive structures. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, elongated, and often divided leaf that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of the leaf.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum sandieae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
