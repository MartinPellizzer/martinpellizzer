                    <h1>Odontites serotinus var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Odontites serotinus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a panicle inflorescence during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Odontites serotinus.</p>
