<p>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides subsp.</p>
<p>typicum, commonly known as the typical adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a fleshy, spore-bearing sporangium that is prominently positioned on a short stalk, resembling an adder's tongue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinctive, elongated shape.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history.</p>
