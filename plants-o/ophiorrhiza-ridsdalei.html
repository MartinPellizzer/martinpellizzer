                <h1>Ophiorrhiza ridsdalei</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza ridsdalei, commonly known as the Ridsdale's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Dipterocarpaceae family, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Its small, white or pale green flowers are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza ridsdalei plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird and insect species.</p>
