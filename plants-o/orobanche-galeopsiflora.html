                    <h1>Orobanche galeopsiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche galeopsiflora, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
