<p>Orthochilus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant yellow or orange coloration with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
