<p>Ononis natrix subsp.</p>
<p>filifolia, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August.</p>
<p>The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its delicate, thread-like foliage and its ability to form dense mats, making it a characteristic component of certain ecological communities.</p>
