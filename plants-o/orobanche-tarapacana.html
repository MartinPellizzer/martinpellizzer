                    <h1>Orobanche tarapacana</h1>
<p>Orobanche tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean barrenweed, is a parasitic plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species of the genus Oryza. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
