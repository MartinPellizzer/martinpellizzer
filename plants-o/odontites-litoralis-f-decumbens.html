                    <h1>Odontites litoralis f. decumbens</h1>
<p>Odontites litoralis f. decumbens, commonly known as the coastal odontite, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This fern-like species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
