                    <h1>Orobanche petraea</h1>
<p>Orobanche petraea, commonly known as the desert broom.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be a concern for agricultural crops.</p>
