                    <h1>Orobus niger var. heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Orobus niger var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the black orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which give it a dramatic appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in a range of deep purple to near-black hues.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
