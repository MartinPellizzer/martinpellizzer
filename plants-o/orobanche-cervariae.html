                    <h1>Orobanche cervariae</h1>
<p>Orobanche cervariae, commonly known as the cattle dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pink flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germination in response to chemical signals from its host. The plant forms a haustorium, a specialized structure that attaches to the roots of its host, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in grasslands and agricultural areas where its host plants, such as grasses, are abundant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
