                    <h1>Oxygonium</h1>
<p>Oxygonium, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spiral-arranged leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, aiding in light capture and gas exchange. Oxygonium is also notable for its ability to produce oxygen through photosynthesis, contributing to water quality.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
