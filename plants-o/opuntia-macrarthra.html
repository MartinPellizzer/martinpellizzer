<p>Opuntia macrarthra, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia macrarthra is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and wildlife.</p>
