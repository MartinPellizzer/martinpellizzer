                    <h1>Orchis militaris var. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis militaris var. laxiflora, commonly known as the lax-flowered soldier's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in woodland or meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a typical feature of many orchid species, and it produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flowers compared to the typical form of Orchis militaris.</p>
