                    <h1>Ophrys × pseudobertolonii var. aurelia</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pseudobertolonii var. aurelia, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a yellowish-orange coloration and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's mimicry.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
