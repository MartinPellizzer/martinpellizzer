                    <h1>Ononis emarginata</h1>
<p>Ononis emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, evergreen leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils and access moisture from deep below the surface.</p>
<p>Ononis emarginata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
