<p>Olmedia maquira, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
