                    <h1>Orobanche alba f. maxima</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba f. maxima, commonly known as the white broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
