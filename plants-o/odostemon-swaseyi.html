<p>Odostemon swaseyi, commonly known as the Swasey's odostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odostemon swaseyi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
