<p>Ophrys amanensis subsp.</p>
<p>antalyensis, commonly known as the Antalya bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
