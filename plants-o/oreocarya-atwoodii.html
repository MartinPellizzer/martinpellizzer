                    <h1>Oreocarya atwoodii</h1>
<p>Oreocarya atwoodii, commonly known as the Atwood's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Oreocarya atwoodii is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
