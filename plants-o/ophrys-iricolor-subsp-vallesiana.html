<p>Ophrys iricolor subsp.</p>
<p>vallesiana, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
