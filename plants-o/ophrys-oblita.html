<p>Ophrys oblita, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like appearance, with a complex flower structure that mimics the female bee to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys oblita is a protected species in many European countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
