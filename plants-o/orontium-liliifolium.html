<p>Orontium liliifolium, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has smooth, waxy leaves that float on the surface of water, with a broad, arrowhead-shaped leaf blade. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Orontium liliifolium is often found in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
