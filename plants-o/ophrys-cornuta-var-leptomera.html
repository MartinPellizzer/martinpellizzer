                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. leptomera</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. leptomera, commonly known as the slender horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival.</p>
