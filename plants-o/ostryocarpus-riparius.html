<p>Ostryocarpus riparius, commonly known as the riverbank sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, three-ranked leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind, a common strategy among sedges.</p>
<p>Ostryocarpus riparius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
