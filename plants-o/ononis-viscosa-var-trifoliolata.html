                    <h1>Ononis viscosa var. trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Ononis viscosa var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leafed sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to harsh environments, with a compact growth form and efficient water-use mechanisms.</p>
