                    <h1>Ophrys sphegodes var. transhyrcana</h1>
<p>Ophrys sphegodes var. transhyrcana, commonly known as the Trans-Hyrkanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions with a cool, moist climate. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
