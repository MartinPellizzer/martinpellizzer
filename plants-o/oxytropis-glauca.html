                    <h1>Oxytropis glauca</h1>
<p>Oxytropis glauca, commonly known as blue locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, stiff leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Oxytropis glauca is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants.</p>
