                            <h1>Oxydectes Pauperula</h1>
<p>Common liver fluke, scientifically known as Oxydectes pauperula, is a parasitic flatworm that primarily infects the liver of cattle and other ruminants. This species belongs to the family Paramphistomidae and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Oxydectes pauperula is characterized by its small size and complex life cycle, which involves intermediate hosts such as snails and grass. The parasite can cause significant health issues in livestock, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses for farmers. Understanding its biology and transmission is crucial for effective control and prevention strategies.</p>
