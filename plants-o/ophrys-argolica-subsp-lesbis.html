<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>lesbis, commonly known as the Lesbian Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Lesvos. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a striking display of pale yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
