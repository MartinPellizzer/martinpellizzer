                    <h1>Ophrys × neowalteri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × neowalteri, commonly known as the Neowalter's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, across parts of Europe. Its flowers are usually a dark brown or black color with intricate patterns that resemble the body of a bee.</p>
<p>Ophrys × neowalteri is a relatively rare and specialized species, reflecting the unique evolutionary adaptations of orchids in their ecological niches.</p>
