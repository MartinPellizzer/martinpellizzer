                    <h1>Ochrothallus</h1>
<p>Ochrothallus, commonly known as the yellow thallus lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is distinguished by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which is composed of a fungal component and a photosynthetic algal partner. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. Ochrothallus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Its structure and coloration make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
