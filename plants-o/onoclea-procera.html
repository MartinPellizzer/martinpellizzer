<p>Onoclea procera, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Onoclea procera reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
