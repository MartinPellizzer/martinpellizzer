<p>Oenothera deltoides var. cognata, also known as the desert evening primrose, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. This resilient species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its unique blooming pattern and ecological importance make it a notable subject in botanical studies. The plant's ability to survive with minimal water highlights its significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
