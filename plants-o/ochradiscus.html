                    <h1>Ochradiscus</h1>
<p>Ochradiscus, commonly known as the "star-shaped water fern," is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, with a star-like appearance due to their notched edges. Ochradiscus species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The genus is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
