                    <h1>Opuntia funalis</h1>
<p>Opuntia funalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia funalis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily during the day.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
