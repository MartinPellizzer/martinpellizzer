                    <h1>Othonna humilis</h1>
<p>Othonna humilis, commonly known as the dwarf othonna, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
