<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>thracica, commonly known as the Thrace bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually dark brown to black in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
