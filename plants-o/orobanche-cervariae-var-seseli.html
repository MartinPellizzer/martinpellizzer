                    <h1>Orobanche cervariae var. seseli</h1>
<p>Orobanche cervariae var. seseli, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
