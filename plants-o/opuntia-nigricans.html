                    <h1>Opuntia nigricans</h1>
<p>Opuntia nigricans, commonly known as the black spine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in glochids, which are fine, hair-like spines that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia nigricans is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions.</p>
