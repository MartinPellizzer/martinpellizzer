<p>Orobanche minor subsp.</p>
<p>unicolor, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, often yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops by reducing their growth and yield.</p>
