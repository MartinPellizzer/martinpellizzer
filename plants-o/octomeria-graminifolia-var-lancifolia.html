<p>Octomeria graminifolia var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved octomeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped, which is a defining feature of the varietal name *lancifolia*.</p>
