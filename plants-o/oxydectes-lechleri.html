                    <h1>Oxydectes lechleri</h1>
<p>Oxydectes lechleri, commonly known as the caucho tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap that is widely used in the rubber industry. The plant has a thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support and helps protect the tree from environmental stress. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest.</p>
<p>The caucho tree plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of the Amazon ecosystem.</p>
