                    <h1>Orchis saccata var. fedtschenkoi</h1>
<p>Orchis saccata var. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's spurred orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are typically violet or purple in color, and its unique morphology adapted to its alpine habitat. The plant produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves and a cluster of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or scree environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
