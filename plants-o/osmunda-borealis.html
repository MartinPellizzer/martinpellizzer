<p>Osmunda borealis, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of lakes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda borealis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
