                    <h1>Ononis pallida</h1>
<p>Ononis pallida, commonly known as pale onys, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in rocky soils and sandy plains.</p>
<p>Ononis pallida is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
