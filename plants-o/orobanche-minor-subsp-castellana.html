<p>Orobanche minor subsp.</p>
<p>castellana, commonly known as the Castellana broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of southern Europe.</p>

<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a rare and specialized species in its habitat.</p>
