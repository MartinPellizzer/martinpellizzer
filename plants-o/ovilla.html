                    <h1>Ovilla</h1>
<p>Ovilla, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often opening at dawn. Ovilla thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, and its roots help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Nelumbo nucifera*, reflects its historical and cultural significance in various ancient civilizations.</p>
