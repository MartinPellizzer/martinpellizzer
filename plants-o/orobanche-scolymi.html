                    <h1>Orobanche scolymi</h1>
<p>Orobanche scolymi, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like tomatoes and beans.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and death of its host, making it a challenging plant to manage in cultivated fields.</p>
