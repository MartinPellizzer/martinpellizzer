<p>Opuntia saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>minutispina, commonly known as the small-spined rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems and small, spiny cladodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its adaptations include reduced leaf surface and thick, water-storing stems, making it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
