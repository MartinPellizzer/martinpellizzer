                    <h1>Odontites gordianii</h1>
<p>Odontites gordianii, commonly known as the gordian's toothplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontites gordianii is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
