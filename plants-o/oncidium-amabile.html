<p>Oncidium amabile, commonly known as the Elegant Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers.

Its leaves are strap-shaped, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
