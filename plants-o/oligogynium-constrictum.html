                    <h1>Oligogynium constrictum</h1>
<p>Oligogynium constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically found in the water or on damp soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>
<p>Oligogynium constrictum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
