                    <h1>Ophrys × robatschii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × robatschii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in late spring, displaying a range of colors from yellow to brown, depending on the specific genetic combination.</p>
