                    <h1>Olea europaea var. praecox</h1>
<p>Olea europaea var. praecox, commonly known as early olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more compact size compared to the standard olive tree, making it suitable for smaller gardens or containers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by olive fruits that ripen earlier than those of the typical olive variety. Its leaves are typically smaller and more lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
