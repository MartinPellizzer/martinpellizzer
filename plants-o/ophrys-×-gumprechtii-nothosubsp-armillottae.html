<p>Ophrys × gumprechtii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>armillottae, commonly known as the Armillottae bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that resemble female wasps, a characteristic feature of many Ophrys species. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
