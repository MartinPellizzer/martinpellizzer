<p>Oplismenus cristatus, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets arranged along slender stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Oplismenus cristatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
