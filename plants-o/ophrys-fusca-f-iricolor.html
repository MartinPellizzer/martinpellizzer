<p>Ophrys fusca f. iricolor, commonly known as the iridescent bee orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the bee orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive iridescent sheen, particularly noticeable under sunlight. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several European countries.</p>
