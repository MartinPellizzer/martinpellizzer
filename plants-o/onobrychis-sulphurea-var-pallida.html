<p>It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting, sulphur-yellow blooms that retain their color when dried.</p>
