                    <h1>Ongokea</h1>
<p>Ongokea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The trees are characterized by their dark, aromatic wood and are often found in moist, well-drained soils. Ongokea species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, white or yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild.</p>
