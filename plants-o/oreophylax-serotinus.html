<p>Oreophylax serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowering period occurs late in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Oreophylax serotinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine wildlife species.</p>
