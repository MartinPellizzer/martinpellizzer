<p>Ophrys candica subsp.</p>
<p>lacaena, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
