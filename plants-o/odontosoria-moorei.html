<p>Odontosoria moorei, commonly known as the Moore's tooth fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the shape of teeth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, segmented appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
