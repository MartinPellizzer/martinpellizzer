                    <h1>Oxytropis oxyphylla var. argentatifolia</h1>
<p>Oxytropis oxyphylla var. argentatifolia, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
