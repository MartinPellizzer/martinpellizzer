                    <h1>Oberonia reversidens</h1>
<p>Oberonia reversidens, commonly known as the reverse-stem orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive reverse orientation of the sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
