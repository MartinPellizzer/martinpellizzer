<p>Oxytropis argentata subsp.</p>
<p>brevidentata, commonly known as silverblue locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and spiny stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
