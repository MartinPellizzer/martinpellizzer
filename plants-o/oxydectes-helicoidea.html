                    <h1>Oxydectes helicoidea</h1>
<p>Oxydectes helicoidea, commonly known as the spiral waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that spiral around its stem.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface while the lower portion remains submerged. It is adapted to slow-moving or still waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
