The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
