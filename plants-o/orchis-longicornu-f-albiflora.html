                    <h1>Orchis longicornu f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis longicornu f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered longhorn orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a single, elongated flower spike with predominantly white petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
