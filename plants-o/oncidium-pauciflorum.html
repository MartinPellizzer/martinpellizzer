<p>Oncidium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them, and it thrives in humid, well-lit environments.</p>
<p>Oncidium pauciflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
