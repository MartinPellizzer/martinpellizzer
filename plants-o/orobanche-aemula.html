                    <h1>Orobanche aemula</h1>
<p>Orobanche aemula, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found parasitizing crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics and can influence the health of its host plants.</p>
