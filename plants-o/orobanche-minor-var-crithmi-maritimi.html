                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. crithmi-maritimi</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. crithmi-maritimi, commonly known as the sea cowpea dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically infests members of the Leguminosae family, such as Vicia and Lens. It is native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, thriving in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
