<p>Ottelia profundecordata, commonly known as the deepheart water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white.</p>
<p>Ottelia profundecordata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
