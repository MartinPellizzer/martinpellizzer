<p>Oligandra pachymorpha, commonly known as the thick-leaved olive, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
