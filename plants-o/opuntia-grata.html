                    <h1>Opuntia grata</h1>
<p>Opuntia grata, commonly known as the graceful prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia grata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
