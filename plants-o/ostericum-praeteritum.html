                    <h1>Ostericum praeteritum</h1>
<p>Ostericum praeteritum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically light green, with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spores are released in small quantities, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ostericum praeteritum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
