                    <h1>Onoclea orientalis</h1>
<p>Onoclea orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic environment.</p>
