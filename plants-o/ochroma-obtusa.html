<p>Ochroma obtusa, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lightweight wood, which is among the lightest in the world, due to its high air content. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The balsa tree is often cultivated for its unique wood and has ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
