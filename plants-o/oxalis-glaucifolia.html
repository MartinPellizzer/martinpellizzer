<p>Oxalis glaucifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive waxy, silver-blue coating on the underside, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Oxalis glaucifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
