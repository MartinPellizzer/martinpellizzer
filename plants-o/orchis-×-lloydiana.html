                    <h1>Orchis × lloydiana</h1>
<p>Orchis × lloydiana, commonly known as the Lloyd's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis ustulata.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the British Isles. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
