                    <h1>Opuntia compressa var. ammophila</h1>
<p>Opuntia compressa var. ammophila, commonly known as the sand flat cactus, is a perennial shrub native to coastal areas of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations include succulent tissues for water storage and a shallow root system to thrive in sandy, arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for coastal dunes and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
