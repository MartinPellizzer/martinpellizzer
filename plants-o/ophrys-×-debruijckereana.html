                    <h1>Ophrys × debruijckereana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × debruijckereana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-like labellum that mimics female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance and role in pollination dynamics.</p>
