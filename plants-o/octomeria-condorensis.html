<p>Octomeria condorensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Octomeria condorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
