<p>Orchis graminifolia var. kurokamiana, commonly known as the Kurokamiana grass orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
