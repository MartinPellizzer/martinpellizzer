                    <h1>Opuntia mandragora</h1>
<p>Opuntia mandragora, commonly known as the devil's tongue, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and spiny edges, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it conserve water.</p>
<p>Opuntia mandragora is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
