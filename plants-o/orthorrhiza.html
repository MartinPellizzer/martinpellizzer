                    <h1>Orthorrhiza</h1>
<p>Orthorrhiza, commonly known as the "straight root" system, is a type of root structure found in certain plants, particularly in the order Poales.</p>
<p>This system is characterized by a single, primary root that grows straight downward, providing strong anchorage and efficient water and nutrient absorption. Unlike fibrous root systems, orthorrhiza lacks secondary roots, making it simpler in structure. It is commonly observed in grasses and some aquatic plants.</p>
<p>The straight root system is well adapted to environments where deep water or compact soil is present.</p>
