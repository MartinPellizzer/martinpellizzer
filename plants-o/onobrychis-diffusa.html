<p>Onobrychis diffusa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its climbing habit, supported by tendrils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Onobrychis diffusa is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its capacity to suppress weeds.</p>
