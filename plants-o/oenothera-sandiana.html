<p>Oenothera sandiana, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Oenothera sandiana is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
