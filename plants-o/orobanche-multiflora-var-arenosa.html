                    <h1>Orobanche multiflora var. arenosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche multiflora var. arenosa, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat preferences, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
