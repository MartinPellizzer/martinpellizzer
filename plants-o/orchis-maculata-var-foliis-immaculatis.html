<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale green flowers with a distinctive greenish-brown lip. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and often lack the dark spots found in the typical variety of Orchis maculata.</p>
