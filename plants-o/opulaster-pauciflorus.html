The plant has a woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
