                    <h1>Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. longepedunculum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. longepedunculum, commonly known as the long-stalked adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that resemble the tongue of a snake. The plant produces a single, elongated spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically positioned at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
