                    <h1>Orchidocarpum</h1>
<p>Orchidocarpum, commonly known as the "spider orchid," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures, which typically feature a lip or labellum that distinguishes them from other orchid species. Orchidocarpum species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Their roots are often specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air, a trait common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>The genus is noted for its diverse floral morphology, which plays a key role in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
