<p>It features whorled leaves that are broad, flat, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its floating leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
