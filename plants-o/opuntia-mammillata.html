                    <h1>Opuntia mammillata</h1>
<p>Opuntia mammillata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia mammillata is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in desert ecosystems.</p>
