                    <h1>Ostodes</h1>
<p>Ostodes, commonly known as the "whisk fern," is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and roots, instead having small, hair-like structures called rhizomes and sporangia. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems that bear clusters of sporangia at the tips. Ostodes thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
