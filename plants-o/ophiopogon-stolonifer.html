                    <h1>Ophiopogon stolonifer</h1>
<p>Ophiopogon stolonifer, commonly known as the Japanese woodland spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by blue-black berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread and form thick mats, making it effective for ground cover.</p>
