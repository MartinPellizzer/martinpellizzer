<p>Onuris graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy onuris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, Onuris graminifolia is notable for its simple morphology and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
