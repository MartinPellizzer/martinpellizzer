<p>Orchis morio f. unilobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>The variety unilobata is distinguished by its narrow leaf blades and reduced floral features compared to the typical form.</p>
