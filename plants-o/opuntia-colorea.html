<p>Opuntia colorea, commonly known as the colorful prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically red or orange in color. Opuntia colorea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
