<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated through a unique mimicry mechanism that attracts male bees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>
