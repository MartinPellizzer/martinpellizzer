<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>olimpiadae, commonly known as the Olympic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. This subspecies is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking blend of yellow and brown hues that closely resemble the bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
