<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
