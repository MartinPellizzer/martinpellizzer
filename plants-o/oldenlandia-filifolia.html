<p>Oldenlandia filifolia, commonly known as the thread-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, thread-like leaves and white, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed or shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
