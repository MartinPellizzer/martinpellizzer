                    <h1>Othonna umbelliformis</h1>
<p>Othonna umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Othonna umbelliformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
