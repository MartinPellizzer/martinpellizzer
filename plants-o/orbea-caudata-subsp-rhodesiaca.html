<p>Orbea caudata subsp.</p>
<p>rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions as a decorative plant.</p>
