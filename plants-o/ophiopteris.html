                    <h1>Ophiopteris</h1>
<p>Ophiopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ophiopteris species are characterized by their delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often form dense, floating mats on the water's surface. The sporangia, which produce spores, are usually clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature that aids in their reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and ecological role, Ophiopteris species are often indicators of healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p>
