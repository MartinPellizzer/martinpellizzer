                    <h1>Odontoptera</h1>
<p>Odontoptera, commonly known as the orchid mantis, is a striking example of mimicry in the plant-animal interface.</p>
<p>While not a true plant, it is often mistaken for a flower due to its intricate, petal-like appendages. The plant-like appearance serves as a defense mechanism against predators. Its body is covered in fine, translucent wings that resemble delicate petals.</p>
<p>This mimicry allows it to blend seamlessly with its environment, enhancing its survival in tropical habitats.</p>
