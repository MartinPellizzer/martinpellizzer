                    <h1>Orchis saccata f. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Orchis saccata f. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular orchid, is a botanical variant of the common twayblade.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (circle-shaped) leaves, which differ from the typical linear leaves of the species. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a unique structure that reflects its evolutionary adaptations for pollination.</p>
