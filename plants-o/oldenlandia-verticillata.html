<p>Oldenlandia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in whorls around the stem. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in humid environments and can be a host for various insects and other organisms.</p>
