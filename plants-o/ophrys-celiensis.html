                    <h1>Ophrys celiensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys celiensis, commonly known as the Celi's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, orchid-like flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ophrys celiensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
