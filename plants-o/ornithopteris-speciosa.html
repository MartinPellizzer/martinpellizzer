                    <h1>Ornithopteris speciosa</h1>
<p>Ornithopteris speciosa, commonly known as the showy maidenhair fern, is a striking species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a vivid contrast of green and red hues, especially during the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from small, fleshy structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Ornithopteris speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
