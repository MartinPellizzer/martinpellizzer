                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. taurina</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. taurina, commonly known as the Taurine rice, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stature and smaller grain size compared to other rice varieties. This plant typically thrives in temperate climates and requires a shorter growing season. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a culm that is often more robust than that of standard rice.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural adaptation.</p>
