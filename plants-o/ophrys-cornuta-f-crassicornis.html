<p>Ophrys cornuta f. crassicornis, commonly known as the broad-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained, alkaline soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as endangered in several regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
