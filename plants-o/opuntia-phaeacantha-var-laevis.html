                    <h1>Opuntia phaeacantha var. laevis</h1>
<p>Opuntia phaeacantha var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in fine, soft spines rather than the more prominent ones found in other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into flattened stems, a typical feature of cacti adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "laevis" refers to its smooth, hairless surface, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Opuntia phaeacantha species complex.</p>
