                            <h1>Oxalis Corniculata Subvar. Piletocarpa</h1>
<p>Wood sorrel, scientifically known as Oxalis corniculata subvar. piletocarpa, is a delicate yet resilient plant commonly found in moist, shaded environments around the world. This species belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is recognized for its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. Despite its beauty, it is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in various ecosystems. The plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic to humans and animals if ingested in large quantities. Its unique appearance and ecological impact make it a subject of both admiration and caution in botanical studies.</p>
