<p>Ophrys kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>cretica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
