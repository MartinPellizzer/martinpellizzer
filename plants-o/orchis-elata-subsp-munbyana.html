<p>Orchis elata subsp.</p>
<p>munbyana, commonly known as the Munby's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale pink to lilac-colored flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
