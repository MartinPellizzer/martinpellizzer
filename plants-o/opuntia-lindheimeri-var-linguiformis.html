                    <h1>Opuntia lindheimeri var. linguiformis</h1>
<p>Opuntia lindheimeri var. linguiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically narrow and ribbed, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
