                    <h1>Oroya</h1>
<p>Oroya, commonly known as the "angel's trumpets," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly the Andes region, and includes several species such as *Brugmansia* and *Datura*. These plants are characterized by their large, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to deep red. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value but contain toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Oroya species are also used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to their potent chemical composition.</p>
