                    <h1>Opuntia fragilis var. denudata</h1>
<p>Opuntia fragilis var. denudata, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered with spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are modified for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</p>
