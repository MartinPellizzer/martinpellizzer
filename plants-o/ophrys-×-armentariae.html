                    <h1>Ophrys × armentariae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × armentariae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys armeniaca.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a tall flowering stem with multiple showy, bee-like flowers.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
