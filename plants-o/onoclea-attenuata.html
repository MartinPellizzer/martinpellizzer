                    <h1>Onoclea attenuata</h1>
<p>Onoclea attenuata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
