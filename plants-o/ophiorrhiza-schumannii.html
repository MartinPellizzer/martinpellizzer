                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza schumannii</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to its host. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity.</p>
