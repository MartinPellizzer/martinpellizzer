                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza dulongensis</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host while performing photosynthesis. Its small, clustered leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza dulongensis is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
