<p>Opuntia kleiniae, commonly known as the Kleinia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red or orange fruits. Opuntia kleiniae is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
