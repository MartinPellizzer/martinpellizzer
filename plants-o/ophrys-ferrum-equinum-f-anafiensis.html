The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its endemic habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche.</p>
