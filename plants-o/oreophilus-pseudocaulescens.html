<p>It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and clusters of small, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
