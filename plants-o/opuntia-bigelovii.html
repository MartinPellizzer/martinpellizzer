<p>Opuntia bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelov's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia bigelovii is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
