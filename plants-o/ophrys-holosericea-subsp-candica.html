<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>candica, commonly known as the Candica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow-and-brown coloration and intricate patterns. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
