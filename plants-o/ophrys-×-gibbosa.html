                    <h1>Ophrys × gibbosa</h1>
<p>Ophrys × gibbosa, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically pale yellow with dark markings, and it thrives in calcareous soils across Europe.</p>
<p>This orchid is a testament to the evolutionary adaptations and hybridization processes in the plant kingdom.</p>
