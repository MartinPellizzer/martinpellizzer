                    <h1>Orthanthella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Orthanthella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate orthanthella, is a rare and delicate liverwort species belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Orthanthella lanceolata is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
