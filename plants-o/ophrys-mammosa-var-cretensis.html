                    <h1>Ophrys mammosa var. cretensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys mammosa var. cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan Fly Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
