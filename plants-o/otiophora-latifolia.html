                    <h1>Otiophora latifolia</h1>
<p>Otiophora latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses broad, ovate leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Otiophora latifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties.</p>
