<p>Orchis fuchsii subsp.</p>
<p>rhoumensis, commonly known as the Rhodope orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-purple coloration.</p>
<p>The plant has a complex root system and is adapted to grow in calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it plays a significant role in the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
