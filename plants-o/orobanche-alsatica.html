                    <h1>Orobanche alsatica</h1>
<p>Orobanche alsatica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species such as thistles and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
