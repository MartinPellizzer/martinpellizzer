<p>Ophryoscleria lucida, commonly known as the shining-eyed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a bright yellow to orange upper surface and a darker, often darker green or brown lower surface. The thallus is typically leathery and measures between 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
