<p>Orostachys malacophylla var. malacophylla, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, often in spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
