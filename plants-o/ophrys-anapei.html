                    <h1>Ophrys anapei</h1>
<p>Ophrys anapei, commonly known as the Anapei bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Ophrys anapei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
