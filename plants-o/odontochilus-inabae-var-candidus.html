                    <h1>Odontochilus inabae var. candidus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus inabae var. candidus, commonly known as the white-veined toothed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, toothed leaf margins and pale green to white veined leaves that distinguish it from other members of the genus. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high elevation and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
