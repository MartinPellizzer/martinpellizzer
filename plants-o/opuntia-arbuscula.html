                    <h1>Opuntia arbuscula</h1>
<p>Opuntia arbuscula, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its leaves are modified into spine-like structures, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia arbuscula is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
