                    <h1>Oxydectes gossypifolia var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Oxydectes gossypifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the woollyleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, while the stems are thick and ribbed.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its variation in leaf shape, which can range from broad to narrow, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
