                    <h1>Ophioglossum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum coriaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive tongue-like shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
