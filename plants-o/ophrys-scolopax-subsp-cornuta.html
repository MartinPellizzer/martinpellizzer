<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip, which mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
