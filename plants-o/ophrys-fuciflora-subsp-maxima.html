<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>maxima, commonly known as the large green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies maxima is distinguished by its larger flower size and more robust growth compared to other members of the Ophrys genus.</p>
