<p>Oryzopsis grisebachii, commonly known as the gray beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Oryzopsis grisebachii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological importance in arid landscapes.</p>
