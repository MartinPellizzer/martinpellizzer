<p>Odontites vernus var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in early spring. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive toothed leaf margins and the hairy texture of its stem and leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect life.</p>
