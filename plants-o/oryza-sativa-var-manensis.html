                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. manensis</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. manensis, commonly known as the Manchurian rice, is a wild rice species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its grains are smaller and less cultivated compared to domesticated rice varieties.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to the genus Oryza and is considered an important species for genetic diversity in rice breeding programs.</p>
