                    <h1>Ochna roraimae</h1>
<p>Ochna roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima ochna, is a rare shrub endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland plateaus, adapting to the unique microclimates of these isolated regions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to the extreme environmental conditions of the tepuis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
