<p>Ophrys aegirtica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators.
