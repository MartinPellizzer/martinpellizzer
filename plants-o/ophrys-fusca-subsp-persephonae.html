<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>persephonae, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
