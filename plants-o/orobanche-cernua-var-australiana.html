                    <h1>Orobanche cernua var. australiana</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua var. australiana, commonly known as the Australian common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and herbs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spikelike inflorescence, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants. It is an annual species, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
