                    <h1>Ophrys penelopeae</h1>
<p>Ophrys penelopeae, commonly known as the Penelope's bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. Ophrys penelopeae thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
