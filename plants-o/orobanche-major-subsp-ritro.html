<p>Orobanche major subsp.</p>
<p>ritro, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish flowers, typically in late summer, and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its hosts for water and minerals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops such as legumes and sunflowers.</p>
