                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. okellyi</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. okellyi, commonly known as the Okelly's spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its striking purple and yellow floral markings, which are more pronounced than in the typical form of Orchis maculata. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in rich, organic soils. The plant produces a single, showy spike of flowers, each with a unique combination of color patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
