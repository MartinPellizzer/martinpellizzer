                    <h1>Ophrys × peloponnesiaca</h1>
<p>Ophrys × peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that closely resemble female bees, a trait evolved to enhance pollination efficiency. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Ophrys × peloponnesiaca results from crossbreeding between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, contributing to its unique floral morphology.</p>
