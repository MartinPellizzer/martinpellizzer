                    <h1>Orobanche cilicica</h1>
<p>Orobanche cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
