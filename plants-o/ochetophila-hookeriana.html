<p>Ochetophila hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's ochetophila, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family, and is often found growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine plant adaptations and conservation.</p>
