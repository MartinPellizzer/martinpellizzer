                    <h1>Onoclea struthiopteris var. pensylvanica</h1>
<p>Onoclea struthiopteris var. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania barren bell, is a variant of the barren bell fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a fan-shaped structure. Its leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and lack the spore-producing structures found in other ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
