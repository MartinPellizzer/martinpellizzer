<p>Orobanche singarensis, commonly known as the Singarensis broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
