                    <h1>Oserya biceps</h1>
<p>Oserya biceps, commonly known as the two-armed oserya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan. Oserya biceps is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
