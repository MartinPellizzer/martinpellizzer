                    <h1>Orchis incarnata var. borealis</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and the plant produces small, dark brown capsules as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
