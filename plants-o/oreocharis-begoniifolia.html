<p>Oreocharis begoniifolia, commonly known as the begoniifolia stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to China.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
