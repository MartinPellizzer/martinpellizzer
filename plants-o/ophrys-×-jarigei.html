                    <h1>Ophrys × jarigei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × jarigei, commonly known as the jarigei bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with specialized structures called labellum and column, which mimic the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Ophrys × jarigei typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and mimicry.</p>
