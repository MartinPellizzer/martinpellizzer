<p>Ophrys umbilicata var. khuzestanica, commonly known as the Khuzestan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southwestern regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
