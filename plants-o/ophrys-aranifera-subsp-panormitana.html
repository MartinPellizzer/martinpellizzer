<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils in open habitats such as rocky slopes and scrublands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
