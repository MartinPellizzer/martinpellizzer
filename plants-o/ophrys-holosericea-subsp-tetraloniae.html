<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>tetraloniae, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, hairy sepals and petals that form a bee-like shape, enhancing its mimicry. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
