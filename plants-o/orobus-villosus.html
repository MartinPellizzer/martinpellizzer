                    <h1>Orobus villosus</h1>
<p>Orobus villosus, commonly known as the hairy orobrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Orobus villosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and scrubland ecosystems.</p>
