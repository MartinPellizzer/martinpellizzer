                    <h1>Opuntia littoralis</h1>
<p>Opuntia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia littoralis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its thick stems makes it highly resilient to drought conditions.</p>
