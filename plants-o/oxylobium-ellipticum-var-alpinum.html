                    <h1>Oxylobium ellipticum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Oxylobium ellipticum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine oxylobium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
