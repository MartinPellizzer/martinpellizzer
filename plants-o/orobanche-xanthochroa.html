                    <h1>Orobanche xanthochroa</h1>
<p>Orobanche xanthochroa, commonly known as the yellow root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces erect, branched inflorescences with tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a pest in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and establishing a haustorium to extract water and nutrients.</p>
