<p>Oscularia prasina, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
