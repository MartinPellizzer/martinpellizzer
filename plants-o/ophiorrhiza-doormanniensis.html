<p>Ophiorrhiza doormanniensis, commonly known as the Doormann's mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along the shores of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, coastal habitat. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
