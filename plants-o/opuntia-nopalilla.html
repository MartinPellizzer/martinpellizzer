<p>Opuntia nopalilla, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spiny areoles and clusters of short, stiff spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia nopalilla is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
