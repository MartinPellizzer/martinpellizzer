                    <h1>Orchis × alata</h1>
<p>Orchis × alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands across Europe. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive wing-like structure on the petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Orchis × alata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
