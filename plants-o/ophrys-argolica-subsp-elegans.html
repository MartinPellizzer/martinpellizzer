<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the Argolic Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southern Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-pollinated lip that mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
