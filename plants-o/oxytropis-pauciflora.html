                    <h1>Oxytropis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Oxytropis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green, hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers in early summer, which are followed by slender, cylindrical legumes containing several seeds. Oxytropis pauciflora has deep taproots that allow it to survive in poor, dry soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
