<p>Opuntia barkleyana, commonly known as the Barkley's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which are distinctive features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia barkleyana plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
