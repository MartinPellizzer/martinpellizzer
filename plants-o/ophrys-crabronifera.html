                    <h1>Ophrys crabronifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys crabronifera, commonly known as the wasp orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly intricate flowers that closely resemble wasps, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers have a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a wasp's body.</p>
<p>This mimicry attracts male wasps, which in turn facilitate cross-pollination through their behavior.</p>
