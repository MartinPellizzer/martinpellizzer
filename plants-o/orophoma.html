                    <h1>Orophoma</h1>
<p>Orophoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Orophoma has long, thin roots that help it anchor to bark and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
