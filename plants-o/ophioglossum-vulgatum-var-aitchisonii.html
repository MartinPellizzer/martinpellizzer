                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a unique, primitive morphology with a single, elongated leaf that is typically dark green and has a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
