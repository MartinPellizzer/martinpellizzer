                    <h1>Olinia huillensis</h1>
<p>Olinia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has a cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Olinia huillensis is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique botanical specimen.</p>
