                    <h1>Orchis patens var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Orchis patens var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in unstable coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to maritime climates.</p>
