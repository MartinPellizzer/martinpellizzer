<p>Ophrys insectifera f. dubia, commonly known as the mimic orchid or the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-shaped flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
