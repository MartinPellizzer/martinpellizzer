<p>Opuntia lemaireana, commonly known as the Lemaire's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia lemaireana is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert flora.</p>
