<p>Oligosporus salsoloides, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline soils and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
