                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with no true leaves. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by attaching to host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
