                    <h1>Orobanche ligustri</h1>
<p>Orobanche ligustri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as those in the genus Prunus, and can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Its life cycle involves producing small, reddish-brown seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
