                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera lusus viridiflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera lusus viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly adapted for pseudocopulation, a pollination strategy involving mimicry. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
