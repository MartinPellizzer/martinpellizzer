                    <h1>Orchis mascula f. brevibracteata</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula f. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted male orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common male orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced bracts, which are shorter and less prominent compared to the typical form. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the UK. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
