                    <h1>Orobanche aeginetia</h1>
<p>Orobanche aeginetia, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with a short, swollen stem and a cluster of small, scale-like leaves. It typically parasitizes leguminous plants such as vetch and clover, weakening them by drawing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays an important role in certain ecosystems as a specialist parasite.</p>
