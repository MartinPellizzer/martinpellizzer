<p>Ophrys sicula subsp.</p>
<p>galilaea, commonly known as the Galilaea bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs or slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
