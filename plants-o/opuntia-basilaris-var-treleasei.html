                    <h1>Opuntia basilaris var. treleasei</h1>
<p>Opuntia basilaris var. treleasei, commonly known as the Trelease's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its areoles bear clusters of spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
