<p>Oceaniopteris cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous sea fern, is a marine plant belonging to the family Cystothecaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble the structure of a fern, though it is not closely related to true ferns. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are composed of a flexible, cartilage-like tissue that allows it to withstand wave action.</p>
<p>Oceaniopteris cartilaginea plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
