<p>Ophrys holosericea psp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctively shaped lip that plays a key role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
