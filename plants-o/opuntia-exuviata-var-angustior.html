                    <h1>Opuntia exuviata var. angustior</h1>
<p>Opuntia exuviata var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to desert conditions, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in poor soil.</p>
