<p>Oncidium truncatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, white, and green. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Oncidium truncatum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
