<p>Ononis natrix f. barcinensis, commonly known as the Barcino sandwort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
