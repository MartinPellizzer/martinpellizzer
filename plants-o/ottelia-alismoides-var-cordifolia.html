                    <h1>Ottelia alismoides var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Ottelia alismoides var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf waterplantain, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Ottelia alismoides var. cordifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
