<p>Ochyrorchis mannii, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring a moist, shaded environment with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Ochyrorchis mannii is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
