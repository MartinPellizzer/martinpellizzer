                    <h1>Ophelia purpurascens var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Ophelia purpurascens var. ciliata, commonly known as the purple loosestrife, is a flowering plant native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and dense clusters of showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, while the variety *ciliata* is distinguished by its finely toothed margins. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to water-saturated soils.</p>
<p>This plant is often invasive in North America, outcompeting native vegetation in aquatic environments.</p>
