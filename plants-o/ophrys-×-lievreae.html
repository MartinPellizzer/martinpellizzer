                    <h1>Ophrys × lievreae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lievreae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure designed to mimic female bees, which attracts male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and meadows in southern Europe. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>The hybrid is considered a natural hybrid, showcasing the adaptability and evolutionary strategies of orchids in their ecological niches.</p>
