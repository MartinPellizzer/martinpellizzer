                    <h1>Orobanche tacnaensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche tacnaensis, commonly known as the Tacna dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Chenopodium. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>However, its limited distribution and specific host requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
