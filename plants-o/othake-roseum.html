<p>Othake roseum, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive pink hue. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Othake roseum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
