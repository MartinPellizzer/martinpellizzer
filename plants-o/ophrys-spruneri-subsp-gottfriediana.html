<p>Ophrys spruneri subsp.</p>
<p>gottfriediana, commonly known as the Gottfried's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
