                    <h1>Ophrys lucis var. atargatis</h1>
<p>Ophrys lucis var. atargatis, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are pale green with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
