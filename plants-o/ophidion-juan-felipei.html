                    <h1>Ophidion juan-felipei</h1>
<p>Ophidion juan-felipei, commonly known as the Juan Felipe's sea snake, is a venomous elapid snake found in the coastal waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive coloration, often featuring a dark dorsal pattern with lighter markings. The plant name may be a misnomer, as this species is not a plant but a marine reptile. It plays a significant role in its ecosystem as both predator and prey.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
