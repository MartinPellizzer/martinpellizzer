                    <h1>Octodon setosum</h1>
<p>Octodon setosum, commonly known as the hairy viscacha, is a species of rodent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wool-like fur that provides insulation against the harsh desert climate. The plant's botanical aspects are not directly relevant, as Octodon setosum is an animal, not a plant. However, it inhabits areas with specific vegetation, including shrubs and sparse grasses.</p>
<p>Its survival depends on the availability of these plant resources for shelter and foraging.</p>
