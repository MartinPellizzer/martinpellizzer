                    <h1>Ophrys × daneschiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × daneschiana, commonly known as the Danes' orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys citrina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation. This mimicry is a key adaptation that enhances its pollination success by attracting male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
