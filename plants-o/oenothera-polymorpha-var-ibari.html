                    <h1>Oenothera polymorpha var. ibari</h1>
<p>Oenothera polymorpha var. ibari, commonly known as the Ibari evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, a trait typical of the evening primrose genus. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated evening primroses, offering genetic diversity for horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
