                    <h1>Oxytropis</h1>
<p>Oxytropis, commonly known as locoweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their erect or sprawling growth habit and often have compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to purple, depending on the species.</p>
<p>Many Oxytropis species are toxic to livestock, earning them their common name due to their association with poisoning in grazing animals.</p>
