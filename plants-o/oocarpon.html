                    <h1>Oocarpon</h1>
<p>Oocarpon, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, dark brown fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange pericarp. Oocarpon species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance but are distinct in their botanical classification and ecological preferences.</p>
