                    <h1>Orobanche tetuanensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with no true leaves. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
