                    <h1>Ophrys × arachnitiformis f. specularia</h1>
<p>Ophrys × arachnitiformis f. specularia, commonly known as the "Mirror Orchid," is a rare hybrid orchid species characterized by its intricate floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its specialized morphology, including a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Ophrys arachnitiformis and Ophrys speculum, resulting in a distinct floral form. It is typically found in specific habitats with well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid example of adaptive evolution and mimicry in orchids.</p>
