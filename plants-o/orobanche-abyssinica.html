                    <h1>Orobanche abyssinica</h1>
<p>Orobanche abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, as it attaches to its host through haustoria. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
