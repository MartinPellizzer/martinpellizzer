                    <h1>Orobanche sanguinea var. maritima</h1>
<p>Orobanche sanguinea var. maritima, commonly known as the sea holopedium, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically attaches to the roots of various host plants, such as grasses and legumes, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to coastal regions and thrives in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
