                    <h1>Ophiopteris verticillata</h1>
<p>Ophiopteris verticillata, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ophiopteris verticillata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
