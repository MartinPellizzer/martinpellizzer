                    <h1>Ophrys × lavolpei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lavolpei, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in deception.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in calcareous grasslands and is a rare example of successful interspecific hybridization in the orchid genus.</p>
