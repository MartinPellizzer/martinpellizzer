<p>Ophiorrhiza humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small, shrub-like plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Ophiorrhiza humilis is typically found in intertidal zones and is adapted to tolerate saltwater conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
