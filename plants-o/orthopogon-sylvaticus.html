<p>Orthopogon sylvaticus, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually unbranched and produce small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
