                    <h1>Orchis latifolia f. pumila</h1>
<p>Orchis latifolia f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with shorter stems and smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
