<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>pseudospeculum, commonly known as the mimic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that have evolved to mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are rich in nectar and emit a subtle scent that enhances the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
