                <h1>Odontophyllum phoberum</h1>
<p>Odontophyllum phoberum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking white, ghost-like flowers that appear during the dry season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
