                    <h1>Opisthopappus</h1>
<p>Opisthopappus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Opisthopappus species are characterized by their erect, branched stems and small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
