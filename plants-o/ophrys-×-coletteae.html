                    <h1>Ophrys × coletteae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × coletteae, commonly known as the Colette's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are intricately designed to deceive bees into attempting to mate with them, thereby facilitating pollination. The hybrid nature of Ophrys × coletteae results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, leading to unique floral characteristics.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
