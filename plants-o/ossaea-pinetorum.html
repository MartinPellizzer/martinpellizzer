                    <h1>Ossaea pinetorum</h1>
<p>Ossaea pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest moss, is a rare and specialized moss species found in shaded, moist environments within pine forests.</p>
<p>It has a dense, carpet-like growth habit and features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore capsules that are borne on short stalks, and they often remain hidden beneath the mossy mat. Ossaea pinetorum plays a crucial role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest conditions.</p>
