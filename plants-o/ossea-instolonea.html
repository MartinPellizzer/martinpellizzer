                    <h1>Ossea instolonea</h1>
<p>Ossea instolonea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom once a year, typically in the summer months. Ossea instolonea thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of moisture and rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species.</p>
