                    <h1>Orthiopteris domingensis</h1>
<p>Orthiopteris domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Orthiopteris domingensis plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity.</p>
