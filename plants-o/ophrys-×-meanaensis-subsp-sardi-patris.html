<p>Ophrys × meanaensis subsp.</p>
<p>sardi-patris, commonly known as the Sardinian-Patris orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Sardinia and southern Italy. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
