                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. engelmannii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. engelmannii, commonly known as the spurred adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, spurred spores and distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, large, lanceolate leaf that has a broad, tongue-like shape. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaf, which are protected by specialized, spurred structures. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
