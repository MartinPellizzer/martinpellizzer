                    <h1>Orchidantha borneensis</h1>
<p>Orchidantha borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the environment, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Orchidantha borneensis is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
