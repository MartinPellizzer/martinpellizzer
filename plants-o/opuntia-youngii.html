<p>Opuntia youngii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tunah, is a large, segmented berry that contains edible seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia youngii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival.</p>
