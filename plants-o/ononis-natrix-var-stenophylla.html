<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
