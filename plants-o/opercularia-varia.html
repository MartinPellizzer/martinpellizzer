<p>Opercularia varia, commonly known as the yellow opercularia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellow to orange in color, and a distinctive operculum that covers the apothecia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a fungal component (ascomycete) and a photosynthetic partner (cyanobacteria or green algae).</p>
<p>Opercularia varia plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
