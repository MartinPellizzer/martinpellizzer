                    <h1>Orchis patens var. canariensis</h1>
<p>Orchis patens var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its germination and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
