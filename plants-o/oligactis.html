                    <h1>Oligactis</h1>
<p>Oligactis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. It is known for its lack of leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Oligactis is considered critically endangered.</p>
