                    <h1>Orchis × braunii var. townsendiana</h1>
<p>Orchis × braunii var. townsendiana, commonly known as Townsend's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and anchoring.</p>
