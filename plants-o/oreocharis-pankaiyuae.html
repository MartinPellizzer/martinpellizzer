<p>Oreocharis pankaiyuae, commonly known as the Pankaiyua's oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Hydrangeaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers.

Its foliage is usually dark green with a glossy texture, and the flowers can range in color from white to pale pink, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis pankaiyuae is considered a delicate species with conservation concerns.</p>
