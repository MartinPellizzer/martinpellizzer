<p>Ophrys × sivana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sivana is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in temperate climates across Europe.</p>
