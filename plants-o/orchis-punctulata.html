                    <h1>Orchis punctulata</h1>
<p>Orchis punctulata, commonly known as the dotted twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is notable for its specialized symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive yellow or greenish spot on the lip, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Orchis punctulata is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
