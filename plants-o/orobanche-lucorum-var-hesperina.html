                    <h1>Orobanche lucorum var. hesperina</h1>
<p>Orobanche lucorum var. hesperina, commonly known as the western broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its flowers are usually clustered in a spike-like inflorescence and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in certain regions of Europe.</p>
