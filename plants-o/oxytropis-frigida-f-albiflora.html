                    <h1>Oxytropis frigida f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Oxytropis frigida f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh environments. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Oxytropis frigida f. albiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
