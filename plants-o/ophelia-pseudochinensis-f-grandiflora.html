                    <h1>Ophelia pseudochinensis f. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Ophelia pseudochinensis f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant water-plantain, is a striking aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
