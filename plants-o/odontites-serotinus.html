<p>Odontites serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant.

Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Odontites serotinus is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
