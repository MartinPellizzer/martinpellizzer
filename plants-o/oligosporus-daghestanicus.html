                    <h1>Oligosporus daghestanicus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus daghestanicus, commonly known as the Daghestan oligosporus, is a rare and lesser-known fungal species belonging to the family Sordariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, globose to subglobose spores that are typically 12â€“15 micrometers in diameter. The fungus is primarily found in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in the Republic of Dagestan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ecological role is largely unknown, though it is suspected to contribute to the decomposition of organic matter in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and limited study, Oligosporus daghestanicus remains a subject of interest for mycologists and conservationists.</p>
