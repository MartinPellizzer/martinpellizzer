                    <h1>Orobanche aconiti-lycoctoni</h1>
<p>Orobanche aconiti-lycoctoni, commonly known as the great yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers, often in clusters, and has a short, stout stem with few leaves. It is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for sustenance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
