                    <h1>Opuntia rauhii</h1>
<p>Opuntia rauhii, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures that bear the plant's defensive spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red or orange fruit that contains edible seeds. Opuntia rauhii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
