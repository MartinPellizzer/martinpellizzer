<p>Opuntia rufida, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially in full sun. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-orange fruits known as tunas. Its spiny stems and leaves are adapted to thrive in arid environments, storing water and minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia rufida is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widely distributed species.</p>
