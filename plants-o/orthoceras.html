                    <h1>Orthoceras</h1>
<p>Orthoceras, commonly known as the straight cone snail, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Cephalopoda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is typically smooth and spirally arranged. The shell provides protection for the soft body of the snail, which includes a muscular foot and a radula used for feeding. Orthoceras thrived during the Paleozoic era and is often found as a fossil in marine sedimentary rock layers.</p>
<p>Its simple anatomy and evolutionary significance make it an important subject in the study of ancient marine ecosystems.</p>
