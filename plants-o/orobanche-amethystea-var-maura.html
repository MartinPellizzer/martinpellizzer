                    <h1>Orobanche amethystea var. maura</h1>
<p>Orobanche amethystea var. maura, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its ecological role. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops if not managed properly.</p>
