<p>Orontium molle, commonly known as the smooth marsh willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Orontium molle plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
