<p>Opuntia clavellina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains small, seed-like structures.</p>
<p>Opuntia clavellina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and minimizing water loss through its waxy coating.</p>
