                    <h1>Orobanche salisii</h1>
<p>Orobanche salisii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology, with no true leaves or stems. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
