<p>Ophrys iricolor f. omegaifera, commonly known as the Omega orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
