                    <h1>Opuntia bernardina</h1>
<p>Opuntia bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia bernardina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
