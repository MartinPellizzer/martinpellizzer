<p>Orostachys stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orostachy, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
