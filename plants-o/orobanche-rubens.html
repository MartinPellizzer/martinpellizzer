                    <h1>Orobanche rubens</h1>
<p>Orobanche rubens, commonly known as the red broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, reddish stems and small, showy flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes various species of legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a parasitic connection.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
