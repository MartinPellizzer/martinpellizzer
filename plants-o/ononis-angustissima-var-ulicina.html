                    <h1>Ononis angustissima var. ulicina</h1>
<p>Ononis angustissima var. ulicina, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils.</p>
