                    <h1>Oryza glaberrima var. longiglumis</h1>
<p>Oryza glaberrima var. longiglumis, commonly known as the African rice, is a wild rice species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and robust, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as rice paddies and floodplains, and has adapted to seasonal flooding. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is of significant interest for genetic diversity studies due to its potential contributions to modern rice breeding programs.</p>
