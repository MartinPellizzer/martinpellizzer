                <h1>Oxytheca dendroidea</h1>
<p>Oxytheca dendroidea, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tree-like structure, with a thick, woody trunk and branching stems that bear clusters of spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. Oxytheca dendroidea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections.</p>
