                    <h1>Ouret humbertii</h1>
<p>Ouret humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's ouret, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from shallow soil layers, making it well-suited to its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ouret humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
