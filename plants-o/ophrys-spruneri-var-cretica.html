                    <h1>Ophrys spruneri var. cretica</h1>
<p>Ophrys spruneri var. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats, often in sunny or partially shaded areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
