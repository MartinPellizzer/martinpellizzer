<p>Odontochilus tashiroi, commonly known as the Tashiro's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, creeping rhizome and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive toothed lip that gives the genus its name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in shaded, humid environments within montane forests.</p>
