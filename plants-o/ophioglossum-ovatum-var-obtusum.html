                    <h1>Ophioglossum ovatum var. obtusum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum ovatum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically broad and lanceolate. The plant has a primitive morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, large, lanceolate leaf that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It produces two types of spores—megaspores and microspores—on separate sporophylls, a feature typical of the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
