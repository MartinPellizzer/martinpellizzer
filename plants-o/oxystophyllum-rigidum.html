                    <h1>Oxystophyllum rigidum</h1>
<p>Oxystophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid oxystophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
