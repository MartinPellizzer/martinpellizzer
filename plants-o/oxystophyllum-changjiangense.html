                    <h1>Oxystophyllum changjiangense</h1>
<p>Oxystophyllum changjiangense, commonly known as the Changjiang river fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and lakes, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Oxystophyllum changjiangense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
