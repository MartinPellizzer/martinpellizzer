<p>Oreocarya horridula, commonly known as the rough oreocarya, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Oreocarya horridula plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for small wildlife.</p>
