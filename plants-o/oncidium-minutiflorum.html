                    <h1>Oncidium minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Oncidium minutiflorum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with irregular rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and they absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Oncidium minutiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
