<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>saratoi, commonly known as the Saratov bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are usually yellowish-green with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
