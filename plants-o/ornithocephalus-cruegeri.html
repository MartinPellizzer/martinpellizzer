<p>Ornithocephalus cruegeri, commonly known as the Crueger's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, white or pale pink flowers. Native to the arid regions of South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its stems are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
