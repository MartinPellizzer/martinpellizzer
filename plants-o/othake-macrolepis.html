                    <h1>Othake macrolepis</h1>
<p>Othake macrolepis, commonly known as the large-scale cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, leathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
