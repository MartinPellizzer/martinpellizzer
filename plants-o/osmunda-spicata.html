<p>Osmunda spicata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into large, bipinnate fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central stem that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda spicata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
