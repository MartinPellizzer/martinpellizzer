                    <h1>Oryzopsis duthiei</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
