The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, a typical adaptation for water storage and protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
