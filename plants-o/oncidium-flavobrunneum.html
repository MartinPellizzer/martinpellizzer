                    <h1>Oncidium flavobrunneum</h1>
<p>Oncidium flavobrunneum, commonly known as the golden-brown orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces pendulous inflorescences with fragrant, yellowish-brown flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Oncidium flavobrunneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
