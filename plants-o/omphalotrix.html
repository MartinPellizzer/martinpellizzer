<p>Omphalotrix, commonly known as the ghost cap, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their pale, often ghostly appearance, with caps that range from white to pale yellow or even pinkish in color. They typically grow in grassy areas and are found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. The fruiting bodies are usually small, with a smooth or slightly sticky cap surface and a slender, often curled stem.</p>
<p>Omphalotrix species are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
