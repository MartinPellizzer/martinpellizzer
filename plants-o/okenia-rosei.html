                    <h1>Okenia rosei</h1>
<p>Okenia rosei, commonly known as the rose sea anemone, is a species of cnidarian found in shallow tropical waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pink to red coloration and a central oral disc surrounded by long, slender tentacles. The plant lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, instead relying on its polyp structure for anchoring and feeding. Its tentacles are equipped with nematocysts, specialized cells used for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Okenia rosei plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
