<p>Ophrys × mirandana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>maschioi, commonly known as the Maschio's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that are pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Ophrys genus.</p>
