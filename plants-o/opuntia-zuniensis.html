<p>Opuntia zuniensis, commonly known as the Zuni prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia zuniensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
