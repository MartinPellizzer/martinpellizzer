                    <h1>Orthopogon holciformis</h1>
<p>Orthopogon holciformis, commonly known as the creeping grass or Holcium grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Orthopogon holciformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
