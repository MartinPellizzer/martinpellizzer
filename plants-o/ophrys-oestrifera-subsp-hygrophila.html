<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
