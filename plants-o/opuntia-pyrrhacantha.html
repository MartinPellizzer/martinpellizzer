                    <h1>Opuntia pyrrhacantha</h1>
<p>Opuntia pyrrhacantha, commonly known as the red-pearled prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, red-brown glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia pyrrhacantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
