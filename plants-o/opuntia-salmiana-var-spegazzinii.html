<p>Opuntia salmiana var. spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or processed into jams and beverages. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
