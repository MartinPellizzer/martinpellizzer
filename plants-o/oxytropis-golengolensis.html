<p>Oxytropis golengolensis, commonly known as the Golengol locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by grazing animals, which helps it persist in its harsh environment.</p>
