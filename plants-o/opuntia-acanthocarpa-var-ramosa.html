                    <h1>Opuntia acanthocarpa var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia acanthocarpa var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems bear clusters of small, sharp spines called glochids.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
