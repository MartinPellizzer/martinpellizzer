<p>Osmunda schelpei, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Osmunda schelpei plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
