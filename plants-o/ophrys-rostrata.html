<p>Ophrys rostrata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its intricate flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white, with a distinctive "face" that mimics the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>Ophrys rostrata is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a unique, elongated lip that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
