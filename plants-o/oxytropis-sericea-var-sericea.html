                    <h1>Oxytropis sericea var. sericea</h1>
<p>Oxytropis sericea var. sericea, commonly known as silky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
