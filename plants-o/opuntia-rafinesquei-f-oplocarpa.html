                    <h1>Opuntia rafinesquei f. oplocarpa</h1>
<p>Opuntia rafinesquei f. oplocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spineless stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are modified for photosynthesis, a common adaptation in cacti.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
