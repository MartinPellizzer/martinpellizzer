                    <h1>Opuntia monacanthos</h1>
<p>Opuntia monacanthos, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia monacanthos is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions.</p>
