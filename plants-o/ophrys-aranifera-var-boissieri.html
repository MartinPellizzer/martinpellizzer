                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. boissieri</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lower lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique and ephemeral display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
