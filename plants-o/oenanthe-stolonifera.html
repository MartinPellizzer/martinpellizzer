<p>Oenanthe stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping waterdropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often have a distinctive reddish or purple hue.</p>
<p>Oenanthe stolonifera thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
