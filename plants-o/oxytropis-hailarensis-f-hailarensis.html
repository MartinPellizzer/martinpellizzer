<p>Oxytropis hailarensis f. hailarensis, commonly known as the Hailar oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to the grasslands of northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
