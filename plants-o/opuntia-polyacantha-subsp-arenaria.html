<p>Opuntia polyacantha subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its flat, spine-covered stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior.</p>
<p>The subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
