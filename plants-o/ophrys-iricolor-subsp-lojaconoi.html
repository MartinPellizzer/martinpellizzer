<p>Ophrys iricolor subsp.</p>
<p>lojaconoi, commonly known as the Lojaconoi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it thrives in calcareous soils. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
