                    <h1>Obione pedunculata</h1>
<p>Obione pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has thin, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently capture and digest small organisms such as water fleas and insect larvae.</p>
<p>Obione pedunculata plays an important ecological role in its environment by controlling prey populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
