<p>Orobanche foetida subsp.</p>
<p>broteri, commonly known as the stinking broter's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to its host.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialist herbivore.</p>
