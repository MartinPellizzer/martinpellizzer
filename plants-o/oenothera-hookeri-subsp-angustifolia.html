<p>Oenothera hookeri subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that dehisces to release the seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in arid environments.</p>
