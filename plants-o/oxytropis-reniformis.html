                    <h1>Oxytropis reniformis</h1>
<p>Oxytropis reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its kidney-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Oxytropis reniformis is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
