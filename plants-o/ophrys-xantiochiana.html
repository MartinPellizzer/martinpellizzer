                    <h1>Ophrys xantiochiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys xantiochiana, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique and intricate floral morphology adapted for specific pollination strategies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
