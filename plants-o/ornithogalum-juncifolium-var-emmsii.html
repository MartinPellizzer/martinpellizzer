                    <h1>Ornithogalum juncifolium var. emmsii</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum juncifolium var. emmsii, commonly known as the Emms' threadleaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of star-shaped, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation programs.</p>
