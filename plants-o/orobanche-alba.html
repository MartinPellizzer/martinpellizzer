                    <h1>Orobanche alba</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is considered a weed in many regions due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to manage in agricultural settings.</p>
