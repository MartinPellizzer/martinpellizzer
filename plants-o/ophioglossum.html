                    <h1>Ophioglossum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll. Ophioglossum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. They have a primitive structure, with a single, unbranched stem and a single leaf.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
