                    <h1>Orchis tridentata var. tenoreana</h1>
<p>Orchis tridentata var. tenoreana, commonly known as the Sicilian twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often hairless stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a tall, erect inflorescence bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
