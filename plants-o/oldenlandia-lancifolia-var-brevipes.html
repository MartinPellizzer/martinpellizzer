<p>Oldenlandia lancifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are often followed by bead-like, blue or purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
