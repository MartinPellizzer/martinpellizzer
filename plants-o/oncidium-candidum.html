<p>Oncidium candidum, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Oncidium candidum is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
