                    <h1>Orchis mascula f. longicalcarata</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula f. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-fruited male orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the male orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spurred gynostemium, which is a unique feature in the Orchidaceae family. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats, preferring partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, with a complex structure that facilitates specialized pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions.</p>
