<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
