                    <h1>Ophrys episcopalis var. cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Ophrys episcopalis var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
