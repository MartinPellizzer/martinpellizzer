                    <h1>Orchis tridentata f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis tridentata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking white flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and feature three petals, with the lip being prominently white.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
