<p>Oxytropis triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which can make it an important component of certain ecological systems.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth and potential toxicity to livestock.</p>
