                    <h1>Oligoglossa</h1>
<p>Oligoglossa, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
