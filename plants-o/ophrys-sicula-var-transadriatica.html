                    <h1>Ophrys sicula var. transadriatica</h1>
<p>Ophrys sicula var. transadriatica, commonly known as the Adriatic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short, underground rhizome and produces a single or few erect flowering stems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
