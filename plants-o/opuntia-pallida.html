                    <h1>Opuntia pallida</h1>
<p>Opuntia pallida, commonly known as the pale prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pallida is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
