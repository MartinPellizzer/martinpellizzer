                    <h1>Oedibasis pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Oedibasis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved grasshopperweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to withstand drought make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
