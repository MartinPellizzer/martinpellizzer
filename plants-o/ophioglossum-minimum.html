                    <h1>Ophioglossum minimum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum minimum, commonly known as the little adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are arranged in clusters called sorus. It is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
