                    <h1>Orthophytum</h1>
<p>Orthophytum, commonly known as the silver sword, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to several feet in height, forming a striking, sword-like appearance. These plants are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-draining soil, making them suitable for rock gardens or as container plants.</p>
<p>Orthophytum species produce small, colorful flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant touch to their appearance.</p>
