<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its bulbous stem stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
