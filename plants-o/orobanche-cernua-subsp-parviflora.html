<p>Orobanche cernua subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
