<p>Ototropis elegans subsp.</p>
<p>wolohoensis, commonly known as the Woloho slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomatous growth and specialized root systems for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
