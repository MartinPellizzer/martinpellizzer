<p>Orobanche rapum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish-brown flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbages and mustards. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
