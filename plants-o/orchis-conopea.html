<p>Orchis conopea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid purple and yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Orchis conopea is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
