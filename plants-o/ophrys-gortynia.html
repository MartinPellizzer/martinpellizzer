                    <h1>Ophrys gortynia</h1>
<p>Ophrys gortynia, commonly known as the Gortynium bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys gortynia is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
