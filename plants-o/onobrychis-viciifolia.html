                    <h1>Onobrychis viciifolia</h1>
<p>Onobrychis viciifolia, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Sainfoin also has historical uses in livestock feed and traditional medicine.</p>
