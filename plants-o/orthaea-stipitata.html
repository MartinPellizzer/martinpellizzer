                    <h1>Orthaea stipitata</h1>
<p>Orthaea stipitata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Orthaea stipitata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
