<p>Ophrys × cascalesii, commonly known as the Cascalesii bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its intricate mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Ophrys × cascalesii are closely linked to its specialized pollination strategy, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-animal interactions.</p>
