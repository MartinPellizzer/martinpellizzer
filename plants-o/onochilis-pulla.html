<p>Onochilis pulla, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Onochilis pulla is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and hardy species well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
