<p>Orobanche loricata subsp.</p>
<p>santolinae, commonly known as the Santolina Orobanche, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, often pink or white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, where it attaches to the roots of host species such as Astragalus or Crotalaria. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it forms a haustorium to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
