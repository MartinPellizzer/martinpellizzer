<p>Odontotrichum tridactylitis, commonly known as the three-toed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its morphology includes a compact rosette structure, which helps reduce water loss in its extreme habitat.</p>
