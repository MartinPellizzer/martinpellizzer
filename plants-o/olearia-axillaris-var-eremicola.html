                    <h1>Olearia axillaris var. eremicola</h1>
<p>Olearia axillaris var. eremicola, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and limited water.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
