                    <h1>Ophelia cordata var. laxa</h1>
<p>Ophelia cordata var. laxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>The species is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
