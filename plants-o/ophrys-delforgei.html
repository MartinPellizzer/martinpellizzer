                    <h1>Ophrys delforgei</h1>
<p>Ophrys delforgei, commonly known as the Delforge's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys delforgei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
