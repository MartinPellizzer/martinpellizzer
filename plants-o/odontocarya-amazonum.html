<p>Odontocarya amazonum, commonly known as the Amazonian toothed plant, is a flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins, which give it its common name. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the Amazonian ecosystem.</p>
