<p>Opuntia basilaris subsp.</p>
<p>whitneyana, commonly known as Whitney's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, spine-tipped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has areoles from which both flowers and branches emerge.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions.</p>
