                    <h1>Odontites ruber var. serotinus</h1>
<p>Odontites ruber var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering red toothgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its delayed flowering period and distinct coloration of its foliage.</p>
