<p>Ophrys holosericea psp.</p>
<p>attica, commonly known as the Attic Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
