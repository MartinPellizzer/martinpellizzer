<p>Olea europaea subsp.</p>
<p>guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island olive, is a subspecies of the olive tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, round olives that are edible but not as commonly cultivated for oil production as other olive varieties. It thrives in coastal and volcanic soils, adapting well to the unique climate of the Canary Islands.</p>
