                    <h1>Orobanche alba f. hellebori</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba f. hellebori, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly affect the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions.</p>
