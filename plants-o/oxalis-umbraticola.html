                    <h1>Oxalis umbraticola</h1>
<p>Oxalis umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant native to the understory of shaded forests in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its delicate, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Oxalis umbraticola is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat.</p>
