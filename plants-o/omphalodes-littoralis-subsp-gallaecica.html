<p>Omphalodes littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician coastal bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western coast of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, often in maritime climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and wave action.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
