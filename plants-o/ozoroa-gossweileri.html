<p>Ozoroa gossweileri, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Ozoroa gossweileri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
