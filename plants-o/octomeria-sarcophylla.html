                    <h1>Octomeria sarcophylla</h1>
<p>Octomeria sarcophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often ghostly white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, rounded leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, particularly moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Octomeria sarcophylla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
