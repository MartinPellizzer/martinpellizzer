<p>Oenothera liquida, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Oenothera liquida is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
