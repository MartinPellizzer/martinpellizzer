                    <h1>Orchis doyonensis</h1>
<p>Orchis doyonensis, commonly known as the Doyon's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake. Its habitat is often limited to rocky or alpine environments, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Orchis doyonensis is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
