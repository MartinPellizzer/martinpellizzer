                    <h1>Odontostelma</h1>
<p>Odontostelma, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, white wax-like coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Odontostelma is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
