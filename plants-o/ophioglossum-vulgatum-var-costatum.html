                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. costatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. costatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, sparsely branched rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sporangia along the edges of its fronds. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
