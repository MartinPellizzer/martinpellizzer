                    <h1>Orobanche ramosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche ramosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its highly branched, often yellowish stems. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in disturbed soils or near agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
