                    <h1>Opuntia bensonii</h1>
<p>Opuntia bensonii, commonly known as the Benson prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has areoles from which both flowers and glochids (fine, barbed spines) emerge.</p>
<p>Opuntia bensonii is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food.</p>
