                    <h1>Oryza perennis var. paragayensis</h1>
<p>Oryza perennis var. paragayensis, commonly known as the Paragayean ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>While not a major crop, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical studies for its unique adaptations.</p>
