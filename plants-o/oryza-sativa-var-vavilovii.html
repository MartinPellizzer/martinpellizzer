                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. vavilovii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. vavilovii, commonly known as the wild rice of Central Asia, is a wild variant of rice native to regions such as Kazakhstan and Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and small, elongated grains that differ from the domesticated rice varieties. This species plays a crucial role in rice genetics due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated rice strains. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in flood-prone areas.</p>
<p>Its study contributes to understanding the evolutionary history and adaptation of rice species.</p>
