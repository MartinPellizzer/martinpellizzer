                    <h1>Ophrys × neokelleri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × neokelleri, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). This species is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles the appearance of bees or wasps, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments across Europe, particularly in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its flowers are highly specialized, with a labellum that mimics the body of a female bee, enticing male bees to perform the necessary pollination act.</p>
