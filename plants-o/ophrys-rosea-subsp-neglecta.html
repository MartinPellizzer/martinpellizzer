<p>Ophrys rosea subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which features a complex structure with a lip that resembles a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique pollination mechanism and ecological significance.</p>
