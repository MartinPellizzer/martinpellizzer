                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. bansmatica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. bansmatica, commonly known as the Banska rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, slender grains and high amylose content, which gives it a firm texture when cooked. This variety thrives in cool climates and requires a shorter growing season compared to other rice types. Its cultivation is limited to specific altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at developing climate-resilient rice varieties.</p>
