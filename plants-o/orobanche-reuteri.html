                    <h1>Orobanche reuteri</h1>
<p>Orobanche reuteri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host, such as legumes or other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and productivity of its host plants.</p>
