<p>Ophrestia upembae, commonly known as the Upemba mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Ophrestia upembae plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
