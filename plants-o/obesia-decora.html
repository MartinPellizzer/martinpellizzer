<p>Obesia decora, commonly known as the Decorative Pigmy Date Palm, is a small, ornamental palm native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a short, stout trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible fruits. The plant has feathery, compound leaves that give it a tropical appearance, making it popular in landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
<p>Obesia decora is often used in gardens and as a decorative indoor plant due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal.</p>
