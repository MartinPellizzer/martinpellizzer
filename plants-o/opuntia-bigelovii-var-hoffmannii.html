                    <h1>Opuntia bigelovii var. hoffmannii</h1>
<p>Opuntia bigelovii var. hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
