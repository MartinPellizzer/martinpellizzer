                    <h1>Ophrys × ayusoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × ayusoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees for pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its morphological and genetic diversity, reflecting its complex evolutionary history.</p>
