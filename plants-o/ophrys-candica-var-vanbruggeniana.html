                    <h1>Ophrys candica var. vanbruggeniana</h1>
<p>Ophrys candica var. vanbruggeniana, commonly known as the Van Bruggen's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a crucial role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
