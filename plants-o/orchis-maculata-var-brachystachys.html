                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. brachystachys</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. brachystachys, commonly known as the small-stemded spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple and yellow spotted flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
