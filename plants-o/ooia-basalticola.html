                    <h1>Ooia basalticola</h1>
<p>Ooia basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in volcanic soil environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor basaltic substrates, showcasing its resilience. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Ooia basalticola is often found in association with other endemic species in volcanic regions, making it an important indicator of unique ecological conditions.</p>
