                    <h1>Orchis × schulzei</h1>
<p>Orchis × schulzei, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands across Europe. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its genetic variability and is often found in areas where the parent species overlap.</p>
