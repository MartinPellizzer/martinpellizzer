<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>annae, commonly known as the Annas helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female insects, a trait evolved to attract male pollinators through mimicry.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its often humid environment.</p>
<p>The species is of conservation interest due to habitat loss and its limited distribution.</p>
