<p>Ophrys urteae, commonly known as the Heath Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees.</p>
<p>Ophrys urteae is a protected species in many countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
