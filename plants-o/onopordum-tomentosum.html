<p>Onopordum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Onopordum tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
