<p>Opuntia basilaris var. longiareolata, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly notable for its long, stiff spines and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
