                    <h1>Ononis arthropodia</h1>
<p>Ononis arthropodia, commonly known as the woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard, many-seeded fruits known as achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
