                    <h1>Ophrys aeoli</h1>
<p>Ophrys aeoli, commonly known as the Aeolian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Aeolian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys aeoli is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries.</p>
