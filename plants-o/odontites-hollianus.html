<p>Odontites hollianus, commonly known as the Hollianus toothworts, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique subterranean structure, with its leaves growing underground and only the flowering stems emerging above the soil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontites hollianus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
