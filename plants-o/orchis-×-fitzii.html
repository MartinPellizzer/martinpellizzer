                    <h1>Orchis × fitzii</h1>
<p>Orchis × fitzii, commonly known as the Fitz's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant with a robust rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a spike and have a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and it is native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid and its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
