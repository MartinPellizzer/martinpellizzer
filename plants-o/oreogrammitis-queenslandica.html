                <h1>Oreogrammitis queenslandica</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland wallrubble, is a rare and specialized fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures are small and clustered, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires specific conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
