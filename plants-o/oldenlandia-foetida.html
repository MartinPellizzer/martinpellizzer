<p>Oldenlandia foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in umbels. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor of its flowers, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a means of attracting certain pollinators.</p>
