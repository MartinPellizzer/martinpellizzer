                    <h1>Orobanche nana</h1>
<p>Orobanche nana, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and lack of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found parasitizing species of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
