<p>Orchis lactea var. ennensis, commonly known as the Ennensian milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are often tinged with green or brown, and its unique morphology that reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
