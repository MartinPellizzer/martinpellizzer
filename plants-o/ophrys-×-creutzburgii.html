<p>Ophrys × creutzburgii, commonly known as the creutzburgii bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in various regions of Europe, including Spain, France, and Italy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
