                    <h1>Oligactis apodocephala</h1>
<p>Oligactis apodocephala, commonly known as the naked-headed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, non-showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oligactis apodocephala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
