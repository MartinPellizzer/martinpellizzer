<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>dodekanensis, commonly known as the Dodecanese bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
