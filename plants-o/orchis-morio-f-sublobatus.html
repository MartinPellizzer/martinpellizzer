                    <h1>Orchis morio f. sublobatus</h1>
<p>Orchis morio f. sublobatus, commonly known as the sublobate marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-purple flowers with a prominent lip. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
