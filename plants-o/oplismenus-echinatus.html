                    <h1>Oplismenus echinatus</h1>
<p>Oplismenus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grasses, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or moist soils along stream banks and in swamps.</p>
<p>Oplismenus echinatus is notable for its spiny bracts that protect its flowering structures.</p>
