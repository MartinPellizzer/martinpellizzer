<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
