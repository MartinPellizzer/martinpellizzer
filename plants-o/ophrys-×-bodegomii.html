                    <h1>Ophrys × bodegomii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × bodegomii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee or wasp to attract male pollinators. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions where the parent species overlap geographically. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination strategy and genetic origin, it is of particular interest in the study of orchid evolution and hybridization.</p>
