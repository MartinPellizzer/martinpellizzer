                    <h1>Orobanche ammophila</h1>
<p>Orobanche ammophila, commonly known as the sand hopper or sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically parasitizes grasses and other plants in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal dunes or agricultural fields. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
