                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. atropurpurea, commonly known as purple rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its striking purple to reddish hues in the grains and plant parts.</p>
<p>This coloration is primarily due to the high concentration of anthocyanins, which are pigments with antioxidant properties. It is typically cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, similar to other rice varieties, and requires warm, humid climates with abundant water. The plant has a short growth cycle and is often used in both culinary and ornamental contexts.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for specialty markets and traditional cuisines.</p>
