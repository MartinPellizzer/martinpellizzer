<p>Ophrys sicula var. urteae, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands and rocky habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
