                    <h1>Orobanche javakhetica</h1>
<p>Orobanche javakhetica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. It is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized biology, it plays a role in ecological interactions but is also considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
