                <h1>Opuntia erinacea</h1>
<p>Opuntia erinacea, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia erinacea plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
