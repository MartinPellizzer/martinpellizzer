                    <h1>Opuntia candelabriformis var. rigidior</h1>
<p>Opuntia candelabriformis var. rigidior, commonly known as the rigid prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are covered in glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs that can cause irritation.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry, hot climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
