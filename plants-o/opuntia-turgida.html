<p>Opuntia turgida, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia turgida is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
