<p>Opuntia salicornoides, commonly known as the sea fig or desert cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Opuntia salicornoides is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>
