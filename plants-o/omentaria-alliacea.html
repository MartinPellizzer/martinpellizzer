                    <h1>Omentaria alliacea</h1>
<p>Omentaria alliacea, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots contain sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like odor, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its competitive nature and allelopathic properties.</p>
