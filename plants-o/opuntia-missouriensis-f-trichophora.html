<p>Opuntia missouriensis f. trichophora, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a shallow root system to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its trichophore form, which refers to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its stems.</p>
