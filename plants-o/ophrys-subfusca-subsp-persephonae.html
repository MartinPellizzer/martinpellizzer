<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>persephonae, commonly known as the Persian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
