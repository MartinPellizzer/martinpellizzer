                    <h1>Oreocarya nana</h1>
<p>Oreocarya nana, commonly known as the dwarf oreocarya, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pale green or yellow and appear in late summer.</p>
<p>Oreocarya nana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes.</p>
