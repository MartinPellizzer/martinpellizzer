                    <h1>Ophrys apifera var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera var. bicolor, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure that closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a yellow and brown pattern, and it is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where male bees attempt to mate with the flower, transferring pollen in the process.</p>
