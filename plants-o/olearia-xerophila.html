<p>Olearia xerophila, commonly known as the coastal daisy or silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal environments, characterized by its silver-green foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, a feature typical of xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Olearia xerophila is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
