                    <h1>Ophrys × epidavrensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × epidavrensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys faginea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in the temperate climate of its native range. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapting to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its unique ecological role in pollination.</p>
