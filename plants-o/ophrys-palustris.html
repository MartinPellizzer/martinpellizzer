                    <h1>Ophrys palustris</h1>
<p>Ophrys palustris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
