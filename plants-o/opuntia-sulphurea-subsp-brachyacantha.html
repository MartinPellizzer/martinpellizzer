<p>Opuntia sulphurea subsp.</p>
<p>brachyacantha, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
