                            <h1>Odontorchis Ustulata</h1>
<p>Odontorchis orchid, scientifically known as Odontorchis ustulata, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This orchid is distinguished by its intricate, spurred petals and a unique coloration that ranges from pale pink to deep violet. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest canopies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as endangered by conservation organizations. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination.</p>
