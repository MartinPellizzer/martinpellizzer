                    <h1>Ophioglossum tuberosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum tuberosum, commonly known as the horse tail, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a long, whip-like structure at the end of its stem. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores being released from the sporangia rather than flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
