<p>Oncidium volvox, commonly known as the "golden orchid," is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and slightly wavy. Oncidium volvox is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
