                    <h1>Oreophilus catellus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus catellus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
