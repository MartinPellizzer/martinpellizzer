The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are highly specialized, featuring a labellum that resembles a wasp or bee, enhancing its mimicry for effective pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations.</p>
