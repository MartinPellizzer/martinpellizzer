                    <h1>Ophrys umbilicata var. latakiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys umbilicata var. latakiana, commonly known as the Latakian bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
