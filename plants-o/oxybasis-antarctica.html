                    <h1>Oxybasis antarctica</h1>
<p>Oxybasis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that contain the reproductive structures. It is adapted to survive in harsh, frost-prone environments, often found in Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>Oxybasis antarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microscopic organisms in its extreme habitat.</p>
