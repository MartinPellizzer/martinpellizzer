<p>Onobrychis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bur clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry and nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Onobrychis macrorhiza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality.</p>
