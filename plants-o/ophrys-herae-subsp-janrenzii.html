<p>Ophrys herae subsp.</p>
<p>janrenzii, commonly known as the Janrenz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is typically pale yellow with dark markings. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
