<p>Orchis ustulata lusus integriloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
