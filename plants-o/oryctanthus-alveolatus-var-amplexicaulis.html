                    <h1>Oryctanthus alveolatus var. amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Oryctanthus alveolatus var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the cushion oryx flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing plant with dense clusters of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
