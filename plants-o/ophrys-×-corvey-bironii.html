                    <h1>Ophrys × corvey-bironii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × corvey-bironii, commonly known as the Corvey-Biron bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys lutea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions of Europe, particularly in France and Italy. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies on plant-pollinator interactions.</p>
