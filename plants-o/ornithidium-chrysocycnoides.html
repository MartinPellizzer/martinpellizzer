                    <h1>Ornithidium chrysocycnoides</h1>
<p>Ornithidium chrysocycnoides, commonly known as the golden cycnus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, which reflects its name, and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive cycnus-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid diversity in extreme climates.</p>
