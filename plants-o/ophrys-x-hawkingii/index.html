                            <h1>Ophrys × Hawkingii</h1>
<p>Hawking's ophrys, scientifically known as Ophrys × hawkingii, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the British Isles. This unique plant is named in honor of the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, reflecting a blend of science and nature. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like appearance, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in damp, shaded areas of woodland. Its existence highlights the delicate balance between ecological preservation and human impact.</p>
