<p>Ophrys × celani subsp.</p>
<p>hawkingi, commonly known as the Hawking's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles the female wasp, a key feature in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-pollinated flowers with a complex blend of colors and patterns that mimic the appearance of its pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
