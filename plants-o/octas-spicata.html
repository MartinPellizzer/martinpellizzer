                    <h1>Octas spicata</h1>
<p>Octas spicata, commonly known as the spiky octopus plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, twisted, spiky stems that resemble the tentacles of an octopus, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its architectural form makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
