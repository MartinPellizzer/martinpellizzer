<p>Orchis morio subsp.</p>
<p>longicornu, commonly known as the long-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which plays a crucial role in attracting its specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its life cycle is long, with some individuals taking several years to reach maturity and bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
