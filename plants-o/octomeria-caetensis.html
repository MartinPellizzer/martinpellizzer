                    <h1>Octomeria caetensis</h1>
<p>Octomeria caetensis, commonly known as the Ceara mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the northeastern regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as *Cecropia* and *Erythroxylum*, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Octomeria caetensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicative of specific forest environments in the Atlantic Rainforest.</p>
