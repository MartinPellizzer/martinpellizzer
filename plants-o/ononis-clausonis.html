<p>Ononis clausonis, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It has small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in loose, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ononis clausonis is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
