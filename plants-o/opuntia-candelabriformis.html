<p>Opuntia candelabriformis, commonly known as the candlestick prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia candelabriformis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
