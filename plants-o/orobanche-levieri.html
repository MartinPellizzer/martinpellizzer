<p>Orobanche levieri, commonly known as the Levieri's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale or yellowish in color. It typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
