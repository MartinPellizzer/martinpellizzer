<p>Onobrychis alamutensis, commonly known as the Alamut sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, sparsely hairy pods that contain small, elliptical seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Onobrychis alamutensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
