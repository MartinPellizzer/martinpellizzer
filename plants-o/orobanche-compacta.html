                    <h1>Orobanche compacta</h1>
<p>Orobanche compacta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dormancy for several years. It is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
