<p>Osmundastrum cinnamomeum subsp.</p>
<p>cinnamomeum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has a long, horizontal rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
