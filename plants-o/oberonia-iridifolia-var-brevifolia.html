                    <h1>Oberonia iridifolia var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Oberonia iridifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved iris orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are short and broad, often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This orchid requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
