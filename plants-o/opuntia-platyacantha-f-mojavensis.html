<p>Opuntia platyacantha f. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surfaces and thick, waxy stems for water storage.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary response to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
