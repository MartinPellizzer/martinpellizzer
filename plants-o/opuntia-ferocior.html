<p>Opuntia ferocior, commonly known as the fierce prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife and humans. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia ferocior plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various desert species.</p>
