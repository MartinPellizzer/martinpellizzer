                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue, is a fern-like plant characterized by its unique, primitive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a single, upright sterile frond that is typically lanceolate in shape, with a prominent, tongue-like spore-bearing structure at the base. The plant produces spores in specialized sporangia located on the underside of the frond, a feature typical of primitive ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, offering insights into the evolution of ferns.</p>
