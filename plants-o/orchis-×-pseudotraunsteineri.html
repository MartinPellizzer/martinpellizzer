                    <h1>Orchis × pseudotraunsteineri</h1>
<p>Orchis × pseudotraunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant with tall, erect stems that bear showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are characterized by a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Orchis × pseudotraunsteineri is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that exemplifies the genetic diversity within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
