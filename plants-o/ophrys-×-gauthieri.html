                    <h1>Ophrys × gauthieri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × gauthieri, commonly known as the Gauthier's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Ophrys × gauthieri results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, contributing to its unique botanical features.</p>
