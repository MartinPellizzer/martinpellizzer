                    <h1>Ornithogalum inandense</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum inandense, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and should not be ingested, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum inandense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>
