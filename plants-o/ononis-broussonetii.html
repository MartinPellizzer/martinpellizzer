<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sand scabious plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
