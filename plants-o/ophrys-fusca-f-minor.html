                    <h1>Ophrys fusca f. minor</h1>
<p>Ophrys fusca f. minor, commonly known as the lesser  bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and lack the typical showy petals seen in many orchids.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
