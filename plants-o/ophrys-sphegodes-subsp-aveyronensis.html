<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>aveyronensis, commonly known as the Aveyron bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
