                    <h1>Ophrys × agustinii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × agustinii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is known for its intricate and deceptive floral structures that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait used to attract male pollinators. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
