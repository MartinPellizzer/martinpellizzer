                    <h1>Orchis depsata</h1>
<p>Orchis depsata, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear a cluster of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Orchis depsata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of natural beauty in botanical gardens.</p>
