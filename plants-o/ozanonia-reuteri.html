                    <h1>Ozanonia reuteri</h1>
<p>Ozanonia reuteri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Ozanonia reuteri is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been heavily harvested leading to its decline in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
