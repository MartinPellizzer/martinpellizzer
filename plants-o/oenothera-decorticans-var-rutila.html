<p>Oenothera decorticans var. rutila, commonly known as the "desert evening primrose," is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, a common trait in the Onagraceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates.</p>
