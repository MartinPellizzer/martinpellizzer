                    <h1>Ophrys oestrifera f. bremifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys oestrifera f. bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
