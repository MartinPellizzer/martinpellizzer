<p>Oberonia tenuis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Oberonia tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids.</p>
