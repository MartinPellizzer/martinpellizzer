                    <h1>Orobanche ebuli</h1>
<p>Orobanche ebuli, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem supporting its flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale purple in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop management and ecological studies.</p>
