<p>Opuntia assumptionis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia assumptionis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
