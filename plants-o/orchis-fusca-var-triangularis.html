                    <h1>Orchis fusca var. triangularis</h1>
<p>Orchis fusca var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, strikingly shaped flower that often has a dark purple or brownish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the species is noted for its unique triangular appearance in cross-section.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in certain regions.</p>
