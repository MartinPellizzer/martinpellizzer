<p>Ophrys heldreichii subsp.</p>
<p>schlechteriana, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
