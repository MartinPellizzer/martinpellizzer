                    <h1>Ophioglossum cognatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum cognatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
