<p>Oenothera biennis var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variant differs from the typical Oenothera biennis by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
