<p>Orbeopsis sousae, commonly known as the Socotra starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that resemble the appearance of a starfish. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orbeopsis sousae is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
