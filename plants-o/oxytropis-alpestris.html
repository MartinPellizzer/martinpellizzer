                    <h1>Oxytropis alpestris</h1>
<p>Oxytropis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, oval seeds that are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>Oxytropis alpestris is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps enrich the soil in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
