                    <h1>Ophrys araneola subsp. virescens</h1>
<p>Ophrys araneola subsp.</p>
<p>virescens, commonly known as the green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that closely resemble the shape and color of a wasp, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
