                    <h1>Orchis × semisaccata</h1>
<p>Orchis × semisaccata, commonly known as the intermediate orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis saccata.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, typically found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, with three petals and a distinctive lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Orchis × semisaccata contributes to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
