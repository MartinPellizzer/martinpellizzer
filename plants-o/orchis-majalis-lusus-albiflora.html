<p>Orchis majalis lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers at the top, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
