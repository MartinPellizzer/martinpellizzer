                    <h1>Opuntia nana</h1>
<p>Opuntia nana, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a small cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and short, flattened stems called cladodes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia nana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and minimal water requirements.</p>
