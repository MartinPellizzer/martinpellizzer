                    <h1>Oncidium × cookianum</h1>
<p>Oncidium × cookianum, commonly known as the Cook's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent species, Oncidium flexuosum and Oncidium sanderianum.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure, typical of many Oncidium species, and features a system of aerial roots that help in water absorption. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Oncidium × cookianum is popular among orchid growers for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
