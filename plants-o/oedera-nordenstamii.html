                    <h1>Oedera nordenstamii</h1>
<p>Oedera nordenstamii, commonly known as the Nordenstam's oedera, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its small, ovate leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are critical for the survival of this unique species.</p>
