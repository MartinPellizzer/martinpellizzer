                    <h1>Ornithogalum pendulum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging star of Bethlehem, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that hang downward from its stem. The plant blooms in early to mid-spring, adding a delicate, ethereal beauty to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique appearance and the way it seems to "hang" in the air.</p>
