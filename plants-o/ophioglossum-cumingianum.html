<p>Ophioglossum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically bright yellow or orange. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect, leaf-like structure that is often divided into segments. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
