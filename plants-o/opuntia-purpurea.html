<p>Opuntia purpurea, commonly known as the purple prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of vibrant purple flowers. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia purpurea is also known for its ability to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
