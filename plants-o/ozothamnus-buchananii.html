                    <h1>Ozothamnus buchananii</h1>
<p>Ozothamnus buchananii, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom from spring to autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to sandy and saline soils makes it a common sight in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
<p>Ozothamnus buchananii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
