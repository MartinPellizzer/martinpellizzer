                    <h1>Orobanche strigosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche strigosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
