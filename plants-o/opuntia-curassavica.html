                    <h1>Opuntia curassavica</h1>
<p>Opuntia curassavica, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are adapted for water storage and photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Its spines, or glochids, are a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Opuntia curassavica is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
