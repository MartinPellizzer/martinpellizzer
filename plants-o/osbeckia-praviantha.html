                    <h1>Osbeckia praviantha</h1>
<p>Osbeckia praviantha, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Osbeckia praviantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
