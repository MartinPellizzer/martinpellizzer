This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
