<p>Oenothera boothii subsp.</p>
<p>decorticans, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies decorticans is distinguished by its easily separable seed coats, which facilitate seed dispersal.</p>
