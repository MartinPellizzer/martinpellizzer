                    <h1>Opuntia leptocaulis var. vaginata</h1>
<p>Opuntia leptocaulis var. vaginata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
