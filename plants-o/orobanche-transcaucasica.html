                    <h1>Orobanche transcaucasica</h1>
<p>Orobanche transcaucasica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
