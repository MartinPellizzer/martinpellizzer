                    <h1>Orobus sylvaticus var. simplicifolius</h1>
<p>Orobus sylvaticus var. simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
