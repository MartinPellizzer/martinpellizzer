                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza eryei</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza eryei, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique root system, which includes pneumatophoresâ€”specialized aerial roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Ophiorrhiza eryei thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
