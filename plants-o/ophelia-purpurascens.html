                    <h1>Ophelia purpurascens</h1>
<p>Ophelia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often near streams, ponds, and lakes. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Ophelia purpurascens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
