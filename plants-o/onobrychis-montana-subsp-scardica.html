<p>Onobrychis montana subsp.</p>
<p>scardica, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
