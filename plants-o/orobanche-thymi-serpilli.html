                    <h1>Orobanche thymi-serpilli</h1>
<p>Orobanche thymi-serpilli, commonly known as the serpillum broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. It is often found growing on the roots of plants in the genus Thymus, such as thyme.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
