                    <h1>Ornithogalum spicatum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum spicatum, commonly known as the spike lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a dense spike of white or pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
