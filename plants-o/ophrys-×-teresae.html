                    <h1>Ophrys × teresae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × teresae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying a range of colors from yellow to brown, depending on the specific hybrid.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Ophrys × teresae lies in its role as a model species for studying plant-pollinator co-evolution and hybridization in orchids.</p>
