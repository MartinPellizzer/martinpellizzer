                    <h1>Ocotea arenaria</h1>
<p>Ocotea arenaria, commonly known as the beach ocotea, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
