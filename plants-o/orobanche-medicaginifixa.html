                    <h1>Orobanche medicaginifixa</h1>
<p>Orobanche medicaginifixa, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its highly reduced morphology, with no true leaves or roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It primarily parasitizes legumes, such as Medicago species, by attaching to their roots through specialized haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and potential to reduce crop yields, it is considered an agricultural weed in certain regions.</p>
