                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. nero-vialonica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. nero-vialonica, commonly known as the Black Vialonica Rice, is a unique variety of rice characterized by its deep black grains.</p>
<p>This variety is native to specific regions in Asia and is cultivated for its distinct appearance and potential nutritional properties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 100â€“120 cm, with long, slender leaves and a robust stem. Its flowers are small and green, typical of the grass family, and it produces panicles that bear the characteristic rice grains.</p>
<p>The black coloration of the grains is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which may contribute to its antioxidant properties.</p>
