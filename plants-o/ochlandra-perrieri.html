                    <h1>Ochlandra perrieri</h1>
<p>Ochlandra perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ochlandra perrieri is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
