                    <h1>Ophrys × sommieri</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sommieri, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its floral structure includes a labellum that resembles a bee's abdomen, complete with fine hairs and a raised nectar gland.</p>
<p>This hybrid exhibits genetic diversity and is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
