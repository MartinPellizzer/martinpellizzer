                    <h1>Ophrys × lupiae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lupiae, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Ophrys genus within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys lupinalis (the lion's mouth orchid), resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. It typically grows in calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
<p>This orchid is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a distinctive central "labellum" that plays a key role in its pollination mechanism.</p>
