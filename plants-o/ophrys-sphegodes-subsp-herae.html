<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>herae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a distinctive, elongated lip that plays a key role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>This subspecies is found across parts of Europe and is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
