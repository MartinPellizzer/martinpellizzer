                    <h1>Orobanche panormitana</h1>
<p>Orobanche panormitana, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It typically parasitizes species of the genus Brassica, such as cabbage and mustard.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite.</p>
