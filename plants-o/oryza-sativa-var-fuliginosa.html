                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. fuliginosa, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark pigmentation due to high concentrations of anthocyanins.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The grains are typically smaller and harder than other rice varieties, contributing to its unique texture. It is rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, and essential minerals, making it a healthful addition to diets.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly consumed than white or brown rice due to its distinct flavor and longer cooking time.</p>
