                    <h1>Opuntia eichlamii</h1>
<p>Opuntia eichlamii, commonly known as the Eichler's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red or purple fruits. Opuntia eichlamii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
