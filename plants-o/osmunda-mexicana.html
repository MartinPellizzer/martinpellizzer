<p>Osmunda mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating fronds that are divided into small, delicate pinnae, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Osmunda mexicana plays a role in water filtration and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
