                    <h1>Ophryosporus johnstonii</h1>
<p>Ophryosporus johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's spore plant, is a rare and specialized member of the Ophryosporaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. The plant is adapted to grow in specific, often nutrient-poor environments, such as rocky soils or shaded forest floors. Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on wind pollination, which is crucial for its survival in isolated habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
