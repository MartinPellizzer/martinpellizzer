<p>Ononis reuteri, commonly known as the rock pepper or desert flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Ononis reuteri is well adapted to harsh conditions, showcasing resilience and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
