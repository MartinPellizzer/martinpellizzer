                            <h1>Oenothera Hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Hairy evening primrose, scientifically known as Oenothera hirsutissima, is a striking member of the evening primrose family native to North America. This plant is recognized for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at dusk, adding a unique charm to the night landscape. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name, making it easily identifiable in the wild. With its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
