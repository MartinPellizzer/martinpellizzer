                    <h1>Orobanche versicolor var. macrophyllon</h1>
<p>Orobanche versicolor var. macrophyllon, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with fleshy, scale-like leaves. It typically attaches to the stems of woody plants such as poplars and willows through its haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems but can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
