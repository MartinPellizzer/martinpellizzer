<p>Ophrys arachnites subsp.</p>
<p>arachnitiformis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a spider, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats, often in grasslands or heathlands. Its flowers are predominantly green with brown and yellow markings, mimicking the appearance of a spider to attract male wasps.</p>
<p>This mimicry is an evolutionary adaptation that enhances its reproductive success through deceptive pollination.</p>
