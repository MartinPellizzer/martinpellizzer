                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. fatua</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. fatua, commonly known as wild rice, is a wild variety of rice native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective hull that makes them difficult to process.</p>
<p>While it is a close relative of cultivated rice, it is less productive and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
