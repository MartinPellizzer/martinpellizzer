                    <h1>Orobanche purpurea f. millefolii</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurea f. millefolii, commonly known as the purple witch's butter, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, yellowish to reddish stems and showy, often purple or pink flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agronomically significant.</p>
