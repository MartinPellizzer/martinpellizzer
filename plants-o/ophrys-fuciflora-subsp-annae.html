<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>annae, commonly known as the Annas's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as open woods and rocky areas. Its flowers are predominantly green with brownish markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
