                    <h1>Ophrys andria var. halkionis</h1>
<p>Ophrys andria var. halkionis, commonly known as the Halkionis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Naxos.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats. It blooms in late spring, producing flowers with a complex structure that facilitates specific pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
