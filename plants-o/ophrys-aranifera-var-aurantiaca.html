                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow and orange coloration that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
