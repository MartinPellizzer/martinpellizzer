                    <h1>Ophioglossum namegatae</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum namegatae, commonly known as the Japanese adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often slightly curved fronds that resemble the shape of an adder's tongue. The plant has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
