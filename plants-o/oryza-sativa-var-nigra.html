<p>Oryza sativa var. nigra, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark purple to black grain color due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth.
