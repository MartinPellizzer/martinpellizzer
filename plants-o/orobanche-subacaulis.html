                    <h1>Orobanche subacaulis</h1>
<p>Orobanche subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species within the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed or arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
