                    <h1>Orobanche sanguinea</h1>
<p>Orobanche sanguinea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
