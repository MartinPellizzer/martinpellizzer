                            <h1>Oryza Breviligulata</h1>
<p>Breviligulate rice, scientifically known as Oryza breviligulata, is a lesser-known wild rice species native to Southeast Asia. This grass-like plant is characterized by its short, narrow leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Despite its limited cultivation, it holds potential for genetic diversity in rice breeding programs. Researchers are increasingly studying its unique traits to improve resilience in modern rice varieties.</p>
