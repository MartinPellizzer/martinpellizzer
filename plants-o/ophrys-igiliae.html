                    <h1>Ophrys igiliae</h1>
<p>Ophrys igiliae, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys igiliae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
