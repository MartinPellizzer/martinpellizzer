                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. parjattica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. parjattica, commonly known as the Parjattica rice, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique grain morphology and growth habits, which differ from the more widely grown indica and japonica subspecies. This variety is native to specific regions of South Asia and is adapted to particular climatic conditions. Its botanical features include a slender stalk and a distinct grain structure that may offer potential for specialized agricultural use.</p>
<p>Due to limited research, its genetic diversity and ecological significance remain underexplored.</p>
