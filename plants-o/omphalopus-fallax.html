                    <h1>Omphalopus fallax</h1>
<p>Omphalopus fallax, commonly known as the false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Omphalopus fallax is often mistaken for the stinging nettle due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the irritating hairs found on the true nettle.</p>
