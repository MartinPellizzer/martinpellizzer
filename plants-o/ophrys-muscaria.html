                    <h1>Ophrys muscaria</h1>
<p>Ophrys muscaria, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is typically greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black patch resembling a bee's face. Ophrys muscaria thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and open woodlands, often growing in loose colonies.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated through a specialized mechanism that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for mating.</p>
