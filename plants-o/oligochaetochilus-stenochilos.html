<p>Oligochaetochilus stenochilos, commonly known as the narrow-stalked feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and closely arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in small, translucent cells. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where it forms dense, carpet-like mats. Its reproductive structures, including antheridial and archegonial cushions, are situated on the leafy shoots, facilitating sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Oligochaetochilus stenochilos plays a vital ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
