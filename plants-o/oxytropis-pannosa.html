                    <h1>Oxytropis pannosa</h1>
<p>Oxytropis pannosa, commonly known as the pannonian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Oxytropis pannosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
