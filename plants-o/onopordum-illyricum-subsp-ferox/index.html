                            <h1>Onopordum Illyricum Subsp. Ferox</h1>
<p>Ferox thistle, scientifically known as Onopordum illyricum subsp. ferox, is a striking and often invasive plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its presence highlights the delicate balance between ecological impact and botanical interest.</p>
