<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a spider, a trait evolved to mimic female wasps and attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries.</p>
