                    <h1>Oeosporangium coriaceum</h1>
<p>Oeosporangium coriaceum, commonly known as the leather sporangium, is a unique plant characterized by its thick, leathery sporangia.</p>
<p>This species belongs to the group of plants known as bryophytes, specifically liverworts, and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The sporangia are embedded in a tough, protective layer that aids in the retention of spores. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal in humid conditions, making it a significant component of forest floor ecosystems.</p>
