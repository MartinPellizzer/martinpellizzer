<p>Osmunda superba, commonly known as the royal fern, is a tall, robust fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive circinate vernation, where the young fronds coil tightly before unfurling. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Osmunda superba plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
