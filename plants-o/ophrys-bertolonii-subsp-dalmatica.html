<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black coloration, often marked with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
