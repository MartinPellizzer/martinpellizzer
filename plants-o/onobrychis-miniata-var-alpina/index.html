                            <h1>Onobrychis Miniata Var. Alpina</h1>
<p>Alpine onobrychis, scientifically known as Onobrychis miniata var. alpina, is a rare and hardy plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This low-growing perennial is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in alpine ecosystems. Its distinctive appearance includes small, fern-like leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-yellow flowers. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and remote habitat. The plant holds ecological significance as a food source for specialized insects and a symbol of resilience in harsh climates.</p>
