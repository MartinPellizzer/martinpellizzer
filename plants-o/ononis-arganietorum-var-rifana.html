<p>Ononis arganietorum var. rifana, commonly known as the Rif ononises, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
