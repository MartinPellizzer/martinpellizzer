                    <h1>Oryza denudata</h1>
<p>Oryza denudata, commonly known as the naked rice plant, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, pale brown grains. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are simple, with spikelets bearing three to five florets.</p>
<p>Oryza denudata is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to rice breeding programs.</p>
