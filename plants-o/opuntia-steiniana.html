                    <h1>Opuntia steiniana</h1>
<p>Opuntia steiniana, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, making it a nocturnal bloomer. Its fruit, which is typically red or yellow, contains small, edible seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia steiniana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy coating.</p>
