                    <h1>Orobanche hederae f. stenantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche hederae f. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as ivy or other members of the Araliaceae family. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are reduced and often not visible, as the plant focuses energy on flowering and seed production.</p>
<p>This species is often found in shaded, moist environments where its host plants thrive.</p>
