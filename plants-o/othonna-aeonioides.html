<p>Othonna aeonioides, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Othonna aeonioides is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
