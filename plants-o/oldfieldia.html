                    <h1>Oldfieldia</h1>
<p>Oldfieldia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Oldfieldia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to persist through harsh winter conditions.</p>
