<p>Odontochilus drymoglossifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed toothed tongue fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections along the margins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for sustenance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces tiny, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
