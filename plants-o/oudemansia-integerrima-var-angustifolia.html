                    <h1>Oudemansia integerrima var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Oudemansia integerrima var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing in association with various host plants such as shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
