                    <h1>Ophioglossum sarmentosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum sarmentosum, commonly known as the snake fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading rhizome and its unique, lanceolate leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium, which are clustered in a single terminal structure known as a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is often associated with calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
