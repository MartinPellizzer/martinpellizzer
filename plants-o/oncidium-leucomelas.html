<p>Oncidium leucomelas, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with distinctive green veins.

Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape around the stem.</p>
<p>Oncidium leucomelas is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
