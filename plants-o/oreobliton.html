<p>Oreobliton, commonly known as the mountain blite, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with succulent stems and leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oreobliton species produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique adaptations to harsh environments and their potential ecological roles in desert ecosystems.</p>
