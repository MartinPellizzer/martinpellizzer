<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
