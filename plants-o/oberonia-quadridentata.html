<p>Oberonia quadridentata, commonly known as the four-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Oberonia quadridentata is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
