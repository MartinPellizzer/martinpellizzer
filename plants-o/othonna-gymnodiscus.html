<p>Othonna gymnodiscus, commonly known as the smooth disk othonna, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Othonna gymnodiscus is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
