<p>Ophiorrhiza yingtakensis, commonly known as the Yingtank hill banyan, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its fibrous root system and clustered growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophiorrhiza yingtakensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
