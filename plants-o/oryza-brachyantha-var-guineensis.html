                    <h1>Oryza brachyantha var. guineensis</h1>
<p>Oryza brachyantha var. guineensis, commonly known as Guinea rice, is a wild rice species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is a short-lived perennial grass that typically grows in wetland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, often floating on water, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is of interest for its potential in rice breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
