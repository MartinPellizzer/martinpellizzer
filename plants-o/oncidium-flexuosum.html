<p>Oncidium flexuosum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear clusters of bright yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light.</p>
<p>Oncidium flexuosum is popular among orchid growers for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
