                    <h1>Orchis aristata var. immaculata</h1>
<p>Orchis aristata var. immaculata, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, white or pale pink flower that emerges from a short stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its lack of the typical greenish or brownish markings found on the flowers of other orchis species.</p>
