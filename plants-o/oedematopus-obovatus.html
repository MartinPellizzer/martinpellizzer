<p>Oedematopus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, wheel-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Oedematopus obovatus is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in riverine areas and grasslands.</p>
