                    <h1>Oxyspora ovata</h1>
<p>Oxyspora ovata, commonly known as the oval bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually scale-like and reduced, with the main photosynthetic structures being the vesicles.</p>
<p>Oxyspora ovata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
