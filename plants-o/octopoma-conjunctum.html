<p>Octopoma conjunctum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are simple and often clustered around the base of the plant, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Octopoma conjunctum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates.</p>
