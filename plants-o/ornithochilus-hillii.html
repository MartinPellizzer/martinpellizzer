                    <h1>Ornithochilus hillii</h1>
<p>Ornithochilus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's bird's beak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble a bird's beak. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, adding a delicate touch to the forest flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
