                    <h1>Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate chimborazo orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hair. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. This variant is closely related to other species within the Orthrosanthus genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
