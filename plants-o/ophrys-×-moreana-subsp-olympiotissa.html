<p>Ophrys × moreana subsp.</p>
<p>olympiotissa, commonly known as the Olympic orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, thriving in the cool, moist environments of the Greek islands. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white hues, with a distinct three-lobed lip that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited geographic distribution.</p>
