<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>zonata, commonly known as the Zoned Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with distinctive dark markings, aiding in the mimicry that attracts male bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
