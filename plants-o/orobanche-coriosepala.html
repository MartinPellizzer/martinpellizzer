                    <h1>Orobanche coriosepala</h1>
<p>Orobanche coriosepala, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological and agricultural impacts on its host plants.</p>
