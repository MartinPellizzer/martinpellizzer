<p>Omalocline pygmaea var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The varietal name "granatensis" refers to its origin in the Granada region of Spain, where it is a rare and endemic species.</p>
