<p>Oberonia ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap√© orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark violet or purple lip, which is typical of the Oberonia genus. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
