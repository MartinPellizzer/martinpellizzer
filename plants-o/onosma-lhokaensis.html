<p>Onosma lhokaensis, commonly known as the Lhoka sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with woolly, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>
