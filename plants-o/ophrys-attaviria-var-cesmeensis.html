<p>Ophrys attaviria var. cesmeensis, commonly known as the Cesme Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
