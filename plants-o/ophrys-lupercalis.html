<p>Ophrys lupercalis, commonly known as the Mars orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys lupercalis is a protected species in several European countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
