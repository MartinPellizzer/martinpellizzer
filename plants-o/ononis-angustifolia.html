<p>Ononis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ononis angustifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
