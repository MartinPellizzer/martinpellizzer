<p>Ochna sapinii, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ochna sapinii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
