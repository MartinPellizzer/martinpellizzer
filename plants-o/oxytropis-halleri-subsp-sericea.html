<p>Oxytropis halleri subsp.</p>
<p>sericea, commonly known as silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
