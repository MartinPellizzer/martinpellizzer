                    <h1>Orthosporum ambrosioides</h1>
<p>Orthosporum ambrosioides, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its latex sap contains urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, thickets, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and is commonly found along trails and in forest edges.</p>
