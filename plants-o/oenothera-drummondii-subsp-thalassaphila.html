<p>Oenothera drummondii subsp.</p>
<p>thalassaphila, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dune environments and supporting local insect populations.</p>
