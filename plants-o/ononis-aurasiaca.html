<p>Ononis aurasiaca, commonly known as the aurasiac sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ononis aurasiaca is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
