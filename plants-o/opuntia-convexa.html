<p>Opuntia convexa, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunah, is edible and contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia convexa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny exterior.</p>
