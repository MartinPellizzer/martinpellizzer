<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>battandieri, commonly known as the Battandieri's bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower shape, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
