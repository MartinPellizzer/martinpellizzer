<p>Orchis × penzigiana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees, and its floral structure is adapted to facilitate this interaction.</p>
