                    <h1>Orchis sambucina lusus incarnata</h1>
<p>Orchis sambucina lusus incarnata, commonly known as the Pink Butterfly Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a purple or violet tinge. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments with rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
