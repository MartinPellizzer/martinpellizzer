<p>Orchis incarnata var. rhombeilabia-cruenta, commonly known as the crimson spotted orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the showy orchis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers with dark red spots, which are often more pronounced in this variety. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, preferring rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are upright and bear the showy floral spikes.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution.</p>
