<p>Ophrys ciliciana, commonly known as the Cilician bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys ciliciana is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its limited distribution and conservation concerns.</p>
