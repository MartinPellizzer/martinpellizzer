                    <h1>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. parnassica</h1>
<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
