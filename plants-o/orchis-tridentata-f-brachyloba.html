<p>Orchis tridentata f. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-lobed twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a short, stout stem and reduced leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
