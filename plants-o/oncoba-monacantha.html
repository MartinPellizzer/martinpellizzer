<p>Oncoba monacantha, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, plump fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor tidal soils. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncoba monacantha plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
