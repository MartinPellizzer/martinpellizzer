                    <h1>Oreomyrrhis andicola var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Oreomyrrhis andicola var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Andean woolly orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
