                    <h1>Oryza latifolia var. collina</h1>
<p>Oryza latifolia var. collina, commonly known as the broadleaf ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
