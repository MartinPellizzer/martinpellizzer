                    <h1>Oreodoxa praemorsa</h1>
<p>Oreodoxa praemorsa, commonly known as the death orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often pale or white flowers with a distinct, almost skeletal appearance. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers bloom only briefly, typically during the winter months, and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreodoxa praemorsa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
