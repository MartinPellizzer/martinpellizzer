                    <h1>Opuntia sarca</h1>
<p>Opuntia sarca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, green pads covered in spines and small, globose flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water. Opuntia sarca produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert ecosystems.</p>
