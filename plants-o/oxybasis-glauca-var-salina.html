                    <h1>Oxybasis glauca var. salina</h1>
<p>Oxybasis glauca var. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and is adapted to saline and alkaline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in dense mats or tufts, forming a low-growing vegetation that stabilizes dunes and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Saltgrass plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
