<p>Orthochilus nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green leaves and striking purple and white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Orthochilus nigricans is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
