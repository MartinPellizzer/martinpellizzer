<p>Oncidium metallicum, commonly known as the metallic orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, metallic green and yellow floral spikes that resemble metallic sheen. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, with three to five blooms per spike, and they emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Oncidium metallicum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
