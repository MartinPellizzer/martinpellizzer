<p>Oleiocarpon panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like thallus that typically grows in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a central axis and lateral branches, which are covered in small, chlorophyll-rich cells. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Oleiocarpon panamense is often found attached to rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
