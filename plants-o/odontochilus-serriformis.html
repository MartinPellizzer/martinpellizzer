<p>Odontochilus serriformis, commonly known as the serrated toothed orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like projections on its leaves and a delicate, fragrant flower with a distinctive serrated lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
