                    <h1>Opuntia calva</h1>
<p>Opuntia calva, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia calva is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
