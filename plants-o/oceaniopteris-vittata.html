                    <h1>Oceaniopteris vittata</h1>
<p>Oceaniopteris vittata, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue along the veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the ocean, where it can access the moisture-rich air and nutrient-laden soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along rocky shores and sandy beaches.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance in horticulture.</p>
