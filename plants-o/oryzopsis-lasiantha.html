<p>Oryzopsis lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis lasiantha is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
