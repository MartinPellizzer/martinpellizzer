                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites f. cornuta</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites f. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
