<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>convexa, commonly known as the Iron Horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowers have a unique structure with a prominent, hood-like lip that mimics the appearance of a male bee.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
