                    <h1>Orthophytum piranianum</h1>
<p>Orthophytum piranianum, commonly known as the Piranha Cactus, is a unique species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of cacti. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>Orthophytum piranianum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive form and resilience.</p>
