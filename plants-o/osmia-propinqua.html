                    <h1>Osmia propinqua</h1>
<p>Osmia propinqua, commonly known as the eastern squash bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is primarily associated with plants in the Cucurbitaceae family, such as squash and pumpkin, and plays a crucial role in their pollination. The female bee constructs its nest in the soil, lining the cells with a mixture of plant resins and secretions. Osmia propinqua is characterized by its dark, robust body and is often seen visiting flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology and foraging behavior make it an important pollinator for both wild and cultivated plants.</p>
