                    <h1>Ochropteris</h1>
<p>Ochropteris, commonly known as the green fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, once-pinnate fronds that are typically green and leathery in texture. Ochropteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
