<p>Ophrys × mirandana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>coletteae, commonly known as the Colette's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its strikingly intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, showcasing the adaptive strategies of orchids in pollination.</p>
