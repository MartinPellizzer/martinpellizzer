<p>It is characterized by its unique yellow and green floral structure, which is adapted to specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
