                    <h1>Ophrys ficalhoana var. davei</h1>
<p>Ophrys ficalhoana var. davei, commonly known as the Dave's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Madeira.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, intricate pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
