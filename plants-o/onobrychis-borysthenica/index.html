                            <h1>Onobrychis Borysthenica</h1>
<p>Onobrychis borysthenica is a rare and fascinating legume native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. This plant is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves make it easily identifiable. Despite its beauty, it remains under-studied and is often overlooked in botanical research.</p>
