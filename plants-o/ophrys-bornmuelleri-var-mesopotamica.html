<p>Ophrys bornmuelleri var. mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
