                    <h1>Orthosia arenosa</h1>
<p>Orthosia arenosa, commonly known as the sand larkspur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Orthosia arenosa is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
