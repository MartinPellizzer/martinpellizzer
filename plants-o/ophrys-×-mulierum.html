                    <h1>Ophrys × mulierum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mulierum, commonly known as the "female bee orchid," is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers produce nectar, which attracts male bees that attempt to mate with the flower, inadvertently transferring pollen.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation highlights the plant's sophisticated evolutionary strategy for pollination.</p>
