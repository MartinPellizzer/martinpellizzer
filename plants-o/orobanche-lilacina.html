                    <h1>Orobanche lilacina</h1>
<p>Orobanche lilacina, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale purple to lilac-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a connection for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
