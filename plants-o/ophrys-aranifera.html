                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-mimicking flower that resembles a spider, with a hairy, brownish-green spur. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudostigma.</p>
<p>Ophrys aranifera is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
