                    <h1>Ophioglossum lancifolium</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum lancifolium, commonly known as the snake fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, resembling a snake's head. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a terminal, fleshy structure called a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
