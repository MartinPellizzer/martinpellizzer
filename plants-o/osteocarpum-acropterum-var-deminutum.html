<p>Osteocarpum acropterum var. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and gravelly habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for alpine and Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
