<p>Ononis angustissima subsp.</p>
<p>paralias, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant has small, linear leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize loose, nutrient-poor soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the Ononis genus.</p>
