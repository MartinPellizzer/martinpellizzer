<p>Ophiorrhiza thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is typically found growing on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red or orange berries that are often dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and specialized structures for attachment to hosts.</p>
