<p>Opuntia spinosior var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed pads and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
