<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its fruit is a persistent, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Onobroma persicum is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
