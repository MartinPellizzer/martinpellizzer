                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. praecox</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in meadows or grasslands. Its flowering period occurs earlier than the main species, hence the subspecies name "praecox," meaning "early.".</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
