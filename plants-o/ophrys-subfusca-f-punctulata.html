<p>Ophrys subfusca f. punctulata, commonly known as the spotted bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>

The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually a combination of brown and yellow with distinctive markings.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and climatic conditions.</p>
