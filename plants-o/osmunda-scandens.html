<p>Osmunda scandens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a central stem with spreading branches, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. Osmunda scandens produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
