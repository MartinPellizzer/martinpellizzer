                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. taurica</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Crimea and the northern Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
