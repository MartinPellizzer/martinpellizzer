<p>Orobanche boninsimae, commonly known as the Bonin broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Bonin Islands in Japan. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, capable of photosynthesis to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
