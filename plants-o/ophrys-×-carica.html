                    <h1>Ophrys × carica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × carica, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and brown pattern on the lip, which mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Ophrys × carica make it a fascinating subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
