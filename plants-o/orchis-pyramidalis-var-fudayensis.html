                    <h1>Orchis pyramidalis var. fudayensis</h1>
<p>Orchis pyramidalis var. fudayensis, commonly known as the Fuday's pyramidal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal flower spike, which bears multiple small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Its morphology includes lance-shaped leaves and a slender stem, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
