<p>Ornithocephalus aurorae, commonly known as the Dawn's Head, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft blue glow during twilight hours. The plant possesses a unique floral structure with elongated, tubular petals that resemble the beak of a bird, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid mountain environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Ornithocephalus aurorae is considered a conservation priority.</p>
