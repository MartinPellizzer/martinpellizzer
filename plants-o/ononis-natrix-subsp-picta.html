<p>Ononis natrix subsp.</p>
<p>picta, commonly known as the painted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its name "picta" refers to the intricate patterns on its leaves, which resemble painted designs.</p>
