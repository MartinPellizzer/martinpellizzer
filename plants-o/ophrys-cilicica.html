                    <h1>Ophrys cilicica</h1>
<p>Ophrys cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys cilicica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
