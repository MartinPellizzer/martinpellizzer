                    <h1>Orobanche robbinsii</h1>
<p>Orobanche robbinsii, commonly known as the Robbins' broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in the southwestern United States. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host, such as various grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an important indicator of certain ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized relationships and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
