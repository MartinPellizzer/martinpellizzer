                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. limnicola</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. limnicola, commonly known as the aquatic rice, is a variant of rice adapted to grow in waterlogged environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged or semi-submerged growth habit, which allows it to thrive in marshy or flooded areas. The plant has elongated, slender leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into grains. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, compact stem.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in sustainable rice cultivation in wetland ecosystems.</p>
