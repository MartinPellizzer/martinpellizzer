                    <h1>Oxystophyllum tropidoneuron</h1>
<p>Oxystophyllum tropidoneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and narrow in shape. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
