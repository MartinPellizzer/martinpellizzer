<p>Ophiorrhiza tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or vine, attaching itself to host trees through its haustoria to obtain water and nutrients. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its small white flowers are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can remain viable for extended periods, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
