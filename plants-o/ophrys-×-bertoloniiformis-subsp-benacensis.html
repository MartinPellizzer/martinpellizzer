<p>Ophrys × bertoloniiformis subsp.</p>
<p>benacensis, commonly known as the Benacense Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a mix of yellow and brown hues that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
