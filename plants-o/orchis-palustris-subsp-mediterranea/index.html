                            <h1>Orchis Palustris Subsp. Mediterranea</h1>
<p>Common marsh orchid, scientifically known as Orchis palustris subsp. mediterranea, is a striking member of the orchid family found in wetland habitats across southern Europe. This perennial plant is notable for its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
