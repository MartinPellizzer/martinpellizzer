                    <h1>Opuntia elongata</h1>
<p>Opuntia elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are covered in clusters of small, spiny pads called areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia elongata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
