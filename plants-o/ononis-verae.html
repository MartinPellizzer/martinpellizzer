                    <h1>Ononis verae</h1>
<p>Ononis verae, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, hairy stems that rise from a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Ononis verae is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands, and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought-tolerant nature make it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
