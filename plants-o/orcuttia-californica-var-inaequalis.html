                    <h1>Orcuttia californica var. inaequalis</h1>
<p>Orcuttia californica var. inaequalis, commonly known as the San Diego cordgrass, is a rare endemic plant found primarily in the coastal sage scrub habitats of Southern California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
