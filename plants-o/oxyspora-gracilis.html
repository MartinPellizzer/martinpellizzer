                    <h1>Oxyspora gracilis</h1>
<p>Oxyspora gracilis, commonly known as the slender spore moss, is a small, delicate moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, elongated spore capsules that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Oxyspora gracilis is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a common indicator species in moist microhabitats.</p>
