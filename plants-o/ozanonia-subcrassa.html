                    <h1>Ozanonia subcrassa</h1>
<p>Ozanonia subcrassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ozanonia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Ozanonia subcrassa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
