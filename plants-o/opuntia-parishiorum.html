<p>Opuntia parishiorum, commonly known as the Parish's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia parishiorum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
