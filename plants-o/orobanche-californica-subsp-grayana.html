<p>Orobanche californica subsp.</p>
<p>grayana, commonly known as the Gray's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to California. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
