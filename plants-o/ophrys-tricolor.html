                    <h1>Ophrys tricolor</h1>
<p>Ophrys tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, three-toned flowers that range from yellow to green and brown, mimicking the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ophrys tricolor is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
