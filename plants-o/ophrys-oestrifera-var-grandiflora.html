<p>Ophrys oestrifera var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Large-flowered Bee Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a vivid yellow and brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces showy, downward-facing flowers with a distinctive, hairy lip that plays a crucial role in pollination by attracting male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the male bees attempt to mate with the flower, inadvertently transferring pollen.</p>
