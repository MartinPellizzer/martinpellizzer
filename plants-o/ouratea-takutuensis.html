<p>Ouratea takutuensis, commonly known as the Takutu ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Guyana and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
