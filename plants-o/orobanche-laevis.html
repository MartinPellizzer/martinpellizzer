                    <h1>Orobanche laevis</h1>
<p>Orobanche laevis, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often arranged in a spike-like structure. It is commonly found in dry, disturbed habitats and is known to parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
