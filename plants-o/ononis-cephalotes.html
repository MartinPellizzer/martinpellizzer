The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Ononis cephalotes is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing loose soil.</p>
