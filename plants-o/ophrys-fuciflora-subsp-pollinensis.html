<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollinens Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a phenomenon known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces dark brown, hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves, adapted to its harsh, cold environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry of insect forms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
