<p>Onocleopsis hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's onoclea, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its unique fronds with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it has a short growing season, making it difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
