                    <h1>Orobanche cernua f. hansii</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua f. hansii, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the growth of its host plants.</p>
