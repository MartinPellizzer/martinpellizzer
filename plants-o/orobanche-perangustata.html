                    <h1>Orobanche perangustata</h1>
<p>Orobanche perangustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves, and produces small, tubular flowers that attract insects for pollination. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the roots of host plants to extract nutrients.</p>
