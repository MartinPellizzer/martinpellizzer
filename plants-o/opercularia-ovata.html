The lichen typically exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with a smooth and uniform appearance. It is often found in temperate regions, growing on shaded, moist substrates.</p>
<p>Opercularia ovata is notable for its simple morphology and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental conditions.</p>
