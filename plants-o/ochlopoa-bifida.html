<p>Ochlopoa bifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in the early morning. Ochlopoa bifida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
