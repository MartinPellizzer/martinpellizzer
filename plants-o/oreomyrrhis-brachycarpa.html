                    <h1>Oreomyrrhis brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Oreomyrrhis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited myrrhplant, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds. Oreomyrrhis brachycarpa thrives in sandy soils and is often found in maritime chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
