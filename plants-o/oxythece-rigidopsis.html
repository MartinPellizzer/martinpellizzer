                    <h1>Oxythece rigidopsis</h1>
<p>Oxythece rigidopsis, commonly known as the rigid stalked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic prey. Native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia, it thrives in still or slow-moving waters. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its bladders and leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
