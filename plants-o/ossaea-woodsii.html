                    <h1>Ossaea woodsii</h1>
<p>Ossaea woodsii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Ossaea woodsii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
