                    <h1>Orchis hyperborea var. huronensis</h1>
<p>Orchis hyperborea var. huronensis, commonly known as the Huron Mountain Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in open, shaded habitats such as bogs and forest edges. Its survival depends on specific ecological conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
