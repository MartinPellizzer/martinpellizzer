                    <h1>Orobanche arcuata</h1>
<p>Orobanche arcuata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has a taproot system that anchors it to its host. Orobanche arcuata is often found growing on the roots of agricultural crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it a significant weed in farming systems, as it can reduce crop yields and complicate weed management strategies.</p>
