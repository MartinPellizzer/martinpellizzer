                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, paddle-like stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly resilient to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
