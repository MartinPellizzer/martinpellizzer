<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
