<p>Oenanthe globulosa subsp.</p>
<p>olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense globular waterdropwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its subspecific name, *olbiensis*, refers to its geographic distribution in the Olbi region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited populations.</p>
