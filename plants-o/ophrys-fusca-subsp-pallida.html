<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>pallida, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
