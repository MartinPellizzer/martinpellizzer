                    <h1>Orobanche caryophyllacea var. ligustri</h1>
<p>Orobanche caryophyllacea var. ligustri, commonly known as the common yellow broom.</p>
<p>This parasitic plant belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically attaches to the roots of leguminous plants, such as vetch and clover, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are often arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings.</p>
