<p>Oeceoclades alismatophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with consistently moist soil, often found in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
