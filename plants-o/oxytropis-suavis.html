<p>Oxytropis suavis, commonly known as sweet lupin, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Oxytropis suavis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native habitat.</p>
