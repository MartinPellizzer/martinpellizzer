                    <h1>Oxytropis tuberculata</h1>
<p>Oxytropis tuberculata, commonly known as the rough locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its invasive potential.</p>
