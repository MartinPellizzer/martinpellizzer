                    <h1>Oligosporus orophilus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus orophilus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are often pale purple or white, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligosporus orophilus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
