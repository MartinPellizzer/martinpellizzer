                            <h1>Oenothera Rubicunda</h1>
<p>Fireweed, scientifically known as Oenothera rubicunda, is a striking plant that thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. With its vibrant pink to reddish-purple flowers, it often blooms in late summer and early fall, adding color to the landscape. Native to North America, it is commonly found in areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. Despite its common name, fireweed is not related to fire but is often one of the first plants to colonize areas after a fire or disturbance. This resilient plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and restoring ecological balance.</p>
