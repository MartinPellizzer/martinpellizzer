<p>Omphalobium obliquum, commonly known as the slender serrated burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rootstock with numerous upright stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, hairy pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Omphalobium obliquum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in pasture improvement.</p>
