                            <h1>Oreogrammitis Queenslandica</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis queenslandica is a rare and distinctive fern native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia. This species belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, known for its delicate and intricate leaf structures. Its unique morphology includes narrow, lance-shaped fronds that often curl tightly around tree trunks and branches. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Oreogrammitis queenslandica is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
