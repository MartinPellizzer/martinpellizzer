                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. praecox</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>It features a single, strikingly colored flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowering period occurs earlier than the typical bee orchid, usually in late spring, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
