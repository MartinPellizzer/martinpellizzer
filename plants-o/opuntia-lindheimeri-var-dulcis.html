<p>Opuntia lindheimeri var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in small, hair-like spines known as glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits called tunas. Its leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
