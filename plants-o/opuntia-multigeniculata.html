<p>Opuntia multigeniculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed prickly pear, is a cacti species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and areoles, which are specialized structures for housing the plant's flowers and branches. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia multigeniculata is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
