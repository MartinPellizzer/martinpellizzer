<p>Oncidium orthostatoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces pendulous racemes of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Oncidium orthostatoides is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
