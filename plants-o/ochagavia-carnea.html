                    <h1>Ochagavia carnea</h1>
<p>Ochagavia carnea, commonly known as the red-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure composed of cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spine-tipped areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Ochagavia carnea is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
