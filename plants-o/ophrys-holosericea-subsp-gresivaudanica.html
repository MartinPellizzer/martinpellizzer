<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>gresivaudanica, commonly known as the Gresivaudan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single bloom, which is highly adapted for pollination by male bees through mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
