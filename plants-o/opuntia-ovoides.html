                    <h1>Opuntia ovoides</h1>
<p>Opuntia ovoides, commonly known as the football cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ovoides is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
