                    <h1>Orobanche cervarihaerens</h1>
<p>Orobanche cervarihaerens, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host, such as legumes or grasses. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
