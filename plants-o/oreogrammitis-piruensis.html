                    <h1>Oreogrammitis piruensis</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis piruensis, commonly known as the Piru wall-rush, is a rare and endemic fern found primarily in the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats where it forms dense mats on cliffs and talus slopes. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis piruensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
