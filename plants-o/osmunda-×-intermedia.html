                    <h1>Osmunda × intermedia</h1>
<p>Osmunda × intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Osmunda regalis and Osmunda claytonii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a continuous line.</p>
<p>Osmunda × intermedia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
