                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. granatensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granate Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>This orchid is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a showy, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
