                    <h1>Orobanche cruenta var. citrina</h1>
<p>Orobanche cruenta var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in regions with temperate climates. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, often in the presence of specific root exudates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops and is considered a weed in some areas.</p>
