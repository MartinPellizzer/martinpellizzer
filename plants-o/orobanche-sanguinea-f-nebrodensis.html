<p>Orobanche sanguinea f. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden red broom.</p>
<p>This parasitic plant belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers, often in clusters, and has a short, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Its specialized root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
