                    <h1>Opuntia tuna var. manse</h1>
<p>Opuntia tuna var. manse, commonly known as the manse prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
