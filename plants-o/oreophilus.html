                    <h1>Oreophilus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and alpine meadows. Oreophilus species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers, which come in a variety of colors including white, purple, and pink. The plants have specialized root systems that allow them to absorb nutrients from poor soil conditions, a key adaptation to their harsh habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their specific ecological requirements, many Oreophilus species are considered rare or endangered.</p>
