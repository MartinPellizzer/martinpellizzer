                    <h1>Ornithocephalus pottsiae</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus pottsiae, commonly known as the Potts's ornithocephalus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bird-like floral structure, which gives it its genus name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate petal arrangements that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
