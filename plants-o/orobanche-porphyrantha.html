                    <h1>Orobanche porphyrantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche porphyrantha, commonly known as the purplestem broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
