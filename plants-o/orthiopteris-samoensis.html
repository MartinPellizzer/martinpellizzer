<p>Orthiopteris samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are compound, with small, serrated leaflets that help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis.</p>
