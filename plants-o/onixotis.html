                    <h1>Onixotis</h1>
<p>Onixotis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers and its ability to thrive in specific, often difficult-to-reach habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Onixotis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
