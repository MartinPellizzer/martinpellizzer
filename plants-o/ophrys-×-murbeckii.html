<p>Ophrys × murbeckii, commonly known as the Murbeck's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in temperate regions of Europe. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination through mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × murbeckii is a short-lived perennial, often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
