<p>Oldenlandia commutata, commonly known as the common spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
