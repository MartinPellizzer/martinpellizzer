                    <h1>Orobanche arpica</h1>
<p>Orobanche arpica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetch and clover, by attaching to their roots with specialized structures called haustoria. Orobanche arpica is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host plants, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
