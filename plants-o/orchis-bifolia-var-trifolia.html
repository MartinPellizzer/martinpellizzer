<p>Orchis bifolia var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique variant of the common orchis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical two-lobed leaves of its parent species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
