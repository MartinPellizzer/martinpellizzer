                    <h1>Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. gracillimum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups of three. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
