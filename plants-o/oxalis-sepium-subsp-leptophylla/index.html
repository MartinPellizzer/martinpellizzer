                            <h1>Oxalis Sepium Subsp. Leptophylla</h1>
<p>Wood sorrel, scientifically known as Oxalis sepium subsp. leptophylla, is a delicate flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Despite its beauty, it contains oxalic acid, making it potentially toxic if ingested in large quantities. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
