                    <h1>Orchis pseudoconopsea</h1>
<p>Orchis pseudoconopsea, commonly known as the false bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow lower lip and a greenish-blue upper lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom from June to August, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern in many regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
