                    <h1>Octarrhena pusilla</h1>
<p>Octarrhena pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tamarisk, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Octarrhena pusilla is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
