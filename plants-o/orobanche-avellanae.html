                    <h1>Orobanche avellanae</h1>
<p>Orobanche avellanae, commonly known as the hazelnut broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions where its host, such as the hazelnut tree, is present. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, stout stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plant.</p>
