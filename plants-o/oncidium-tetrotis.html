<p>Oncidium tetrotis, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium tetrotis requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive.</p>
