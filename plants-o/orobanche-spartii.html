                    <h1>Orobanche spartii</h1>
<p>Orobanche spartii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
