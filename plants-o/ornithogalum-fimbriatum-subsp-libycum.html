<p>Ornithogalum fimbriatum subsp.</p>
<p>libycum, commonly known as the Libyan star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers with a star-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other subspecies of *Ornithogalum fimbriatum*.</p>
