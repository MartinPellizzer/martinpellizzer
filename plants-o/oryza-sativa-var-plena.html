                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. plena</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. plena, commonly known as the Japanese rice flower or the full-flowered rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its ornamental, rather than culinary, use.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Asia and is cultivated for its showy, plump grains that resemble small, rounded flowers. The inflorescences are densely packed and often display a striking white or pinkish hue, making it a popular ornamental plant. Unlike typical rice varieties, it does not produce edible grain but is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a slender stem, lanceolate leaves, and a compact panicle structure.</p>
