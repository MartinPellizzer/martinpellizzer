<p>Orchis incarnata lusus pulchella, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often spotted with purple or brown. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies.</p>
<p>The showy orchis is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
