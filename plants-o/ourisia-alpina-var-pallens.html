                    <h1>Ourisia alpina var. pallens</h1>
<p>Ourisia alpina var. pallens, commonly known as the pale alpine ourisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrowly elliptic and covered with a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Ourisia alpina.</p>
