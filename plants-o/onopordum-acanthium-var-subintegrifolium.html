<p>Onopordum acanthium var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking purple to pink composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a subintegrifolium leaf structure, meaning the margins are nearly entire with only minor teeth.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
