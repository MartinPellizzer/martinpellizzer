                    <h1>Ochroma pyramidale</h1>
<p>Ochroma pyramidale, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a fast-growing tropical hardwood native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lightweight, porous wood, which is among the lightest of all woods, with a density of less than 100 kg/mÂ³. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and economic value, it is also considered a potential candidate for reforestation and carbon sequestration projects.</p>
