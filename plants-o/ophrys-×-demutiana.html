                    <h1>Ophrys × demutiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × demutiana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in pollination by male bees. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The species exhibits a high degree of genetic variability, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
