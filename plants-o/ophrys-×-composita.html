                    <h1>Ophrys × composita</h1>
<p>Ophrys × composita, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female bees, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This species thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
