<p>Oxalis acetosella var. vegeta, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow-orange markings and small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Oxalis acetosella var. vegeta is also known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content.</p>
