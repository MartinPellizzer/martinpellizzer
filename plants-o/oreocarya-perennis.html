<p>Oreocarya perennis, commonly known as the perennial oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Oreocarya perennis is adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
