<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>santonica, commonly known as the Saxon bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
