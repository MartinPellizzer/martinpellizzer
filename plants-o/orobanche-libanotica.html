                    <h1>Orobanche libanotica</h1>
<p>Orobanche libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes such as Vicia and Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host species.</p>
