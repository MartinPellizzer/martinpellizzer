<p>Onoclea capensis, commonly known as the Cape water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its habitat.</p>
<p>Onoclea capensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
