                    <h1>Orobanche bungeana</h1>
<p>Orobanche bungeana, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, China, and Nepal. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no leaves. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including agricultural crops like wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite.</p>
