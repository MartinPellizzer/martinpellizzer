                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. minuta</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf rice plant, is a botanical variant of the rice species characterized by its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in wetland environments. The plant has shorter stems and smaller leaves compared to standard rice varieties, which makes it distinct in appearance. It is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
