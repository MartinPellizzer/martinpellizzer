<p>Olamblis oakesiana, commonly known as the Oakes' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that bear bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Olamblis oakesiana is a rare and specialized species, reflecting the diverse evolutionary strategies of carnivorous plants.</p>
