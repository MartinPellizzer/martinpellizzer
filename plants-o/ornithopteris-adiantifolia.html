                    <h1>Ornithopteris adiantifolia</h1>
<p>Ornithopteris adiantifolia, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble the structure of bird wings, hence its genus name.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a finely divided, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
