<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>lepida, commonly known as the Lepid Lizard Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
