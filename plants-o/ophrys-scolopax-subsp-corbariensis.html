<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbi√®res bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the south-western part of France. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to specific microhabitats within the Mediterranean climate zone. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
