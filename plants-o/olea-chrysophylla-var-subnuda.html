                    <h1>Olea chrysophylla var. subnuda</h1>
<p>Olea chrysophylla var. subnuda, commonly known as the silky olive, is a rare and unique variant of the olive tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hair-covered leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas with well-drained soils and mild, humid climates. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common olive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
