                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgare var. aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgare var. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile leaf and a spore-bearing, club-like structure called a sporangium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a unique, primitive morphology that reflects its evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
