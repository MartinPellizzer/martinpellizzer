                    <h1>Ophrys speculum var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Ophrys speculum var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Mirror Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like floral morphology, which features a large, darkly pigmented lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are pollinated through a unique mimicry mechanism, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native range.</p>
