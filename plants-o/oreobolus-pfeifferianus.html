<p>Oreobolus pfeifferianus, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Oreobolus pfeifferianus is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
