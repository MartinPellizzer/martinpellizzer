                    <h1>Ophrys × delphinensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × delphinensis, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant that combines traits from its parent species, Ophrys apifera and Ophrys delphinensis.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its unique floral morphology that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinctive bee-like appearance, including a prominent lip that mimics the abdomen of a bee. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in areas with well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
