<p>Octomeria gehrtii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a deep red color, often containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Octomeria gehrtii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nocturnal pollinators and seed-dispersing animals.</p>
