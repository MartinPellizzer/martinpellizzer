<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>arnoldii, commonly known as the Arnold's bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
