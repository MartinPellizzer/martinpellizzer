                    <h1>Opuntia ciribe</h1>
<p>Opuntia ciribe, commonly known as the Ciribe prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ciribe is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
