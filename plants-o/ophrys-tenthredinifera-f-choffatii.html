                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. choffatii</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. choffatii, commonly known as the Choffatâ€™s bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body.</p>
<p>This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and its role in pollination ecology.</p>
