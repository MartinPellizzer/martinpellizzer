                    <h1>Otopappus glabratus</h1>
<p>Otopappus glabratus, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a low-growing habit and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Otopappus glabratus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
