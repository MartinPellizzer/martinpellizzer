<p>Opuntia minuta, commonly known as the tiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flat, oval-shaped pads, which are covered in fine, pale spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia minuta is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates.</p>
