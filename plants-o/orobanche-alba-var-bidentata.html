                    <h1>Orobanche alba var. bidentata</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba var. bidentata, commonly known as the white broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
