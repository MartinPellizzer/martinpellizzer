                            <h1>Ocampoa Gibbosa</h1>
<p>Ocampoa gibbosa is a rare and fascinating plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is known for its unique morphology, featuring a tall, slender stem and striking, bell-shaped flowers. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and open slopes. Its delicate appearance belies its resilience, as it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ocampoa gibbosa is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
