                    <h1>Ophioderma pendulum</h1>
<p>Ophioderma pendulum, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has thin, delicate stems that often hang from vegetation, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, allowing the plant to focus energy on its specialized bladders.</p>
<p>Ophioderma pendulum thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
