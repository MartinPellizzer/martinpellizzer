                    <h1>Odontochilus occultus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus occultus, commonly known as the hidden tooth orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a unique, tooth-like structure on the lip, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Odontochilus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Odontochilus occultus is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
