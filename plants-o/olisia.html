                    <h1>Olisia</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Olia is, commonly known as the "ghost plant," a unique species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Olisia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts.</p>
