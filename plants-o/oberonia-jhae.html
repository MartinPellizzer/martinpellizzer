                    <h1>Oberonia jhae</h1>
<p>Oberonia jhae, commonly known as the Jhae's orchid, is a rare tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, delicate blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia jhae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
