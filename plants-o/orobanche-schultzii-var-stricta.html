                    <h1>Orobanche schultzii var. stricta</h1>
<p>Orobanche schultzii var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a small, fleshy stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, yellowish or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families, and is found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized plant species.</p>
