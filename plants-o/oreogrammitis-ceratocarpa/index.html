                            <h1>Oreogrammitis Ceratocarpa</h1>
<p>Cork fern, scientifically known as Oreogrammitis ceratocarpa, is a unique and resilient plant native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. The plant gets its name from the cork-like texture of its fronds, which are both durable and visually striking. With its distinctive appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. Despite its hardy nature, it requires careful attention to soil and water conditions to flourish.</p>
