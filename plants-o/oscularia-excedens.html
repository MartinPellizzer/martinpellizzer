<p>Oscularia excedens, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, mat-like growth habit, often forming dense colonies on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water. Oscularia excedens is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
