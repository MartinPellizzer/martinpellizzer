                    <h1>Orobanche lucana</h1>
<p>Orobanche lucana, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in association with legumes such as Vicia and Medicago, which provide the necessary resources for its survival. Orobanche lucana is found in Mediterranean regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the root system of its host through specialized haustoria.</p>
