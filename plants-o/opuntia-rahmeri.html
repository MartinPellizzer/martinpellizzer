                    <h1>Opuntia rahmeri</h1>
<p>Opuntia rahmeri, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in spines and are often referred to as cladodes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia rahmeri is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
