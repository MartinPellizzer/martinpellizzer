<p>Orchis × mackaensis, commonly known as the Mackaensic orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale green to brownish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
