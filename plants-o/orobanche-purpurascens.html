                    <h1>Orobanche purpurascens</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurascens, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of the Americas. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
