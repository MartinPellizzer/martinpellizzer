                    <h1>Origanum kopetdaghense</h1>
<p>Origanum kopetdaghense, commonly known as Kopetdag oregano, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its essential oils contain high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its strong medicinal and culinary properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
