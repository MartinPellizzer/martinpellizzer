                    <h1>Ophioglossum savatieri</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum savatieri, commonly known as the African adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-producing structure called a sporangium, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a distinctive, primitive appearance that reflects its evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum savatieri is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
