<p>Orthochilus litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Orthochilus litoralis is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline.</p>
