                    <h1>Opuntia rafinesquei var. minor</h1>
<p>Opuntia rafinesquei var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal form, var. minor, is distinguished by its smaller size and reduced floral features compared to the typical species.</p>
