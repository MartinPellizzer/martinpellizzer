<p>Orbicularia orbicularis, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a unique species of lichen that forms a compact, rounded growth resembling a small cushion.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in harsh environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, leaf-like structures that are tightly packed together, providing protection against desiccation. It is typically found in arid and rocky habitats, such as deserts and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Orbicularia orbicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
