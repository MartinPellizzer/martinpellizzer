                    <h1>Ophelia racemosa</h1>
<p>Ophelia racemosa, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically divided into small, feathery segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often emerging from the water surface. Ophelia racemosa thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize water bodies make it both a valuable indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats.</p>
