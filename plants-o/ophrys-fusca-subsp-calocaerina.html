<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>calocaerina, commonly known as the dark bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish sepals and petals, which resemble the appearance of a bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid is a striking example of evolutionary adaptation in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
