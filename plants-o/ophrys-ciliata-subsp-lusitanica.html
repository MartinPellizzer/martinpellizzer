<p>Ophrys ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has slender, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
