                    <h1>Orobanche trifolifixa</h1>
<p>Orobanche trifolifixa, commonly known as the three-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived and attract specific pollinators. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grassland and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
