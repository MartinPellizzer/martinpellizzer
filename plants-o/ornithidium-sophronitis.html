                    <h1>Ornithidium sophronitis</h1>
<p>Ornithidium sophronitis, commonly known as the feather orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, intricate flowers that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithidium sophronitis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
