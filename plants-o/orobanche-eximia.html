                    <h1>Orobanche eximia</h1>
<p>Orobanche eximia, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is found in regions such as India, Nepal, and parts of Southeast Asia. It has a short life cycle and produces a large number of tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth of its host plants, making it both a challenge and a subject of ecological study.</p>
