                    <h1>Ophrys × paphosiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × paphosiana, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellow-brown flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base, which enhances its mimicry. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Ophrys × paphosiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique and exotic appearance.</p>
