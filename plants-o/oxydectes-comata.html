                    <h1>Oxydectes comata</h1>
<p>Oxydectes comata, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxydectes comata is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
