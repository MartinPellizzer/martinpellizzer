<p>Osmia oxylepis, commonly known as the oxylepis mason bee, is a species of solitary bee native to various regions in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>This bee is characterized by its robust body and distinctive metallic blue or green coloration, which serves as a form of aposematic coloration to deter predators. Osmia oxylepis is a pollinator that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat, particularly in the pollination of flowering plants. It constructs its nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or abandoned beetle burrows, where it lays its eggs and provisions them with pollen.</p>
<p>The plant-related aspects of Osmia oxylepis are closely tied to its foraging behavior, as it relies on a variety of flowering plants for nectar and pollen collection.</p>
