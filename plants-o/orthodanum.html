<p>Orthodanum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Orthodanum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to livestock.</p>
