                    <h1>Orobanche alsatica var. libanotidis</h1>
<p>Orobanche alsatica var. libanotidis, commonly known as the Lebanon broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean, including Lebanon, Syria, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants, particularly those in the legume family.</p>
