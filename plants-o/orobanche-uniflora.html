                    <h1>Orobanche uniflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow or orange in color. It has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host, allowing it to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, often growing in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils.</p>
