<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>laxata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system consists of a long, tuberous structure that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its reduced floral structure and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
