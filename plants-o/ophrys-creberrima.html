                    <h1>Ophrys creberrima</h1>
<p>Ophrys creberrima, commonly known as the common bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees through a process called sexual deception, where the orchid lures the bees to transfer pollen.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in calcareous soils.</p>
