<p>Ophrys × gumprechtii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>pierae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and unusual plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys gumprechtii and Ophrys pierii. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid characteristics, including a slender stem and a single, showy flower.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its mimicry of female wasps, a trait that aids in its pollination strategy by attracting male wasps. It thrives in specific alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
