                    <h1>Oplonia</h1>
<p>Oplonia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. Oplonia species are often found in heathlands and rocky habitats, where they contribute to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Their ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions makes them an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
