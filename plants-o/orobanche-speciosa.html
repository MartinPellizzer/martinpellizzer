                    <h1>Orobanche speciosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche speciosa, commonly known as the showy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators. The plant's structure consists of a main stem with branched, thread-like branches that attach to the host plant's roots. It is found in various regions of the United States, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
