                    <h1>Ophioglossum brevipes</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum brevipes, commonly known as the short-tongued adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporangium that is often covered in a dense, velvety coat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporangia producing spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum brevipes is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
