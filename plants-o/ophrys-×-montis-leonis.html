                    <h1>Ophrys × montis-leonis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × montis-leonis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate floral structures.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique mimicry of female wasps, a trait that aids in its pollination by male wasps through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, favoring well-drained, acidic soils and cool, moist climates. Its flowers are characterized by their specialized labellum, which plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine or subalpine environments across Europe.</p>
