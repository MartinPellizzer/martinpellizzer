<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>fenarolii, commonly known as the Fenno-Russian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, bee-like scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
