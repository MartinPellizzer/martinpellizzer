<p>Ophrys panormitana subsp.</p>
<p>praecox, commonly known as the early orchid of Pantelleria, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the volcanic island of Pantelleria in Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex lip and column typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowering period occurs early in the growing season, usually between March and May.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns.</p>
