                    <h1>Orthochilus euanthus</h1>
<p>Orthochilus euanthus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
