                    <h1>Orobanche kashmirica</h1>
<p>Orobanche kashmirica, commonly known as the Kashmir broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including parts of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
