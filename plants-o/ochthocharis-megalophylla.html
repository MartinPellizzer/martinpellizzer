                    <h1>Ochthocharis megalophylla</h1>
<p>Ochthocharis megalophylla, commonly known as the giant pleurostoma, is a rare and striking fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach impressive sizes. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ochthocharis megalophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
