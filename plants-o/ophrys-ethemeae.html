                    <h1>Ophrys ethemeae</h1>
<p>Ophrys ethemeae, commonly known as the Etna orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, often in the vicinity of Mount Etna. Its flowers are small, with intricate patterns and a strong, wasp-like scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys ethemeae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
