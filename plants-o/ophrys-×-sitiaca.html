                    <h1>Ophrys × sitiaca</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sitiaca, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown with a distinctive, bee-like shape, and it produces small, greenish-brown seeds.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sitiaca is often found in calcareous grasslands and is a rare but striking example of hybridization in the orchid family.</p>
