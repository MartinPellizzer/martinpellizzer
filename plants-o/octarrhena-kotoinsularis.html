                    <h1>Octarrhena kotoinsularis</h1>
<p>Octarrhena kotoinsularis, commonly known as the Kotoinsularis grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the island regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated primarily by wind. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
