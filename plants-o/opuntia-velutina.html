<p>Opuntia velutina, commonly known as the velvet opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia velutina is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife.</p>
