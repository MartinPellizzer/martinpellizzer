                    <h1>Orobanche mariana</h1>
<p>Orobanche mariana, commonly known as the Mexican barrenstar, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the nightshade family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, and it often blooms in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats.</p>
