<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>taurica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
