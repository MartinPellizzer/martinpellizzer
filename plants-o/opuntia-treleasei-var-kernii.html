                    <h1>Opuntia treleasei var. kernii</h1>
<p>Opuntia treleasei var. kernii, commonly known as the Kern's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia treleasei var. kernii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.</p>
