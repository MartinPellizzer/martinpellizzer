                    <h1>Ophioglossum loureiroanum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum loureiroanum, commonly known as the horse tail fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a fleshy, club-like sporophyll that resembles a horse's tail, hence its common name. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves a short-lived gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitats.</p>
