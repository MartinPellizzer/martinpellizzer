<p>Opsiandra gomez-pompae, commonly known as the Puya gomez-pompae, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, known for its diverse and often showy foliage and flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth in arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of tall, branched clusters of small, spathaceous flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
