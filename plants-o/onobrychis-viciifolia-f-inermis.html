<p>Onobrychis viciifolia f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth sainfoin, is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The smooth, hairless texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of sainfoin.</p>
