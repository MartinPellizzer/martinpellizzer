                    <h1>Orchis angustifolia var. arcuata</h1>
<p>Orchis angustifolia var. arcuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
