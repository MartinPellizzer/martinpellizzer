                    <h1>Orobanche orientalis</h1>
<p>Orobanche orientalis, commonly known as the oriental broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
