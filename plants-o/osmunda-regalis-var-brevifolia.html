                    <h1>Osmunda regalis var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the southern royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and swampy areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
