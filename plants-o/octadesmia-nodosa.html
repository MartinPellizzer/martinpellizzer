<p>Octadesmia nodosa, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that is rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are typically found on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Octadesmia nodosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
