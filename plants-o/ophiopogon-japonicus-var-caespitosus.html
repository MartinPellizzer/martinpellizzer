                    <h1>Ophiopogon japonicus var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Ophiopogon japonicus var. caespitosus, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover.</p>
