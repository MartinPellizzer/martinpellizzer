                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera subvar. bavarica</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera subvar. bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
