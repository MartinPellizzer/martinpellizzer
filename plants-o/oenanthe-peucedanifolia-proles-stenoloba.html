                    <h1>Oenanthe peucedanifolia proles stenoloba</h1>
<p>Oenanthe peucedanifolia proles stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
