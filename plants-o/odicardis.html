<p>Odicardis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves with a silvery-blue hue, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.

Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Odicardis is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
