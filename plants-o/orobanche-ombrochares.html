                    <h1>Orobanche ombrochares</h1>
<p>Orobanche ombrochares, commonly known as the rainy weather broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host species.</p>
