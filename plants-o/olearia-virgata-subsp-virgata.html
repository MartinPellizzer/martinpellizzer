<p>Olearia virgata subsp.</p>
<p>virgata, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is somewhat slow-growing and requires careful management.</p>
