                    <h1>Orchis majalis f. magnicalcarata</h1>
<p>Orchis majalis f. magnicalcarata, commonly known as the large-fruited early purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces elongated, hairy pods that contain the seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its notably larger, more robust fruiting structures compared to the typical form of Orchis majalis.</p>
