<p>Orobanche caryophyllacea, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pink in color. It typically parasitizes members of the Caryophyllaceae family, such as carnations and chickweed.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
