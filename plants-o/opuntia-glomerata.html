<p>Opuntia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia glomerata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and edible qualities.</p>
