                    <h1>Ochagavia</h1>
<p>Ochagavia, commonly known as the silver grass or silver hair grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and are characterized by their distinctive silver-gray foliage. Ochagavia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions, some species are cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
