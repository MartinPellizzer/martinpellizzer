<p>Opuntia kunzei var. wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to desert climates and a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
