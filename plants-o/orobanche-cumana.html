                    <h1>Orobanche cumana</h1>
<p>Orobanche cumana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle depends on the germination of its seeds in proximity to suitable host roots.</p>
<p>Orobanche cumana is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
