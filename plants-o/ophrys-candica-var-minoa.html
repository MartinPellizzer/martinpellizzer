                    <h1>Ophrys candica var. minoa</h1>
<p>Ophrys candica var. minoa, commonly known as the Minotaur orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist climate with high humidity. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the species is noted for its limited distribution and conservation status.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Ophrys candica var. minoa is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
