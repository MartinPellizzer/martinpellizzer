                    <h1>Ophrys fusca var. dyris</h1>
<p>Ophrys fusca var. dyris, commonly known as the Dyris bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a distinctive bee-like appearance that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence bearing several showy, resupinate flowers with a specialized labellum. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
