                    <h1>Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. cylindricus</h1>
<p>Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical cranberry, is a botanical variant of the cranberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, elongated berries that differ from the typical round shape of other cranberry varieties. This form is often found in specific ecological niches, particularly in wetland environments. The plant is a dwarf shrub with small, evergreen leaves and is closely related to other species in the Vacciniaceae family.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation and adaptation.</p>
