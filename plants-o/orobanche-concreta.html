                    <h1>Orobanche concreta</h1>
<p>Orobanche concreta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with no true leaves. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seedlings emerging in response to chemical signals released by the host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
