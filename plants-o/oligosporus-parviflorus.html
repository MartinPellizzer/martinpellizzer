                    <h1>Oligosporus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered spore plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, small white flowers. The plant's leaves are simple and opposite, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligosporus parviflorus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
