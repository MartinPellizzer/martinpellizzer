                    <h1>Ostinia</h1>
<p>Ostinia, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy, composite flower heads that typically range in color from white to purple. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Ostinia species are often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects.</p>
<p>The plant's latex is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it a defensive adaptation against herbivores.</p>
