                    <h1>Oldenlandia scopulorum</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia scopulorum, commonly known as rock dodder, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
