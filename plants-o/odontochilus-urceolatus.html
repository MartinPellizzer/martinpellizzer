                    <h1>Odontochilus urceolatus</h1>
<p>Odontochilus urceolatus, commonly known as the urn-shaped orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, porous growing media.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
