                    <h1>Oryzopsis humilis</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Oryzopsis humilis thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study.</p>
