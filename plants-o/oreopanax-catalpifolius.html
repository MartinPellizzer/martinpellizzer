                    <h1>Oreopanax catalpifolius</h1>
<p>Oreopanax catalpifolius, commonly known as the Catalpa-leafed Oreopanax, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the catalpa tree, hence its common name. The plant typically features a dense canopy of dark green, leathery foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Oreopanax catalpifolius is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
