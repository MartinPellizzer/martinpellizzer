                    <h1>Ochthocharis bornensis</h1>
<p>Ochthocharis bornensis, commonly known as the Bornholm water-plantain, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of the Baltic Sea region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spathes, a feature typical of the Alismataceae family. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Ochthocharis bornensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
