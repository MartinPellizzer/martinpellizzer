                <h1>Oxygraphis nubigena</h1>
<p>Oxygraphis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to high-altitude cloud forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale-blue flowers that bloom in the misty conditions of its habitat. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments where it often grows on rock faces or in the canopy of ancient trees. Its unique adaptations allow it to absorb moisture from the air, making it highly specialized for its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Oxygraphis nubigena is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
