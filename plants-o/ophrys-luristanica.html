                    <h1>Ophrys luristanica</h1>
<p>Ophrys luristanica, commonly known as the Luristan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys luristanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
