<p>Oberonia swaminathanii, commonly known as the Swaminathan's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the monsoon season. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia swaminathanii is considered critically endangered and requires urgent protection efforts.</p>
