                    <h1>Orthotactus nemorosus</h1>
<p>Orthotactus nemorosus, commonly known as the forest lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, crust-like thallus with a greenish to yellowish coloration, often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide photosynthetic capability, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for forest health.</p>
