                    <h1>Oncostemum phyllarthoides</h1>
<p>Oncostemum phyllarthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oncostemum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in spring. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oncostemum phyllarthoides is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
