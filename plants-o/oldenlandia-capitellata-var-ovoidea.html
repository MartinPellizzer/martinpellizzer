                    <h1>Oldenlandia capitellata var. ovoidea</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia capitellata var. ovoidea, commonly known as the egg-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and capsule-like fruits. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is native to parts of Africa and is typically found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
