                    <h1>Oenanthe stolonifera var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Oenanthe stolonifera var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the ground. The leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a fern, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
