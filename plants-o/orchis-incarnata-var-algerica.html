                    <h1>Orchis incarnata var. algerica</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata var. algerica, commonly known as the Algerian spotted orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of North Africa and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spotted purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Orchis incarnata by its more compact growth form and specific floral markings.</p>
