<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and scrub habitats. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store nutrients.</p>
<p>The subspecies is noted for its subtle coloration and specialized pollination mechanism, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
