<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>exaltata, commonly known as the tall orchid bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
