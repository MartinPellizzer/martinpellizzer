                    <h1>Orchis collina</h1>
<p>Orchis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers with a lip that is often darker in color. Orchis collina thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for biodiverse habitats and its ecological value to pollinators.</p>
