                    <h1>Ophrys ficalhoana</h1>
<p>Ophrys ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalho's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a scent that mimics the pheromones of bees. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
