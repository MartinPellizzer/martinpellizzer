                    <h1>Orobanche canescens var. flavidiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche canescens var. flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to anchor itself to the roots of its host, typically members of the legume family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops.</p>
