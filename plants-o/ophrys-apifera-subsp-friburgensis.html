<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>friburgensis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe, particularly the Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display of yellow and brown markings.</p>
<p>The subspecies friburgensis is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Ophrys apifera.</p>
