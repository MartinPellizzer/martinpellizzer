<p>Orchis incarnata subsp.</p>
<p>munbyana, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense spikes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata.</p>
