                    <h1>Orobanche</h1>
<p>Orobanche, commonly known as the broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself to the roots of various species such as tomatoes and beans. The plant produces small, often yellow or reddish flowers and is found in temperate regions worldwide. Orobanche has been studied for its impact on agriculture due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots.</p>
