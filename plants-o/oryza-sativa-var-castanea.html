                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. castanea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. castanea, commonly known as the red rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated subspecies of rice.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish pericarp, which gives it a unique appearance compared to the more common white or brown rice varieties. This variety is typically found in specific regions of Asia, where it has been historically used for both culinary and traditional purposes. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and shares many genetic traits with other rice species.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is limited due to lower yields and specific environmental requirements, making it a subject of interest in agricultural research.</p>
