                    <h1>Orobanche cernua var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua var. bicolor, commonly known as the common dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, two-colored flowers, typically pink and white, which are often clustered in racemose inflorescences. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including grasses and legumes, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite.</p>
