                    <h1>Opuntia roseana</h1>
<p>Opuntia roseana, commonly known as the rose prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, called a tuna, is a edible, sweet, and fleshy berry that ripens in the fall.</p>
<p>Opuntia roseana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption.</p>
