                    <h1>Orobanche epithymum var. major</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymum var. major, commonly known as the greater yellow sand-verbena, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, allowing it to persist in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
