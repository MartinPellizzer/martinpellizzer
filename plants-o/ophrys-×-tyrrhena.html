                    <h1>Ophrys × tyrrhena</h1>
<p>Ophrys × tyrrhena, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, both of which are known for their mimicry of female insects. The plant produces striking flowers that closely resemble female bees, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, each with a three-lobed lip that mimics the appearance of an insect's abdomen.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands across Europe.</p>
