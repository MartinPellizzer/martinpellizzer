                    <h1>Oligomeris subulata</h1>
<p>Oligomeris subulata, commonly known as the slender-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*, through specialized roots called haustoria. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant parasitism and ecological interactions.</p>
