<p>Oreorchis discigera, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Heath Orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a rhizomatous orchid, meaning it has underground stems that help it spread and survive in its environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
