                    <h1>Opuntia aggeria</h1>
<p>Opuntia aggeria, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in traditional cuisines. Its pads, or cladodes, are modified stems that perform photosynthesis and are used for propagation.</p>
<p>Opuntia aggeria is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
