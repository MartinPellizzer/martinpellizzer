<p>Orchis mascula lusus rosea, commonly known as the pink twayblade, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a striking pink or purple flower spike that typically blooms in late spring.

Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
