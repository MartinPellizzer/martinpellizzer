                    <h1>Oroya neoperuviana var. depressa</h1>
<p>Oroya neoperuviana var. depressa, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Boraginaceae family, sharing similar structural and floral features.</p>
