                    <h1>Ophioglossum valdivianum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum valdivianum, commonly known as the Valdivian adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the temperate rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically surrounded by a protective sheath. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces two types of leaves: a sterile, broad leaf and a spore-producing, narrow leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rare flora in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
