                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. subsubulata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. subsubulata, commonly known as the subsubulata rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated rice subspecies native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, subulate (slender and pointed) leaf blades and shorter grain length compared to other rice varieties. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with reduced tillering, making it suitable for specific agricultural conditions. Its genetic traits have been studied for potential use in rice breeding programs to improve drought tolerance and yield under stress conditions.</p>
<p>This variety contributes to the genetic diversity of cultivated rice, offering insights into adaptation strategies in rice evolution.</p>
