                    <h1>Odontites × sennenii</h1>
<p>Odontites × sennenii, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Odontites litoralis and O. vernalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are underdeveloped, as it does not produce viable seeds or spores.</p>
<p>Odontites × sennenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
