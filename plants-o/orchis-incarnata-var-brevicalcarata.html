                    <h1>Orchis incarnata var. brevicalcarata</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, unbranched stems bearing showy, violet-purple flowers with short, spurred petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its shorter spur compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata.</p>
