<p>Onosma angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Onosma angustissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
