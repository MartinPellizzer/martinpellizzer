<p>Onobrychis subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burclover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in bur-like pods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Native to the Mediterranean region, it is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
