                    <h1>Oreosalsola abrotanoides</h1>
<p>Oreosalsola abrotanoides, commonly known as the Mexican thornapple, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with small teeth along the edges.</p>
<p>Oreosalsola abrotanoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
