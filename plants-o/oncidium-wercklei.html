<p>Oncidium wercklei, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant yellow and green flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium wercklei thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
