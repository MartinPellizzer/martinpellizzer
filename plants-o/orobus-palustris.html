<p>Orobus palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a slender stem that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, bearing showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Orobus palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
