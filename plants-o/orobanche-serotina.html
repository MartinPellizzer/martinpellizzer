                    <h1>Orobanche serotina</h1>
<p>Orobanche serotina, commonly known as the winter barrenweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
