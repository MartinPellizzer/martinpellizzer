                    <h1>Orobanche albolanata</h1>
<p>Orobanche albolanata, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stem and small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on agricultural crops.</p>
