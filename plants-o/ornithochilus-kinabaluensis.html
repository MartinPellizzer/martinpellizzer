<p>Ornithochilus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist microhabitats such as mossy rock faces and shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat degradation.</p>
