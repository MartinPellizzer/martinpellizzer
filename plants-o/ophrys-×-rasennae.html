                    <h1>Ophrys × rasennae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × rasennae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their mimicry of female insects. The plant produces striking flowers that closely resemble female bees, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its floral structure includes a labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
