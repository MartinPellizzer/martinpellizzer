                    <h1>Oryza glaberrima var. subaristata</h1>
<p>Oryza glaberrima var. subaristata, commonly known as the African rice, is a wild rice species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, oval-shaped grains. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in flooded conditions. It is closely related to the domesticated rice species Oryza sativa and has been studied for its potential in improving rice resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity offers valuable resources for breeding programs aimed at enhancing rice sustainability.</p>
