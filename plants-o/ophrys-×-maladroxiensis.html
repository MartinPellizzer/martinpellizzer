                    <h1>Ophrys × maladroxiensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × maladroxiensis, commonly known as the Maladroxiensis Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that serve as a mimicry mechanism to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and France. Its floral structure includes a labellum that resembles a female bee, enhancing its ability to deceive pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rarity and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
