<p>Oplismenus tomentosus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Oplismenus tomentosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
