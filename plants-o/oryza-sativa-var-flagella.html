                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. flagella</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. flagella, commonly known as the long-stemmed rice variety, is a rice plant characterized by its elongated inflorescences and slender grains.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique botanical features, including a tall stem and a reduced number of tillers compared to other rice types. Its grains are typically longer and thinner, which can affect both its culinary uses and yield potential. The plant's growth habit makes it suitable for specific agricultural conditions, such as well-drained soils and moderate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct morphology, it is often studied for its genetic and agronomic traits in rice breeding programs.</p>
