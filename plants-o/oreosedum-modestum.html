                    <h1>Oreosedum modestum</h1>
<p>Oreosedum modestum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Oreosedum modestum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
