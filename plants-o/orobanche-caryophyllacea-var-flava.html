                    <h1>Orobanche caryophyllacea var. flava</h1>
<p>Orobanche caryophyllacea var. flava, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and branched, leafless stems. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can infest crops like tomatoes and beans. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host using specialized haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield loss in cultivated plants.</p>
