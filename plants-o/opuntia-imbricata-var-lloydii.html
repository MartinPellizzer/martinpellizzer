                    <h1>Opuntia imbricata var. lloydii</h1>
<p>Opuntia imbricata var. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction highlights its unique morphological traits compared to other Opuntia species.</p>
