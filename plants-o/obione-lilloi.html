<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione lilloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
