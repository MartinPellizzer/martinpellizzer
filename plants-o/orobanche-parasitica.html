                    <h1>Orobanche parasitica</h1>
<p>Orobanche parasitica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a root parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its highly reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of various host plants, such as those in the legume family, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is found in a variety of habitats, including agricultural fields and disturbed soils, and can be a problematic weed in crops.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions and can impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
