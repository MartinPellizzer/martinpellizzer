                <h1>Omentaria cepacea</h1>
<p>Omentaria cepacea, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing sporangia. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which aids in its survival in humid environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically leathery and have a deep green color, with a distinct appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
