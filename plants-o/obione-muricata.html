                    <h1>Obione muricata</h1>
<p>Obione muricata, commonly known as the spiky coral plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem covered in sharp, spine-like structures that protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry climate. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
