                    <h1>Oligosporus littoreus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus littoreus, commonly known as the coastal spore moss, is a unique aquatic plant found in brackish and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cymodocaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-producing structures that thrive in moist, saline conditions. The plant's morphology includes delicate, filamentous stems and specialized reproductive organs that facilitate spore dispersal. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting microfauna in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Oligosporus littoreus is an indicator species for environmental health in coastal ecosystems.</p>
