                    <h1>Opopanax syriacus</h1>
<p>Opopanax syriacus, commonly known as the Syrian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with dark, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves. Its resin, often referred to as "opoponax," has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
