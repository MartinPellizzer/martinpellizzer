                    <h1>Ornitrophe magica</h1>
<p>Ornitrophe magica, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its most distinctive feature is its bioluminescent petals, which glow softly in the dark, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that absorbs minerals from the rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating that reflects moonlight, giving it a mystical appearance.</p>
<p>Botanists believe the plant contains unique phytochemicals that may have potential medicinal properties.</p>
