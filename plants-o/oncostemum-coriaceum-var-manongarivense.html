<p>Oncostemum coriaceum var. manongarivense, commonly known as the Manongariv√© cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Andes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
