<p>Oxalis ramigera, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often mistaken for true sorrel species due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>Oxalis ramigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
