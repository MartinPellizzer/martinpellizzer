                    <h1>Onopordum horridissimum</h1>
<p>Onopordum horridissimum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with large, basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of overlapping, spiny bracts. Its leaves and stems are covered in dense, prickly hairs that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands.</p>
