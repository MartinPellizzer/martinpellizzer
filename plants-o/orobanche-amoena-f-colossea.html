<p>Orobanche amoena f. colossea, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
