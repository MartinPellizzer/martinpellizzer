                    <h1>Orchis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Orchis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale pink or greenish flowers, which are often obscured by leaf-like structures. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Orchis pauciflora is a protected species in some regions due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
