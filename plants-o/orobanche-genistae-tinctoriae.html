                    <h1>Orobanche genistae-tinctoriae</h1>
<p>Orobanche genistae-tinctoriae, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as Genista species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
