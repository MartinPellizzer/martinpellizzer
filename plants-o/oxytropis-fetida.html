                    <h1>Oxytropis fetida</h1>
<p>Oxytropis fetida, commonly known as skunk vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strongly aromatic, often foul-smelling foliage and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Oxytropis fetida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil.</p>
