                    <h1>Ornithidium minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium minutiflorum, commonly known as the tiny flower orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their minute size. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
