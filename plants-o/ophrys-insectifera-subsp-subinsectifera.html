<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>subinsectifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a vivid display of yellow and brown markings that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized relationship with specific pollinators, enhancing its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
