                    <h1>Orthopappus</h1>
<p>Orthopappus, commonly known as the spiny pappus plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive bracts that form a spiny, pappus-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. Orthopappus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are often yellow or white in color.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
