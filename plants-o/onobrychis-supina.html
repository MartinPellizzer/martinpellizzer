<p>Onobrychis supina, commonly known as creeping bursfoot, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places.</p>
<p>Onobrychis supina is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
