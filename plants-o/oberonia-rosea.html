                    <h1>Oberonia rosea</h1>
<p>Oberonia rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green to purple-colored foliage and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia rosea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
