                    <h1>Ormosia tapajosensis</h1>
<p>Ormosia tapajosensis, commonly known as the Tapaj√≥s ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Ormosia tapajosensis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
