                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. marianica</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. marianica, commonly known as the Marianica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctively shaped labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
