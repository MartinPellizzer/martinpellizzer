                    <h1>Ozothamnus diosmifolius</h1>
<p>Ozothamnus diosmifolius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ozothamnus diosmifolius is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert landscapes.</p>
