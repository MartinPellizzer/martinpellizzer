                    <h1>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides, commonly known as the horse-tail fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Its leaves are long and strap-like, with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia that are often covered in a protective sheath.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
