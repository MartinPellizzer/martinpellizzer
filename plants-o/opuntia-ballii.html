                    <h1>Opuntia ballii</h1>
<p>Opuntia ballii, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia ballii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
