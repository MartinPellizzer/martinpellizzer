<p>Oreogrammitis conformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moss, is a small, delicate moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its closely appressed growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The leaves are typically curved and have a distinct midrib, which is often visible on the upper surface. This moss is commonly found on rock surfaces, soil, and decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of many microhabitats.</p>
