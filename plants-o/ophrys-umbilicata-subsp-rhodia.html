<p>Ophrys umbilicata subsp.</p>
<p>rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that resembles a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and limestone slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
