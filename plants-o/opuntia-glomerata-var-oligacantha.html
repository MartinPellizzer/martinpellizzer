                    <h1>Opuntia glomerata var. oligacantha</h1>
<p>Opuntia glomerata var. oligacantha, commonly known as the narrow-armed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are shorter and more clustered compared to other Opuntia species, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
