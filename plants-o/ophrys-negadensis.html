                    <h1>Ophrys negadensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys negadensis, commonly known as the Negada Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys negadensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
