<p>Ouratea rupununiensis, commonly known as the Rupununi ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its range.</p>
