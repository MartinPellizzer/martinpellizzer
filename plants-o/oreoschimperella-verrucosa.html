<p>Oreoschimperella verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus with a distinctive, uneven surface covered in small, rounded warts. The lichen typically grows on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces, forming dense, sprawling colonies. Its color ranges from pale yellow to olive green, depending on the season and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Oreoschimperella verrucosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
