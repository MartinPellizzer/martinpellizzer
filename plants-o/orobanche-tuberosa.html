                    <h1>Orobanche tuberosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche tuberosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. The plant has a short, stout stem with no true leaves, and its flowers are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
