                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. beirana</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. beirana, commonly known as the Beiranean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
