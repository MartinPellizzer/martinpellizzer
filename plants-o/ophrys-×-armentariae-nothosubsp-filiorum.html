<p>Ophrys × armentariae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>filiorum, commonly known as the filial orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys armentaria and Ophrys filiorum. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic female insects, a trait known as pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, shaded habitats, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are notable for their vivid coloration and specialized morphology, which play a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits genetic diversity due to its hybrid origin, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
