                    <h1>Orthophytum disjunctum var. striatum</h1>
<p>Orthophytum disjunctum var. striatum, commonly known as the striated orthophytum, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often marked with distinct stripes or bands. The plant produces striking, tall flower stalks that bear small, yellowish-green flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
