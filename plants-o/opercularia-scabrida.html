<p>Opercularia scabrida, commonly known as the rough opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, with the fungus providing structure and the alga performing photosynthesis. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to air pollution and is considered an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
