<p>Opuntia pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pycnantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened, leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
