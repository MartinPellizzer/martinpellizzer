<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>creticola, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
