                <h1>Oberonia latisegmenta</h1>
<p>Oberonia latisegmenta, commonly known as the broad-segmented orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes prominently displayed, spurred petals.</p>
