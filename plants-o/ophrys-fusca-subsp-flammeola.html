<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>flammeola, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a phenomenon known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, vividly colored flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its pollination strategy. It thrives in specific habitats, such as calcareous soils, and requires a cool, moist environment for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
