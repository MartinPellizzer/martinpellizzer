                    <h1>Oritrophium paramense</h1>
<p>Oritrophium paramense, commonly known as the Paramo Orithrophy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude ecosystems of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, cool environments, often in cloud forests or paramo habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Oritrophium paramense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native range.</p>
