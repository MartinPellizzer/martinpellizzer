The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
