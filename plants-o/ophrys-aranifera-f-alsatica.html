                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera f. alsatica</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera f. alsatica, commonly known as the Alsatic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive hooded labellum that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
