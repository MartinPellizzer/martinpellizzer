<p>Ophrys exaltata subsp.</p>
<p>mateolana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bee-like flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually basal, lanceolate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often a striking shade of yellow or brown, emit a scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
