<p>Ooia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Ooia kinabaluensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
