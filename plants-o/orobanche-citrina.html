                    <h1>Orobanche citrina</h1>
<p>Orobanche citrina, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops, making it a concern for farmers.</p>
