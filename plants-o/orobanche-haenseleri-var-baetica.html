                    <h1>Orobanche haenseleri var. baetica</h1>
<p>Orobanche haenseleri var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetican broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host seeds. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in Mediterranean habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
