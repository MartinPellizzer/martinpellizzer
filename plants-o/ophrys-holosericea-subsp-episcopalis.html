<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>episcopalis, commonly known as the episcopal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like appearance, with a pouch-shaped lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
