<p>Oreobolus oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or inland plains. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact heads, which are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Oreobolus oligocephalus is well-suited to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
