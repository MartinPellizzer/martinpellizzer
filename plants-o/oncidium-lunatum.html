<p>Oncidium lunatum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, moon-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with green veins. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in clusters of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, broad, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncidium lunatum is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
