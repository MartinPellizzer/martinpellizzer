<p>Ophrys galilaea subsp.</p>
<p>melena, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, often mimicking female wasps to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
