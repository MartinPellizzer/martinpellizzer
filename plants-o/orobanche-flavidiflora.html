                    <h1>Orobanche flavidiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops, making it both a challenge and a subject of ecological study.</p>
