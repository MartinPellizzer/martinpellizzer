<p>Orobanche centaureae-scabiosae, commonly known as the pink broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with plants like Centaurea and Scabiosa species. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to the roots of host plants through specialized haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
