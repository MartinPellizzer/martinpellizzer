<p>Oldenlandia hygrophila, commonly known as the water willow or swamp spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize wet areas make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
