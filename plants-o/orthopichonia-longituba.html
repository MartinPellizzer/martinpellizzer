<p>Orthopichonia longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
