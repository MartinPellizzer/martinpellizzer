<p>Ophrys bertolonii var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
