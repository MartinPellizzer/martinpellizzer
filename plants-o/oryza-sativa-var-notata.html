                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. notata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. notata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rice, is a less common variant of the rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and smaller grains compared to the more widely cultivated indica and japonica varieties. This variety is primarily found in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it has adapted to unique environmental conditions. Its botanical features include a shorter plant stature and a distinct flowering pattern that differs from other rice types.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is of particular interest to botanists and geneticists studying rice diversity and evolution.</p>
