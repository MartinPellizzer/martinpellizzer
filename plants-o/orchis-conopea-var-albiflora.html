                    <h1>Orchis conopea var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis conopea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical greenish-yellow of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or grassy areas. The plant has a unique floral structure with a lip that mimics the appearance of a bee, aiding in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its role in the study of orchid evolution and pollination strategies.</p>
