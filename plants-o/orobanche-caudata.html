<p>Orobanche caudata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on crops such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with a reddish tinge. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
