                    <h1>Ononis hircina var. spinosiformis</h1>
<p>Ononis hircina var. spinosiformis, commonly known as the spiny horned vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, lens-shaped pods. Its distinguishing feature is the presence of spines on the stem and leaf stipules, which provide mechanical defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
