<p>Ononis arenaria, commonly known as sandrocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Sandrocket is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
