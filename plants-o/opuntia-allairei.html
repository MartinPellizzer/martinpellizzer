<p>Opuntia allairei, commonly known as the Allaire's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures that bear flowers and later, fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia allairei is well-suited to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
