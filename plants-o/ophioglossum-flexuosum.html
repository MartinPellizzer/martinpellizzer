                    <h1>Ophioglossum flexuosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum flexuosum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a long, narrow, leafless stalk that supports a single, large, compound leaf. The plant is notable for its primitive structure, resembling early ferns from the Paleozoic era. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum flexuosum is also known for its sporangia, which are clustered in a spore-producing structure at the base of the leaf.</p>
