                    <h1>Octarillum</h1>
<p>Octarillum, commonly known as the "buttercup plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Octarillum species often have a creeping rhizome system that allows them to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
