                    <h1>Orogenia linearifolia var. lata</h1>
<p>Orogenia linearifolia var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf orogenia, is a variant of the orogenia plant characterized by its wider, more elongated leaves compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with multiple branches that produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
