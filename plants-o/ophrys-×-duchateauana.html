                    <h1>Ophrys × duchateauana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × duchateauana, commonly known as the Duchateau's bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a dark, fuzzy lower petal resembling a bee's body. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers produce nectar to attract pollinators, primarily bees, through a specialized mimicry of female bees.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination networks.</p>
