<p>Onoclea pensylvatica, commonly known as the eastern brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and marshes across eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through flowers and asexual reproduction via vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
