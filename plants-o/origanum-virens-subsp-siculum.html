<p>Origanum virens subsp.</p>
<p>siculum, commonly known as Sicilian oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are rich in essential oils.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in cooking for its pungent, slightly sweet flavor, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued both for its culinary applications and its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
