                    <h1>Ornithidium confertum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium confertum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a simple morphology with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Ornithidium confertum is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
