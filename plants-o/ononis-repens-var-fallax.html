                    <h1>Ononis repens var. fallax</h1>
<p>Ononis repens var. fallax, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky soils in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or barren ground.</p>
