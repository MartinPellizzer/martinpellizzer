                    <h1>Orobanche grayana var. nelsonii</h1>
<p>Orobanche grayana var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in association with grasses and shrubs. It produces small, pale flowers that are usually clustered in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
