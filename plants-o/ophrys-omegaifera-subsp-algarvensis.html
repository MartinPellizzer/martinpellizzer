<p>Ophrys omegaifera subsp.</p>
<p>algarvensis, commonly known as the Algarve bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Portugal. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific microhabitats such as rocky outcrops and open woodland areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
