                    <h1>Oryza mutica</h1>
<p>Oryza mutica, commonly known as the slender ricegrass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, rice-like grains that mature in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce panicles of tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Oryza mutica is often used in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its potential as a wild relative of cultivated rice.</p>
