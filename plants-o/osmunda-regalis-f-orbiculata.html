                    <h1>Osmunda regalis f. orbiculata</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis f. orbiculata, commonly known as the royal fern or cinnamon fern, is a distinctive fern species characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fertile fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology. The fronds exhibit a unique two-tiered structure, with sterile and fertile leaves forming distinct layers.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems as a habitat and food source for various organisms.</p>
