<p>Osmundastrum imbricatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular, serrated fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Osmundastrum imbricatum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
