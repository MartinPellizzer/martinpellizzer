                    <h1>Ophioglossum pusillum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum pusillum, commonly known as the small adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, unbranched leaf that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, club-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophioglossum pusillum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
