                    <h1>Orthochilus calanthoides</h1>
<p>Orthochilus calanthoides, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
