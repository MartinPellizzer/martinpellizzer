                    <h1>Ophrys × rasbachii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × rasbachii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and meadows, preferring calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green, with a distinctive central 'labellum' that resembles a bee's face.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, Ophrys × rasbachii is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
