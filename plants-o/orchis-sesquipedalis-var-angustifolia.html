                    <h1>Orchis sesquipedalis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Orchis sesquipedalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf early purple orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
