                    <h1>Oxytropis viscida var. subsucculenta</h1>
<p>Oxytropis viscida var. subsucculenta, commonly known as the sticky locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture and help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often recurved, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
