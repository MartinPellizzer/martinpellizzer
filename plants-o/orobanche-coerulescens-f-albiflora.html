                    <h1>Orobanche coerulescens f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche coerulescens f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish stems and white or pale flowers. This subspecies is typically found in sandy or disturbed soils, often growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive tubular shape that facilitates pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
