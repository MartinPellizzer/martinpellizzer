                    <h1>Ophrys × breuerorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × breuerorum, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its habitat typically includes calcareous soils in open grasslands and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
<p>This hybrid species is notable for its morphological and genetic diversity, reflecting its complex evolutionary history.</p>
