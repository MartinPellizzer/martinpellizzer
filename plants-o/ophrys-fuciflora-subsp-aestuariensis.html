<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>aestuariensis, commonly known as the salt marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions.</p>
