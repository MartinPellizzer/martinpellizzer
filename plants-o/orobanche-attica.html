                    <h1>Orobanche attica</h1>
<p>Orobanche attica, commonly known as the Greek broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in the Mediterranean region and is particularly associated with leguminous hosts such as vetches and alfalfa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, tubular structure that aids in pollination. Its life cycle is closely linked to the growth patterns of its host, and it can significantly affect agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many cultivated areas.</p>
