                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. nudicaule</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem fern, is a unique and ancient plant species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, and it lacks true stems, hence its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a terminal spike, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its primitive structure and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil and of great interest to botanists.</p>
