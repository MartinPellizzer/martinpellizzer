                    <h1>Orobanche helicis</h1>
<p>Orobanche helicis, commonly known as the helix broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species.</p>
