                    <h1>Orobanche pruinosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, primarily those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
