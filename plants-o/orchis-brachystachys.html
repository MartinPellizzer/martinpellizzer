                    <h1>Orchis brachystachys</h1>
<p>Orchis brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are highly specialized, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Orchis brachystachys is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
