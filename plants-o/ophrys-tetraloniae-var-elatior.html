                    <h1>Ophrys tetraloniae var. elatior</h1>
<p>Ophrys tetraloniae var. elatior, commonly known as the greater bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces striking, bee-like flowers with a dark brownish-purple coloration and fine, hair-like structures that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
