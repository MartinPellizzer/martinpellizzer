                    <h1>Orobanche gontscharovii</h1>
<p>Orobanche gontscharovii, commonly known as the Gontscharov's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
