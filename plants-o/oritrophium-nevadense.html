                    <h1>Oritrophium nevadense</h1>
<p>Oritrophium nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra daisy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Oritrophium nevadense plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of the unique flora found in the Sierra Nevada range.</p>
