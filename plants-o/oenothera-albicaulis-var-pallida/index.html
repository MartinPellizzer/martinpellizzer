                            <h1>Oenothera Albicaulis Var. Pallida</h1>
<p>Oenothera albicaulis var. pallida is a striking member of the evening primrose family known for its pale yellow flowers that bloom at dusk. This variant is native to the western United States, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and slender stems make it a unique addition to native plant gardens. The plant is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators like moths and bats. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to other evening primrose species.</p>
