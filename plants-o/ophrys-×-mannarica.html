                    <h1>Ophrys × mannarica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × mannarica, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a plant with unique floral morphology. The orchid's flowers closely resemble female bees, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands across Europe.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its deceptive pollination strategy and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
