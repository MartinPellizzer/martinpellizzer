<p>Orchis quadripunctata subsp.</p>
<p>brancifortii, commonly known as the Branciforti's green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike that bears a single greenish-yellow flower.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky outcrops. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
