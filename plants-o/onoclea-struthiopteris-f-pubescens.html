<p>Onoclea struthiopteris f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern, characterized by its hairy, pubescent fronds.</p>
<p>This fern belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern North America. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive upright, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
