                    <h1>Opuntia duvalioides var. albispina</h1>
<p>Opuntia duvalioides var. albispina, commonly known as the White-spined Pricklypear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are shorter and more white in color compared to other Opuntia species, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
