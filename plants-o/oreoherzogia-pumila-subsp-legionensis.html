<p>Oreoherzogia pumila subsp.</p>
<p>legionensis, commonly known as the dwarf oreoherzogia, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of tubular disc florets, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
