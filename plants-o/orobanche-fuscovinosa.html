                    <h1>Orobanche fuscovinosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche fuscovinosa, commonly known as the dark yellow broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes various members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
