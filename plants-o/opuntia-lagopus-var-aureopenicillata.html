                    <h1>Opuntia lagopus var. aureopenicillata</h1>
<p>Opuntia lagopus var. aureopenicillata, commonly known as the golden-tipped prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into thick, fleshy stems that store water, a key adaptation to its arid environment.</p>
<p>The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
