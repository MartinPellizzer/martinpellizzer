<p>Opuntia blancii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are often used in local cuisines. Opuntia blancii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert ecosystems.</p>
