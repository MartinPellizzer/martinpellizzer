<p>Ozothamnus reflexus, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Ozothamnus reflexus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments.</p>
