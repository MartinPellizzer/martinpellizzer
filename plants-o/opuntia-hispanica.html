                    <h1>Opuntia hispanica</h1>
<p>Opuntia hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia hispanica is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
