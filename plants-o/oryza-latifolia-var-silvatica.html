                    <h1>Oryza latifolia var. silvatica</h1>
<p>Oryza latifolia var. silvatica, commonly known as the broadleaf ricegrass, is a perennial herb native to the moist forest understories of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
