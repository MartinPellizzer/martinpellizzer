                    <h1>Orobanche haenseleri f. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche haenseleri f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants such as legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and striking floral display, it is both ecologically significant and botanically intriguing.</p>
