                    <h1>Ononis repens f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Ononis repens f. caespitosa, commonly known as creeping everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
