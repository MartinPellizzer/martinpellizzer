                    <h1>Oestlundorchis hio</h1>
<p>Oestlundorchis hio, commonly known as the Hio orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific pollinators, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oestlundorchis hio is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
