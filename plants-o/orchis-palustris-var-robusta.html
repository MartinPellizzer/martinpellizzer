<p>Orchis palustris var. robusta, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in bogs or marshes, and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
