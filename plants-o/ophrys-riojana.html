                    <h1>Ophrys riojana</h1>
<p>Ophrys riojana, commonly known as the Rioja orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in open, sunny habitats. Its growth is closely tied to specific soil conditions and microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys riojana is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
