<p>Onoclea sensibilis var. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water clover, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features fronds with broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more rounded leaf lobes compared to the typical form of Onoclea sensibilis.</p>
