<p>Orobanche cooperi subsp.</p>
<p>cooperi, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale, often translucent stem and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This species typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its specialized relationship with host plants.</p>
