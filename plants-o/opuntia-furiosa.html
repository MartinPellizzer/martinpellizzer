                    <h1>Opuntia furiosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia furiosa, commonly known as the fierce prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia furiosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and edible qualities.</p>
