The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the flower's structure mimics the appearance and scent of a female wasp.</p>
