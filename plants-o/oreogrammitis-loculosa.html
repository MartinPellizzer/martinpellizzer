                    <h1>Oreogrammitis loculosa</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis loculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wall-rue, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant typically forms compact, mat-like growths, which help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis loculosa is often found in limestone or calcareous soils, making it a common sight in rocky habitats and along shaded walls.</p>
