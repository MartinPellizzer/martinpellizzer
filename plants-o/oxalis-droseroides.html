                    <h1>Oxalis droseroides</h1>
<p>Oxalis droseroides, commonly known as the sticky oxalis, is a unique plant that combines features of both the oxalis and sundew families.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it a fascinating example of carnivorous plant evolution within the Oxalis genus.</p>
