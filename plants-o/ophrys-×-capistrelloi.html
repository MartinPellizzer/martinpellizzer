                    <h1>Ophrys × capistrelloi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × capistrelloi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Ophrys genus within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys citrina (the yellow bee orchid), resulting in a plant with unique floral characteristics. The flower resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that attracts male bees for pollination. This orchid is typically found in calcareous soils across Europe, particularly in southern France and Italy.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of adaptive evolution and the complexities of hybrid speciation in orchids.</p>
