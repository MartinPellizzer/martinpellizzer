<p>Oncidium leinigii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without harming them.</p>
<p>Oncidium leinigii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
