                    <h1>Oenothera hartwegii var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Oenothera hartwegii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name "pubescens.". The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanism involving a spiral twist.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
