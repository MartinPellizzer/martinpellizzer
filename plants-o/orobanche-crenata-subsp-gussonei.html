<p>Orobanche crenata subsp.</p>
<p>gussonei, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily obtains water and minerals from its host plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in Mediterranean regions, often parasitizing leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecology of its host plants and can sometimes impact agricultural crops.</p>
