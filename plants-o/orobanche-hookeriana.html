                    <h1>Orobanche hookeriana</h1>
<p>Orobanche hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only small, scale-like structures. The plant produces showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically pink, purple, or white. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
