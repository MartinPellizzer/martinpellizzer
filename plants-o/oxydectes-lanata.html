                    <h1>Oxydectes lanata</h1>
<p>Oxydectes lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderworts, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, characterized by its unique carnivorous adaptations.</p>
<p>This plant is native to wetland and marshy environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are covered in dense, velvety hairs that help in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Oxydectes lanata is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also supplementing its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
