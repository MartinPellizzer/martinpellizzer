                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. aristida</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. aristida, commonly known as the slender ricegrass, is a wild rice species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescences and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated rice and its potential for ecological and agricultural applications.</p>
