                    <h1>Onix</h1>
<p>Onix, commonly known as the Iron Pokémon, is a Steel-type Pokémon that is not a real plant but is often associated with rock and mineral formations.</p>
<p>While it is not a botanical species, its appearance is inspired by the jagged, mineral-rich structures found in nature. In the Pokémon world, Onix is depicted as a serpent-like creature made of rock and steel, resembling a fossilized or mineralized organism. Its design reflects the natural formations of caves and mountains, which are often rich in botanical and geological diversity.</p>
<p>Though not a plant, Onix's presence in nature-inspired environments highlights the interplay between geological and botanical elements.</p>
