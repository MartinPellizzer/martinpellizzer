<p>Oxytropis leucantha subsp.</p>
<p>tschukotcensis, commonly known as the Tschukotka locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Russia and Alaska. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
