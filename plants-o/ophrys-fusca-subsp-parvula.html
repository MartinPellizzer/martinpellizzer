<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>parvula, commonly known as the small-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
