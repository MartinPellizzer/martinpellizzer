<p>Ophrys × gauthieri subsp.</p>
<p>lucronii, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
