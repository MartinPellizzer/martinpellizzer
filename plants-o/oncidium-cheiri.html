<p>Oncidium cheiri, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Oncidium cheiri is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
