                    <h1>Ophrys × maimonensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × maimonensis, commonly known as the Maimon orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a complex pattern of yellow and brown markings resembling a bee's body. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are highly specialized, designed to attract male bees through visual mimicry and chemical signals.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its role in pollination dynamics and its unique evolutionary adaptations.</p>
