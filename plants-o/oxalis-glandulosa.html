<p>Oxalis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage and flowers are covered in tiny, glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance.</p>
<p>Oxalis glandulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
