                    <h1>Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. ellipticus</h1>
<p>Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic cranberry, is a botanical variant of the cranberry species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, waxy leaves and small, red, edible berries that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. It has a low-growing habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This form is distinct from the more common Oxycoccus quadripetalus due to its leaf shape and growth pattern.</p>
