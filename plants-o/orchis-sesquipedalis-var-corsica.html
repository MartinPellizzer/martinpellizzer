<p>Orchis sesquipedalis var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single, often pink or purple-colored flower, which is highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
