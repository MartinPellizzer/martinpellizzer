<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>romolinii, commonly known as the Romolini bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
