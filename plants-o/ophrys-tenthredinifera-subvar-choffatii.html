                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. choffatii</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. choffatii, commonly known as the Choffat's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces a single, strikingly colored flower with intricate patterns that serve as a visual mimicry of its pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
