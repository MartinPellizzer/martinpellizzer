                    <h1>Ophrys × gelana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × gelana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its highly specialized flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies, enhancing its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × gelana is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe.</p>
