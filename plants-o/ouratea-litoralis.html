<p>Ouratea litoralis, commonly known as the coastal ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture to help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The coastal ouratea is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to dune stabilization and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
