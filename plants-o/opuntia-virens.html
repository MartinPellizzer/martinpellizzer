                    <h1>Opuntia virens</h1>
<p>Opuntia virens, commonly known as the green prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in small, hairless spines called glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia virens is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure and slow growth rate make it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
