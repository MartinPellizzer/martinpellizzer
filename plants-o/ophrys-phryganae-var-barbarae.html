                    <h1>Ophrys phryganae var. barbarae</h1>
<p>Ophrys phryganae var. barbarae, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
