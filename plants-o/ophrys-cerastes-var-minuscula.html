                    <h1>Ophrys cerastes var. minuscula</h1>
<p>Ophrys cerastes var. minuscula, commonly known as the lesser horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as limestone grasslands. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals that play a crucial role in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
