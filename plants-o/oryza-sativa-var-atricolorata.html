                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. atricolorata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. atricolorata, commonly known as the purple rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its striking purple pigmentation.</p>
<p>This coloration is primarily due to the high concentration of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble pigments responsible for the deep hues in various fruits and vegetables. The plant exhibits typical rice morphology, with slender stems and lanceolate leaves, but its flowers and grains display a unique purple hue. It is cultivated in regions with warm climates and requires a significant amount of water during its growth cycle.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its potential nutritional benefits and use in traditional cuisines.</p>
