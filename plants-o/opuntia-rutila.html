                    <h1>Opuntia rutila</h1>
<p>Opuntia rutila, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia rutila is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in desert conditions.</p>
