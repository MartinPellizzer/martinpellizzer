<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>omegaifera, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
