<p>pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, leafless stems and showy, pale yellow to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing various species of shrubs and herbs. Its flowers are usually arranged in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host plants.</p>
