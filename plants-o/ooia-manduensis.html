<p>Ooia manduensis, commonly known as the Manduensian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ooia manduensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
