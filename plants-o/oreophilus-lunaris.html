                    <h1>Oreophilus lunaris</h1>
<p>Oreophilus lunaris, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest clearings. The plant produces delicate, moon-white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Oreophilus lunaris is closely related to other orchid species in the genus, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms.</p>
