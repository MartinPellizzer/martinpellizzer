                    <h1>Ophiopogon fauriei</h1>
<p>Ophiopogon fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a low-growing mat, often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, contributing to erosion control and habitat for small organisms.</p>
