<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct lip that plays a key role in the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
