                    <h1>Ophrys lesbis var. mandalyana</h1>
<p>Ophrys lesbis var. mandalyana, commonly known as the Mandalyan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns resembling bee wings. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
