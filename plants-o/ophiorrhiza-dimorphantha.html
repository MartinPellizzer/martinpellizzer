<p>Ophiorrhiza dimorphantha, commonly known as the two-leaved marsh plant, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct leaf types on the same plantâ€”one opposite and one alternate. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, adapting to waterlogged soils with its specialized root system. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza dimorphantha plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
