<p>Ophrys arachnites subsp.</p>
<p>holubyana, commonly known as the Holubyan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
