<p>Oliganthes triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered oliganthes, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters.
