                    <h1>Ophrys fuciflora var. cornigera</h1>
<p>Ophrys fuciflora var. cornigera, commonly known as the Cornish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western coast of England.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along rocky shores and cliffs, thriving in coastal environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
