                    <h1>Orchiodes fumatum</h1>
<p>Orchiodes fumatum, commonly known as the smoky orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers with a distinctive white or pale green lip, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, usually in the summer months, and are known for their strong, spicy scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchiodes fumatum is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
