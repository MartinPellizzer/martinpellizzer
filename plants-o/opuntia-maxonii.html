<p>Opuntia maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Opuntia maxonii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cuisines and medicine.</p>
