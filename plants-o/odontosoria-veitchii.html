<p>Odontosoria veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's tooth fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a toothbrush. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates like tree trunks or soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration.</p>
