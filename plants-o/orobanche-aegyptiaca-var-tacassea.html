                    <h1>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. tacassea</h1>
<p>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. tacassea, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants such as legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops, making it both a subject of ecological study and a challenge for farmers.</p>
