                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. minuscula</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. minuscula, commonly known as the small horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
