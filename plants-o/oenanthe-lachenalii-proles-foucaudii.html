                    <h1>Oenanthe lachenalii proles foucaudii</h1>
<p>Oenanthe lachenalii proles foucaudii, commonly known as the Foucaud's water dropwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and pools, often in shaded, rocky substrates. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
