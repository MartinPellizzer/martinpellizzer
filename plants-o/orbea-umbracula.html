<p>Orbea umbracula, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of dark purple to black flowers that resemble orchids. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and sought-after species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orbea umbracula is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
