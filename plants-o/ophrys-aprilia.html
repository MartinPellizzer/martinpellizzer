<p>Ophrys aprilia, commonly known as the spring bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys aprilia is a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of 20 to 40 centimeters.</p>
