                    <h1>Opuntia perrita</h1>
<p>Opuntia perrita, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia perrita is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and culinary uses.</p>
