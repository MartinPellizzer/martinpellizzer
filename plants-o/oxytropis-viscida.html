                    <h1>Oxytropis viscida</h1>
<p>Oxytropis viscida, commonly known as sticky locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oblong legumes as fruits, which contain several seeds. Oxytropis viscida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It is also known for its sticky secretions, which can adhere to the fur of animals and may have ecological implications for seed dispersal.</p>
