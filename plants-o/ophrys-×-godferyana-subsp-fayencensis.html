<p>Ophrys × godferyana subsp.</p>
<p>fayencensis, commonly known as the Fayencian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
