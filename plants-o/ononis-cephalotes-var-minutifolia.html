<p>Ononis cephalotes var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common sight in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other varieties within the Ononis genus.</p>
