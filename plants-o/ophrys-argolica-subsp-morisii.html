<p>Ophrys argolica subsp.</p>
<p>morisii, commonly known as the Moris' bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions such as Greece and Italy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
