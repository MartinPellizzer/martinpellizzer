<p>[WRONG START] Obernna uniflora subsp.</p>
<p>islandica, commonly known as the island bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain remote islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
