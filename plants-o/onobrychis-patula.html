<p>Onobrychis patula, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings.</p>
