<p>Oenothera albicaulis f. erosa, commonly known as the erosa evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more elongated, erosa (rough) leaf surfaces compared to the typical form.</p>
