                    <h1>Olea europaea var. cerasiformis</h1>
<p>Olea europaea var. cerasiformis, commonly known as the cherry-shaped olive, is a unique variant of the olive tree characterized by its distinctive, rounded, cherry-like fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and is valued for its ornamental appeal due to its compact growth habit and showy fruit clusters. The leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant red or orange berries that appear in late summer. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value rather than for oil production.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal and urban landscapes.</p>
