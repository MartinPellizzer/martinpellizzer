                    <h1>Orobanche hederae</h1>
<p>Orobanche hederae, commonly known as the ivy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on host plants for survival. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. It commonly parasitizes ivy (Hedera species) and other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants and is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
