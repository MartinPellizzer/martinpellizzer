                    <h1>Opuntia longispina var. flavidispina</h1>
<p>Opuntia longispina var. flavidispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations include water storage in its thick stems and a reduced leaf structure to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
