<p>Odosicyos, commonly known as the desert date, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Odosicyos is also valued for its latex, which has been traditionally used in various applications.</p>
