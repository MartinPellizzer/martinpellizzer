                    <h1>Ophrys pharia</h1>
<p>Ophrys pharia, commonly known as the Pharia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys pharia is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
