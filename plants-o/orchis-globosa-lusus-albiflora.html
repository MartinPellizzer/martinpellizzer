                    <h1>Orchis globosa lusus albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis globosa lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered globular orchid, is a rare and striking species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, globular-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces showy, white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
