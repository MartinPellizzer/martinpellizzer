                    <h1>Orobanche foetida var. subgracilis</h1>
<p>Orobanche foetida var. subgracilis, commonly known as the stinkweed or foul-smelling broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are specialized for attaching to host roots, forming haustoria that extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and strong, unpleasant odor, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
