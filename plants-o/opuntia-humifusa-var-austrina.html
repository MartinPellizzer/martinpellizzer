                    <h1>Opuntia humifusa var. austrina</h1>
<p>Opuntia humifusa var. austrina, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to reddish in color, covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
