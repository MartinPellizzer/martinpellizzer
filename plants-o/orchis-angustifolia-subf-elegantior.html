<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>elegantior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
