                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden rice or the auriculate rice, is a variant of the common rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-like) structures on the leaf sheaths, which give it its unique appearance. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and genetic research.</p>
