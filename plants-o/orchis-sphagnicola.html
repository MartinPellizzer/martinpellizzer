                    <h1>Orchis sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Orchis sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in peat bogs across northern Europe and parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in dense, moist habitats with acidic conditions, often forming part of a unique and fragile ecosystem. Its flowers are usually pale purple or pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Orchis sphagnicola is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its habitat.</p>
