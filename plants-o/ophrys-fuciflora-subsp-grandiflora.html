<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
