                    <h1>Orobanche hermonis</h1>
<p>Orobanche hermonis, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves, and its root system consists of haustoria that attach to the roots of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
