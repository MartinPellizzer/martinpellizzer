The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or humid montane regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
