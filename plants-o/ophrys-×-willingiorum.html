                    <h1>Ophrys × willingiorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × willingiorum, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>This orchid is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation and pollination mimicry in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
