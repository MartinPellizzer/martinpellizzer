                    <h1>Osbeckia cupularis</h1>
<p>Osbeckia cupularis, commonly known as the cupular cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cup-like structures, giving it its specific epithet "cupularis.". Osbeckia cupularis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays a role in providing habitat and forage for various arctic and alpine wildlife species.</p>
