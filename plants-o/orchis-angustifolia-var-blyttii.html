The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaved orchid is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
