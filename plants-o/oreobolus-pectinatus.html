                    <h1>Oreobolus pectinatus</h1>
<p>Oreobolus pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy soils. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across harsh environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Oreobolus pectinatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
