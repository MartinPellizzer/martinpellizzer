<p>Ormocarpum buchholzii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
