<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
