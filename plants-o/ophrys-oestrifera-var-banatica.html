                    <h1>Ophrys oestrifera var. banatica</h1>
<p>Ophrys oestrifera var. banatica, commonly known as the Banat Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers emit a scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
