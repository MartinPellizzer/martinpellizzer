<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>integra, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. This species is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctively shaped lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>The subspecies integra is distinguished by its more elongated and less hairy flowers compared to other subspecies of Ophrys insectifera.</p>
