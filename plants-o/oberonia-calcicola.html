                    <h1>Oberonia calcicola</h1>
<p>Oberonia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the limestone hills of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires specific microhabitats for successful growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia calcicola is considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
