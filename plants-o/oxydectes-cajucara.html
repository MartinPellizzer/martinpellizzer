                    <h1>Oxydectes cajucara</h1>
<p>Oxydectes cajucara, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark blue to black berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
