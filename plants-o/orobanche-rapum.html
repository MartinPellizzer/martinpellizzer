                <h1>Orobanche rapum</h1>
<p>Orobanche rapum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it a challenging species to manage.</p>
