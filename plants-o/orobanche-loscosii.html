                    <h1>Orobanche loscosii</h1>
<p>Orobanche loscosii, commonly known as the Spanish broom or broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes such as Vicia and Medicago. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
