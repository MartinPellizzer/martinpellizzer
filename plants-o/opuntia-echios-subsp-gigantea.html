<p>Opuntia echios subsp.</p>
<p>gigantea, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has a unique ability to photosynthesize through its stems, which are covered in spines and are modified leaves.</p>
