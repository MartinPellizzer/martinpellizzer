                    <h1>Orchis longifolia</h1>
<p>Orchis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed along the stem, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Orchis longifolia is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and moist grasslands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
