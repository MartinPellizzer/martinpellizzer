                    <h1>Origanum caespititium</h1>
<p>Origanum caespititium, commonly known as woolly oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other members of the Lamiaceae family.</p>
