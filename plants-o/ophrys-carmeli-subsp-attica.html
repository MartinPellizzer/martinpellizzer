<p>Ophrys carmeli subsp.</p>
<p>attica, commonly known as the Attic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, sun-exposed environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct, elongated spur that houses the nectar.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
