<p>Opuntia pentlandii var. rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
