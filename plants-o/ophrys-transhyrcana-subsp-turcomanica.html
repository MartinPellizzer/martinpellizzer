<p>Ophrys transhyrcana subsp.</p>
<p>turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which aids in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
