                    <h1>Oreobatus</h1>
<p>Oreobatus, commonly known as the Arizona bark scorpion, is a venomous arachnid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>While not a plant, it is often confused with botanical terms due to its name, which does not refer to a plant species. The name "Oreobatus" is derived from Greek, meaning "mountain biter," reflecting its habitat and behavior. It is important to clarify that Oreobatus is an arachnid, not a plant, and thus has no botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>This clarification is essential to avoid confusion with actual plant species.</p>
