<p>Ophrys × gumprechtii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>enobarbia, commonly known as the Enobarbus bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of crossbreeding between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Ophrys genus.</p>
