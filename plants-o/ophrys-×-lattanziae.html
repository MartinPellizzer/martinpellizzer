                    <h1>Ophrys × lattanziae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lattanziae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This plant is native to parts of southern Europe, particularly in regions where its parent species overlap. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its ability to produce fertile offspring, making it an important subject in the study of plant hybridization and speciation.</p>
