                    <h1>Ophrys sicula var. liveranii</h1>
<p>Ophrys sicula var. liveranii, commonly known as the Liverani's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
