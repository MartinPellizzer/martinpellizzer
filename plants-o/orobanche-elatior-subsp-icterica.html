<p>Orobanche elatior subsp.</p>
<p>icterica, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and slender, branching stems.</p>
<p>This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle involves producing small, inconspicuous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
