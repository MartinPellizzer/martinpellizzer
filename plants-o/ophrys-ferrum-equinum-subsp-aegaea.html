<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>aegaea, commonly known as the Aegadian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
