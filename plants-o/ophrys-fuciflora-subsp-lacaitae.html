<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>lacaitae, commonly known as the lacaita orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
