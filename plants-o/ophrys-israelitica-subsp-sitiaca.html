<p>Ophrys israelitica subsp.</p>
<p>sitiaca, commonly known as the Sitia Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
