                    <h1>Oxydectes tomentella</h1>
<p>Oxydectes tomentella, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique morphology, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
