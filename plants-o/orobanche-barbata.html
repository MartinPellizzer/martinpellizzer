                    <h1>Orobanche barbata</h1>
<p>Orobanche barbata, commonly known as the barbed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its specialized root system for attachment to host roots. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers, typically in clusters, and has a short, erect stem. It is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, often growing in disturbed soils or on cultivated crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops, making it a subject of ecological and agricultural interest.</p>
