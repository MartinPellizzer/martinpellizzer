<p>Othonna vestita, commonly known as the silver leaf othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage that is covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Othonna vestita is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
