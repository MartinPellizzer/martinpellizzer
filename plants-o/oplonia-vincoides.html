                    <h1>Oplonia vincoides</h1>
<p>Oplonia vincoides, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a spreading growth habit with slender, fleshy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Oplonia vincoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
