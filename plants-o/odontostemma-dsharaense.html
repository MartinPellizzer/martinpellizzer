<p>Odontostemma dsharaense, commonly known as the Dshara mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features a rhizomatous root system and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed around the stem. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
