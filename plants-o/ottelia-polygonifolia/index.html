                            <h1>Ottelia Polygonifolia</h1>
<p>Water lettuce, scientifically known as Ottelia polygonifolia, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients efficiently while providing shelter for aquatic life. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
