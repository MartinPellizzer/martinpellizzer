                    <h1>Orobanche uniflora var. typica</h1>
<p>Orobanche uniflora var. typica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces a single flower per stem, which is usually pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
