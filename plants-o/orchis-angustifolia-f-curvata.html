<p>Orchis angustifolia f. curvata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, upright flower spike that produces a single, pale yellow to greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
