<p>Oligothrix xyridopsis, commonly known as the marsh thread alga, is a filamentous green alga that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, unbranched filaments composed of elongated cells. This species typically grows in moist soils, wetlands, and along the margins of ponds and lakes. Its simple morphology allows it to colonize a variety of substrates, including decaying vegetation and soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Oligothrix xyridopsis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling within aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
