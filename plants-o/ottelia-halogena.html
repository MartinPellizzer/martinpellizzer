                    <h1>Ottelia halogena</h1>
<p>Ottelia halogena, commonly known as the salt marsh water starwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a semi-aquatic species that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are usually submerged or floating, and its small, star-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink. Ottelia halogena has adapted to high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
