<p>Orobanche brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are highly viable and can remain dormant in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Orobanche brasiliensis is native to South America and is considered a significant weed in agricultural settings.</p>
