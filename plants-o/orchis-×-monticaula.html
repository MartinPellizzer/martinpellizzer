                    <h1>Orchis × monticaula</h1>
<p>Orchis × monticaula, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude environments.</p>
