<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>cornutula, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinct horn-shaped projection on the lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several European countries.</p>
