<p>Ophrys sphegodes nothosubsp.</p>
<p>jeanpertii, commonly known as the bee orchid variant, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs during late spring to early summer, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
