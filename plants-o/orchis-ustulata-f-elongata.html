                    <h1>Orchis ustulata f. elongata</h1>
<p>Orchis ustulata f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike of pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique morphology adapted to its wetland environment. Its flowers are typically small and lack the showy petals of many other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
