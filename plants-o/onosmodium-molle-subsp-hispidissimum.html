<p>Onosmodium molle subsp.</p>
<p>hispidissimum, commonly known as the roughleaf onosmodium, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its woody stems are often branched and can become woody with age, providing structural support.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
