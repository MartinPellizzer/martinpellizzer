                    <h1>Orobanche schugnanica</h1>
<p>Orobanche schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root contact with host species such as Astragalus and Hedera. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in clusters. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
