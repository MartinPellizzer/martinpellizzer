                    <h1>Obione orbicularis</h1>
<p>Obione orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a rounded, orb-like structure. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is typical of lichens. Its growth is often found on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The morphology and chemical composition of Obione orbicularis make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy.</p>
