<p>Octoclinis juniperoides, commonly known as the rock juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, displaying dense, scale-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berry-like cones that are edible for some bird species. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Octoclinis juniperoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
