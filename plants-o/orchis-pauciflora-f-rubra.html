                    <h1>Orchis pauciflora f. rubra</h1>
<p>Orchis pauciflora f. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered scarce orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the scarce orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy red or reddish-purple flower spike. This orchid is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the British Isles, where it thrives in calcareous grasslands. The flower has a distinctive, hooded structure with a spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>
