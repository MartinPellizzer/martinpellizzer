                    <h1>Ophioglossum lusoafricanum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum lusoafricanum, commonly known as the African adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporangium, which is a distinctive feature among the Ophioglossaceae family. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are often hidden within the leaf sheaths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
