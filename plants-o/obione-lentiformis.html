                    <h1>Obione lentiformis</h1>
<p>Obione lentiformis, commonly known as the lens-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that forms a lens-shaped structure, typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a structure called a thallus, which absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Obione lentiformis is often found in temperate regions and plays a minor role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
