                    <h1>Octella fascicularis</h1>
<p>Octella fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often clustered around the base of the plant, giving it its species name "fascicularis.".</p>
<p>Octella fascicularis is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
