<p>Oncidium galianoi, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a fan shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions.</p>
<p>Oncidium galianoi prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting mix for optimal growth.</p>
