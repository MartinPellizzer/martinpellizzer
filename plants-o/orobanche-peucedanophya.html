                    <h1>Orobanche peucedanophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche peucedanophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. It typically parasitizes members of the Apiaceae family, such as carrots and parsley, weakening the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
