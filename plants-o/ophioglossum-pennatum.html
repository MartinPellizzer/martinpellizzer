<p>Ophioglossum pennatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that supports its upright growth habit. Its leaves are typically large, with a leathery texture and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum pennatum is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
