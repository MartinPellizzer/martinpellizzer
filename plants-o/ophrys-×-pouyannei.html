                    <h1>Ophrys × pouyannei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pouyannei, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the crossbreeding of Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic the appearance of female bees, a trait known as sexual deception. This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a slender stem, narrow leaves, and a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum.</p>
