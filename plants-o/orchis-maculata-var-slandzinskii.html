                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. slandzinskii</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. slandzinskii, commonly known as the Slandzinskii spotted orchid, is a rare and endemic variety of the spotted orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white spotted flowers, which bloom in late spring. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
