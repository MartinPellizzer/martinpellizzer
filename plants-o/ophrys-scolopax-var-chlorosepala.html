<p>Ophrys scolopax var. chlorosepala, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a specific microclimate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
