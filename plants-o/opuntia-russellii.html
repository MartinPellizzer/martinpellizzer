                    <h1>Opuntia russellii</h1>
<p>Opuntia russellii, commonly known as Russell's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia russellii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
