<p>Oxytropis nigrescens subsp.</p>
<p>arctobia, commonly known as the Alaska locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and tundra environments. It has small, compound leaves with stiff, hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
