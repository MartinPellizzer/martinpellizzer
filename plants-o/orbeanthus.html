                    <h1>Orbeanthus</h1>
<p>Orbeanthus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has deep roots that allow it to survive in dry, sandy soils, making it well-adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Orbeanthus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
