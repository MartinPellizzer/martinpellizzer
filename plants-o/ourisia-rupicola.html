<p>Ourisia rupicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
