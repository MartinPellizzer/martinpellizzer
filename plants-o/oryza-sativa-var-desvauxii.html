                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. desvauxii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. desvauxii, commonly known as the dwarf rice variety, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced plant height.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered panicles of rice grains. Its genome has been studied for its potential in developing disease-resistant and high-yield rice cultivars.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
