<p>Opuntia spinalba, commonly known as the spineless prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, soft spines called glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia spinalba is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine.</p>
