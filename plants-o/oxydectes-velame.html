<p>Oxydectes velame, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Oxydectes velame is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
