The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually dark brown or black, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
