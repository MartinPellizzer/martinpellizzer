                    <h1>Orchis hatagirea var. schlaginweitii</h1>
<p>Orchis hatagirea var. schlaginweitii, commonly known as the Himalayan tawny orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tawny-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
