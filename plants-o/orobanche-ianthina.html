                    <h1>Orobanche ianthina</h1>
<p>Orobanche ianthina, commonly known as the purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems, with a smooth, often purple or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops.</p>
