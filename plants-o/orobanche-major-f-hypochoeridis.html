                    <h1>Orobanche major f. hypochoeridis</h1>
<p>Orobanche major f. hypochoeridis, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. This species typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host plant.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich environments.</p>
