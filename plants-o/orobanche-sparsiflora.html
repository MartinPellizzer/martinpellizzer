                    <h1>Orobanche sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on species of the family Chenopodiaceae. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and it has a highly reduced structure with no true leaves. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its persistence in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
