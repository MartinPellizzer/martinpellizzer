                            <h1>Oenothera Elata Var. Hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Hairy evening primrose, scientifically known as Oenothera elata var. hirsutissima, is a striking wildflower native to the central and western United States. This plant is characterized by its hairy stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in sandy areas. The species is closely related to other evening primroses, sharing similar ecological roles and pollination strategies. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is both ecologically significant and a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
