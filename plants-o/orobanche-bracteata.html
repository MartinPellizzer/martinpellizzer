                    <h1>Orobanche bracteata</h1>
<p>Orobanche bracteata, commonly known as the bractless broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to study in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
