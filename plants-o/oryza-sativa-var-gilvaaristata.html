                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. gilvaaristata</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. gilvaaristata, commonly known as the pale rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated subspecies of rice.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white grain color, which distinguishes it from the more common brown or white rice varieties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, similar to other rice species, and requires a warm, humid climate with ample water for cultivation. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a panicle inflorescence that bears small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>While not widely used for commercial rice production, it holds significance in botanical studies and traditional agriculture.</p>
