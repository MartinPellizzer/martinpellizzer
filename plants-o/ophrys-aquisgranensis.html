                    <h1>Ophrys aquisgranensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys aquisgranensis, commonly known as the Aquilegia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the limestone-rich regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are predominantly green with intricate patterns, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ophrys aquisgranensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
