                    <h1>Oxydectes polyandra</h1>
<p>Oxydectes polyandra, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
