                    <h1>Ophrys lycomedis</h1>
<p>Ophrys lycomedis, commonly known as the Lycomedes bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys lycomedis is a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
