                    <h1>Oxalis inconspicua</h1>
<p>Oxalis inconspicua, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of wood sorrel, with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a modest yet elegant touch to its foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf structure and low profile, it is well adapted to avoid notice, hence its common name.</p>
