                    <h1>Ophrys picta var. sphegifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys picta var. sphegifera, commonly known as the painted bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique blend of visual and chemical cues to enhance pollination success.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, making it an important subject in the study of plant-animal interactions.</p>
