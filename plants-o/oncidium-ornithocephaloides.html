<p>Oncidium ornithocephaloides, commonly known as the bird's head orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns resembling bird heads. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Oncidium ornithocephaloides requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
