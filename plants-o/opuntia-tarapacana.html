                    <h1>Opuntia tarapacana</h1>
<p>Opuntia tarapacana, commonly known as the "Cristalina" or "Lithops Opuntia," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Chile and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia tarapacana is also notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with intense sunlight and low precipitation.</p>
