                    <h1>Orchis wilmsii</h1>
<p>Orchis wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilms' orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in Austria and Switzerland. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred lip and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis wilmsii is considered a protected species in several European countries.</p>
