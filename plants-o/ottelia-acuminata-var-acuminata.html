<p>Ottelia acuminata var. acuminata, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom above the water. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ottelia acuminata var. acuminata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes indicate eutrophication.</p>
