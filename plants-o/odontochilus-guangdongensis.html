                    <h1>Odontochilus guangdongensis</h1>
<p>Odontochilus guangdongensis, commonly known as Guangdong toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
