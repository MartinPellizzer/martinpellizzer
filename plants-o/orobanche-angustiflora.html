                    <h1>Orobanche angustiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its stemless, leafless appearance with clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of its host, such as various species of Astragalus, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
