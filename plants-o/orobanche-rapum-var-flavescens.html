                    <h1>Orobanche rapum var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Orobanche rapum var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow common broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes crops like sugar beets and carrots. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and establishing a connection through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in cultivated plants.</p>
