                    <h1>Ophrys volucris</h1>
<p>Ophrys volucris, commonly known as the honeybee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which closely resembles a female honeybee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to blackish coloration and a distinctive, hairy labellum. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ophrys volucris thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
