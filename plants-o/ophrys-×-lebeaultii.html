<p>Ophrys × lebeaultii, commonly known as the Lebeault's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to mimic pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique pollination mechanism and hybrid origin.</p>
