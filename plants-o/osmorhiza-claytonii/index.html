                            <h1>Osmorhiza Claytonii</h1>
<p>Clayton's boneset, scientifically known as Osmorhiza claytonii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms a unique ecological niche. The plant is named for its brittle, bone-like stems and its historical use in traditional medicine. Despite its beauty and medicinal potential, it faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this endangered species for future generations.</p>
