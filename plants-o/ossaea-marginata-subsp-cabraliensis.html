<p>Ossaea marginata subsp.</p>
<p>cabraliensis, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula lichen, is a rare and specialized plant species endemic to the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic composite organism formed by a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in humid, shaded microhabitats such as rock faces and shaded crevices. Its botanical structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it exhibits a crust-like growth form.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological specificity and is considered an indicator of undisturbed, moist environments.</p>
