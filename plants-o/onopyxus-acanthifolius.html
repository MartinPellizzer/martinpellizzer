                    <h1>Onopyxus acanthifolius</h1>
<p>Onopyxus acanthifolius, commonly known as the spiny-leaved onopyxus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a woody base with a dense cluster of fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
