                    <h1>Osmundastrum × bipinnatum</h1>
<p>Osmundastrum × bipinnatum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Osmundastrum cinnamomeum and Osmunda regalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The fronds are composed of numerous small pinnae, which are further divided into pinnules, creating a complex, lacy appearance. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
