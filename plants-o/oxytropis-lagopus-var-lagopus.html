                    <h1>Oxytropis lagopus var. lagopus</h1>
<p>Oxytropis lagopus var. lagopus, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant has small, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>The snow lotus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
