                    <h1>Oenothera demareei</h1>
<p>Oenothera demareei, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera demareei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
