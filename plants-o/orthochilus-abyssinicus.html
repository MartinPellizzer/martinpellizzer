<p>Orthochilus abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
