                    <h1>Orobanche punctata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Orobanche punctata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and brassica families.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist herbivore.</p>
