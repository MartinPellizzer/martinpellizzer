                    <h1>Olax</h1>
<p>Olax, commonly known as the mistletoe plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Olax species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the branches of hardwood trees. Their small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers are adapted for survival in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Some species of Olax are used in traditional medicine, though their ecological impact on host trees can be significant.</p>
