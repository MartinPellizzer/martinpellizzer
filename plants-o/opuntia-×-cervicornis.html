                    <h1>Opuntia × cervicornis</h1>
<p>Opuntia × cervicornis, commonly known as the coast prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the coastal regions of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia × cervicornis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
