<p>Orchis papilionacea subsp.</p>
<p>alibertis, commonly known as the Alibert's butterfly orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive butterfly-shaped flowers, which are typically pale pink to white in color.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms during the spring and early summer, producing showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered rare and is protected in several regions.</p>
