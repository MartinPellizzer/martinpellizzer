                    <h1>Opuntia × neoarbuscula</h1>
<p>Opuntia × neoarbuscula, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flattened, stem-like structures called cladodes, which are often used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by fleshy, edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia × neoarbuscula is a hybrid between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia polyacantha, resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
