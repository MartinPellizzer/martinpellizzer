<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>olympiadae, commonly known as the Olympic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, bee-like labellum that attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
