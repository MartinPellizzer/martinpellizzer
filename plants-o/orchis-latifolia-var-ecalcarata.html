<p>Orchis latifolia var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid variant with a spurred lip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spur at the base of the lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected in conservation areas.</p>
