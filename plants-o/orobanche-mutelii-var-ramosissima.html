                    <h1>Orobanche mutelii var. ramosissima</h1>
<p>Orobanche mutelii var. ramosissima, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces numerous small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its stems are often branched and hairy. It is native to various regions in Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed.</p>
