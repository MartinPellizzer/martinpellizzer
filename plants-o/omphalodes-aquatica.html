                    <h1>Omphalodes aquatica</h1>
<p>Omphalodes aquatica, commonly known as water-leaf or water scurf, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in moist conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, allowing it to thrive in shallow water or damp soil.</p>
<p>Omphalodes aquatica is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other wetland areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
