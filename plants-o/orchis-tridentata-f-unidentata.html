<p>Orchis tridentata f. unidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its morphology includes a short, stout rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
