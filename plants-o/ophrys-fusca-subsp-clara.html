<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>clara, commonly known as the clear bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which includes a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking combination of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
