                    <h1>Ophrys albiflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys albiflora, commonly known as the white bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like floral structure, which features a white, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, white or pale yellow coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Ophrys albiflora is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
