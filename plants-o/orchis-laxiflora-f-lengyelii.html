                    <h1>Orchis laxiflora f. lengyelii</h1>
<p>Orchis laxiflora f. lengyelii, commonly known as the Lengyel's loose-flowered orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and relatively large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces pendulous, violet or purple flowers with a unique, elongated lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
