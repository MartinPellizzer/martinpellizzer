<p>Ononis repens subsp.</p>
<p>caduca, commonly known as the brittle restharrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
