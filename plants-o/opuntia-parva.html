                    <h1>Opuntia parva</h1>
<p>Opuntia parva, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a small cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia parva is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates.</p>
