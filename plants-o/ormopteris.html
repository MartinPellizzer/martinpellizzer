                    <h1>Ormopteris</h1>
<p>Ormopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their robust, leathery fronds and are typically found in rocky or calcareous soils. Ormopteris species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Ormopteris spinulosa, which is known for its distinctive spore-bearing structures.</p>
