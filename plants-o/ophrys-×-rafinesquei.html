                    <h1>Ophrys × rafinesquei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, with a vivid yellow and brown patterned lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are often arranged in dense spikes and bloom during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its unique pollination strategy and is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
