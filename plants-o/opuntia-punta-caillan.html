                    <h1>Opuntia punta-caillan</h1>
<p>Opuntia punta-caillan, commonly known as the Caillan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stems, adapting to the arid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Opuntia punta-caillan plays a role in local ecosystems and is also cultivated for ornamental and agricultural purposes.</p>
