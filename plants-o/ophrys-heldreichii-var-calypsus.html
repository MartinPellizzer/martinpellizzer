                    <h1>Ophrys heldreichii var. calypsus</h1>
<p>Ophrys heldreichii var. calypsus, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it forms a compact rosette of broad, waxy leaves. Its flowers are usually a striking combination of brown, yellow, and green, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
