                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. jorhatica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. jorhatica, commonly known as the Jorhat rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, slender grains and is typically grown in upland conditions with moderate rainfall. This variety is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle inflorescence with small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's genome is similar to other rice varieties, but it exhibits unique genetic markers that distinguish it from common rice types.</p>
