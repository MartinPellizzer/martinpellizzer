                    <h1>Octomeria pumila</h1>
<p>Octomeria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf octomeria, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Octomeria pumila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
