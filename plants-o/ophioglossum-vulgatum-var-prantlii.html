                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. prantlii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. prantlii, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features a long, narrow sterile frond with a broad, tongue-like leaf at the base, which is the most prominent feature of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is native to North America and is considered a rare and ancient fern species with a primitive evolutionary structure.</p>
