                    <h1>Orobanche uitenhagensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche uitenhagensis, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
