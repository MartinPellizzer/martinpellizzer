<p>Oncidium stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in varying environmental conditions. Its leaves are strap-like and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncidium stenopetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
