                    <h1>Ophrys × inceburumensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × inceburumensis, commonly known as the Inceburum orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to facilitate pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific regions of Europe, where it plays a unique role in local ecosystems.</p>
