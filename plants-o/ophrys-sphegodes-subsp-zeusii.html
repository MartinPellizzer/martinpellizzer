<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>zeusii, commonly known as the Zeus bee orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate floral mimicry. This orchid produces a single, showy flower that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, erect stem.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and specialized pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and ecology.</p>
