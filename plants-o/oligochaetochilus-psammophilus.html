                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus psammophilus</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
