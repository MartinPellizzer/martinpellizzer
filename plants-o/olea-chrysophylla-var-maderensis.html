                    <h1>Olea chrysophylla var. maderensis</h1>
<p>Olea chrysophylla var. maderensis, commonly known as the Maderan olive, is a rare variant of the olive tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive golden-yellow hue, which sets it apart from other olive species. The plant thrives in coastal and volcanic soils, often found in the higher elevations of Tenerife. Its small, fragrant flowers give way to olive fruits that are typically smaller and more bitter than those of common olive varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
