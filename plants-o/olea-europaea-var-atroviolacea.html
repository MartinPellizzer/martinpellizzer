                    <h1>Olea europaea var. atroviolacea</h1>
<p>Olea europaea var. atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violaceoak, is a rare and ornamental variant of the olive tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its typical olive-green leaves. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible olives, though it is primarily cultivated for its unique aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often found in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections.</p>
