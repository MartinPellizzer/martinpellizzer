                    <h1>Ophrys × adelphica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × adelphica, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid, resulting in a blend of traits from both parents. The plant is known for its intricate floral morphology, particularly its labellum, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinct three-lobed structure that enhances its mimicry and pollination success.</p>
