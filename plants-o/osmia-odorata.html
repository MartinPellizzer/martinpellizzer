                    <h1>Osmia odorata</h1>
<p>Osmia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, metallic-blue body and is often seen pollinating a wide range of flowering plants. The female constructs its nest in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities, where it lays eggs and provisions them with pollen. Osmia odorata plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the reproduction of both wild and cultivated plants.</p>
<p>Its preference for early-flowering plants makes it an important pollinator in spring ecosystems.</p>
