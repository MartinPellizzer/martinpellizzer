<p>Otanthus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central yellow disk, which are typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
