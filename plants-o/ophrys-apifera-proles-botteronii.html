                    <h1>Ophrys apifera proles botteronii</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera proles botteronii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking Mediterranean orchid species characterized by its specialized floral structure.</p>
<p>The plant features a single, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The orchid has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single erect stem with a single flower.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique mimicry and role in pollination dynamics within its ecosystem.</p>
