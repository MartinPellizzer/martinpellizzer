<p>Orcuttia mucronata, commonly known as the San Diego horned lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the coastal sage scrub habitats of Southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, club-shaped seed pods. It is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orcuttia mucronata is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
