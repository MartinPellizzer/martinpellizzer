                    <h1>Orobanche fasciculata f. lutea</h1>
<p>Orobanche fasciculata f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which contribute to its common name. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, often emerging in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
