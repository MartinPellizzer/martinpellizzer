<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>botteronii, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its highly specialized floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually yellow with brown markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
