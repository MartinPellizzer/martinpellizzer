The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often found in woodland or heathland environments. Its flowers display a distinctive two-line pattern on the lip, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its specialized symbiotic relationship with specific pollinators, highlighting its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
