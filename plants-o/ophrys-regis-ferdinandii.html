                    <h1>Ophrys regis-ferdinandii</h1>
<p>Ophrys regis-ferdinandii, commonly known as the King Ferdinand's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, orange, and brown, mimicking the appearance of a bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys regis-ferdinandii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity.</p>
