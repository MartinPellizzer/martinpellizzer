                    <h1>Ophrys × samiotissa</h1>
<p>Ophrys × samiotissa, commonly known as the Samiotissa bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys scolopendria (the bee orchid of the eastern Mediterranean).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions such as southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>Ophrys × samiotissa is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
