<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>guimaraesii, commonly known as the Guimar√£es bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Portugal. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, typically in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
