                    <h1>Ophioglossum pycnostichum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum pycnostichum, commonly known as the dense-stalked adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble a tongue, with a central vein running along the length of the blade. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, club-like formation at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
