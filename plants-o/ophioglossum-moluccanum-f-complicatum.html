                    <h1>Ophioglossum moluccanum f. complicatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum moluccanum f. complicatum, commonly known as the Moluccan adder's mouth fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick rhizome with a single, large, leathery, ovate leaf that is often deeply divided into complex lobes. The leaf blade is typically dark green and has a rough, textured surface, contributing to its striking appearance. This fern is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly the Molucca Islands, and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
