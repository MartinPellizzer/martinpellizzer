<p>Oplismenus hirtellus subsp.</p>
<p>psilostachys, commonly known as narrowleaf buttonweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
