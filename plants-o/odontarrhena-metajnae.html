<p>Odontarrhena metajnae, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal wild orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, humus-filled soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
