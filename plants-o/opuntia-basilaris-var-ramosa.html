                    <h1>Opuntia basilaris var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia basilaris var. ramosa, commonly known as the Apache prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions.</p>
