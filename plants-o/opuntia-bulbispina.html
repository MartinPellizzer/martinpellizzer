<p>Opuntia bulbispina, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems and sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia bulbispina is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures.</p>
