                    <h1>Orchis papilionacea f. balcanica</h1>
<p>Orchis papilionacea f. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan butterfly orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a butterfly-like blossom with a prominent lip and spurred column. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a distinctively shaped labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
