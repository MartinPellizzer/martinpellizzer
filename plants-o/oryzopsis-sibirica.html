<p>Oryzopsis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian millet, is a grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and other northern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain minute grains, which are adapted for survival in harsh environmental conditions. Oryzopsis sibirica is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native ecosystems.</p>
