<p>Ornithogalum xanthocodon, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
