                    <h1>Oberonia hynniewtaii</h1>
<p>Oberonia hynniewtaii, commonly known as the Hynniewtaii orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Eastern Himalayas, particularly in the state of Manipur, India.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia hynniewtaii is considered vulnerable and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
