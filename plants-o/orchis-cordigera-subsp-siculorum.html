<p>Orchis cordigera subsp.</p>
<p>siculorum, commonly known as the Sicilian heart-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
