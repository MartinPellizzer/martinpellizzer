                    <h1>Orobanche haenseleri</h1>
<p>Orobanche haenseleri, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
