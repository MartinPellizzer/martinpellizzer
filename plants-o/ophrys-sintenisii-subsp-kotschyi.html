<p>Ophrys sintenisii subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like labellum and sepals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
