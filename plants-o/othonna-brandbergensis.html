                    <h1>Othonna brandbergensis</h1>
<p>Othonna brandbergensis, commonly known as Brandberg othonna, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and southern Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Othonna brandbergensis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found growing on cliffs and outcrops in its native habitat.</p>
