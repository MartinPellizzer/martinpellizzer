                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. attica</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. attica, commonly known as the Attic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
