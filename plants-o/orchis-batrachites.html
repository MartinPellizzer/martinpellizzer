<p>Orchis batrachites, commonly known as the frog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of violet-blue flowers that resemble frogs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often forming colonies in suitable environments.</p>
