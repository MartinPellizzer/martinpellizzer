<p>Onobrychis citrinoides, commonly known as yellow burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment.</p>
