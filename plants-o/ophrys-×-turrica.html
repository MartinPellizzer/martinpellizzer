                    <h1>Ophrys × turrica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × turrica, commonly known as the Turkish bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in sunny meadows or forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of a dense spike of showy, hooded flowers.</p>
<p>This orchid is a fascinating example of floral mimicry in the plant kingdom.</p>
