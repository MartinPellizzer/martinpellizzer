<p>Oreocarya bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are leathery and dark green.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocarya bakeri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
