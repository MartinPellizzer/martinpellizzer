<p>Ophrys inversa, commonly known as the inverted bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Ophrys inversa is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
