                    <h1>Ophrys orphanidea</h1>
<p>Ophrys orphanidea, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Balkans, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys orphanidea is considered vulnerable and is protected in several countries.</p>
