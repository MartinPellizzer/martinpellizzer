<p>Orobanche gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>deludens, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often seen growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an ecologically significant but often overlooked component of its habitat.</p>
