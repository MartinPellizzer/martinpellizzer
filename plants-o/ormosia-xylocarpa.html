                    <h1>Ormosia xylocarpa</h1>
<p>Ormosia xylocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-barked ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, often fissured bark that ranges from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its durability, the wood is valued for construction and furniture, though the species is also of ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
