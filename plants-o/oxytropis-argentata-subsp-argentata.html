<p>Oxytropis argentata subsp.</p>
<p>argentata, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Silver lupine plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities.</p>
