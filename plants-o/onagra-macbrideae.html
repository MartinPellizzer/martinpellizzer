                    <h1>Onagra macbrideae</h1>
<p>Onagra macbrideae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a trailing growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Onagra macbrideae is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
