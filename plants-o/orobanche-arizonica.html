                    <h1>Orobanche arizonica</h1>
<p>Orobanche arizonica, commonly known as Arizona broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found primarily in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, often growing in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize various crops.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
