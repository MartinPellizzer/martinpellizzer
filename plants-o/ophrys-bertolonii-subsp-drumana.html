<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>drumana, commonly known as the Drumana bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like shape, complete with a dark, hairy labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
