                    <h1>Orobanche flava var. doriae</h1>
<p>Orobanche flava var. doriae, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and forming a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
