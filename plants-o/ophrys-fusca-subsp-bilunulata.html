<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>bilunulata, commonly known as the bilunulata bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking combination of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
