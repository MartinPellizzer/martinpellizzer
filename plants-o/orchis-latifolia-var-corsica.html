                    <h1>Orchis latifolia var. corsica</h1>
<p>Orchis latifolia var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of pale pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
<p>The orchid's rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
