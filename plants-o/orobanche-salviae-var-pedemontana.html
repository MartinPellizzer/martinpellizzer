                    <h1>Orobanche salviae var. pedemontana</h1>
<p>Orobanche salviae var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Pedemontan hare's-foot, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the mint family, such as Salvia species, and is found in Mediterranean regions. Its small, fleshy stems and distinctive floral structure make it a unique and specialized member of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a specific role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
