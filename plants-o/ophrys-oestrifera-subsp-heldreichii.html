<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates with sufficient moisture. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
