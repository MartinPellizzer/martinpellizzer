<p>Ophrys cornuta subsp.</p>
<p>balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
