<p>Oenothera lampasana, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that disperses when disturbed.</p>
<p>Oenothera lampasana is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
