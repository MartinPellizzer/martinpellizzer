                    <h1>Orchis natalis</h1>
<p>Orchis natalis, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Portugal. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late autumn and early winter. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis natalis is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
