                    <h1>Ouratea aquatica</h1>
<p>Ouratea aquatica, commonly known as water ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in swampy environments.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
