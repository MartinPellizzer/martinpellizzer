<p>Opuntia penicilligera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and its stems are thick and fleshy, storing water for drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Opuntia penicilligera is also known for its edible fruits, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>
