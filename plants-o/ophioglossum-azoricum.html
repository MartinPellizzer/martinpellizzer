                    <h1>Ophioglossum azoricum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Azores.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
