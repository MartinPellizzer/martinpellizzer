                    <h1>Ophrys × difonzoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × difonzoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Italy and Greece. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent yellow and brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Ophrys × difonzoi lies in its unique morphology and its role as a natural hybrid in orchid taxonomy.</p>
