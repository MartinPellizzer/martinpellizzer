<p>Oxalis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish hue at the base.
