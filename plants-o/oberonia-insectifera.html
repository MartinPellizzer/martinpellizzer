                    <h1>Oberonia insectifera</h1>
<p>Oberonia insectifera, commonly known as the insect-eating orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is named for its unique ability to trap and digest small insects, a trait that sets it apart from most other orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
