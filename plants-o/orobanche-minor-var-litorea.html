                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. litorea</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. litorea, commonly known as the coastal broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a specialized connection called a haustorium. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in sandy or coastal habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant populations.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific coastal regions, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
