<p>Ophrys panormitana, commonly known as the Panormita bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect wings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys panormitana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
