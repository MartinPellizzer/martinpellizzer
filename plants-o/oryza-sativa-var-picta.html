                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. picta</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. picta, commonly known as the variegated rice plant, is a cultivar of rice characterized by its striking variegated leaf patterns.</p>
<p>This variant exhibits a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or red pigmentation on its foliage, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments in varying concentrations. The plant is primarily grown as an ornamental species rather than for grain production, though it retains the basic botanical structure of typical rice plants. Its leaves are usually shorter and more compact compared to standard rice varieties, and it often displays a unique, eye-catching appearance.</p>
<p>Oryza sativa var. picta is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>
