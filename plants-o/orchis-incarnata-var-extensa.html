                    <h1>Orchis incarnata var. extensa</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata var. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved pink orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and woodland edges in North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical *Orchis incarnata*. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in which it grows.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more extensive leaf structure compared to the standard form.</p>
