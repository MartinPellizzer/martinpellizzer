<p>Ophrys gackiae, commonly known as the Gacki's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that closely resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys gackiae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
