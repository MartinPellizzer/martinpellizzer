<p>Oenothera tetraptera var. immutabilis, commonly known as the immutability evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its genetic stability and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
