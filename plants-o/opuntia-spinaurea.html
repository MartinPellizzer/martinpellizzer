<p>Opuntia spinaurea, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are often used in culinary applications. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and a reduced leaf structure to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia spinaurea plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
