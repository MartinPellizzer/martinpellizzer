<p>Oporinia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and lack true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Oporinia hispidula is often found in nutrient-rich waters and is an indicator species for certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
