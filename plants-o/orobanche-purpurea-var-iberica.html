                    <h1>Orobanche purpurea var. iberica</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurea var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in Mediterranean regions, particularly in southern Europe and North Africa. The plant produces showy, often purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically parasitizes various host plants, including legumes and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
