<p>Ophiorrhiza kuroiwae, commonly known as the Kuroiwa's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Dipterocarpaceae family, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized roots. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are usually arranged in pairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
