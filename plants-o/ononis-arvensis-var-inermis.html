<p>Ononis arvensis var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are alternate, oblong, and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
