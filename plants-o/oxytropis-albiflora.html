                    <h1>Oxytropis albiflora</h1>
<p>Oxytropis albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
<p>Oxytropis albiflora is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along riverbanks.</p>
