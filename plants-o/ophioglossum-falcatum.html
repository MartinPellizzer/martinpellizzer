                    <h1>Ophioglossum falcatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum falcatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble a snake's tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a primitive structure, with a single unbranched sporophyll and a short, erect sporangium at the tip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum falcatum is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution.</p>
