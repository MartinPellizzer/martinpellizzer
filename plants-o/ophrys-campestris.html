                    <h1>Ophrys campestris</h1>
<p>Ophrys campestris, commonly known as the field orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble female insects, a feature known as mimicry, which aids in pollination by bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Ophrys campestris is often found in temperate regions across Europe and is considered a valuable indicator of healthy, undisturbed grassland ecosystems.</p>
