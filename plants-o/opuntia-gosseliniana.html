<p>Opuntia gosseliniana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Opuntia gosseliniana is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
