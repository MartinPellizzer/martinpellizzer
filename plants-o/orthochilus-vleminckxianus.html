<p>Orthochilus vleminckxianus, commonly known as the Vleminckx's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and intricately shaped, often displaying a range of colors from greenish-white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
