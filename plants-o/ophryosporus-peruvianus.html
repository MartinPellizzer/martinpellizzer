                    <h1>Ophryosporus peruvianus</h1>
<p>Ophryosporus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, often arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophryosporus peruvianus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
