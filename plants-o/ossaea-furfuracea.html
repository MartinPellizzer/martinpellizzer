<p>Ossaea furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves with a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ossaea furfuracea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
