                    <h1>Opuntia delicata</h1>
<p>Opuntia delicata, commonly known as the delicate prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, white glochids, which are fine, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia delicata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
