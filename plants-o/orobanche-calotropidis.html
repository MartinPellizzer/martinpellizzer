                    <h1>Orobanche calotropidis</h1>
<p>Orobanche calotropidis, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India and Nepal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It parasitizes plants from the milkweed family, such as Asclepias, by attaching to their roots.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
