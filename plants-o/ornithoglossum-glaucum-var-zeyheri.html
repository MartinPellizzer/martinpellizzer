                    <h1>Ornithoglossum glaucum var. zeyheri</h1>
<p>Ornithoglossum glaucum var. zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's bluebell, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
