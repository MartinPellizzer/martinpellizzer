<p>Osmunda regalis subsp.</p>
<p>spectabilis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, thriving in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive dimorphic life cycle, with a sporophyte phase and a gametophyte phase that differs in morphology. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural habitats.</p>
