<p>Ophrys × boscoquartensis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>difesae, commonly known as the Boscoquartensis bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, a feature typical of many Ophrys species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
