<p>Oplismenus limosus, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oplismenus limosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in its native habitat.</p>
