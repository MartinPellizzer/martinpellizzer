<p>Ononis tridentata var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Ononis genus, which are typically characterized by their small, clustered flowers and drought-tolerant growth habits.</p>
