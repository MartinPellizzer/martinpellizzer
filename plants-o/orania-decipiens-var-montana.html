                    <h1>Orania decipiens var. montana</h1>
<p>Orania decipiens var. montana, commonly known as the mountain false heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
