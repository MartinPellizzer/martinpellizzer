                    <h1>Orobanche krausei</h1>
<p>Orobanche krausei, commonly known as the Krause's broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Medicago*. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil until a suitable host is present.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range.</p>
