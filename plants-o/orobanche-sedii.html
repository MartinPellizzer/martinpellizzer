                    <h1>Orobanche sedii</h1>
<p>Orobanche sedii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of a host plant and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Orobanche sedii is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
