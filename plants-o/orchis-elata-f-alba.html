                    <h1>Orchis elata f. alba</h1>
<p>Orchis elata f. alba, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green foliage and a single white or pale pink flower. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
