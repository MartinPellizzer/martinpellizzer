                    <h1>Orothamnus</h1>
<p>Orothamnus, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically perennial and are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Orothamnus species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in restoration projects due to their hardy nature.</p>
