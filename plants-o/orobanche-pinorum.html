                    <h1>Orobanche pinorum</h1>
<p>Orobanche pinorum, commonly known as the pine barren broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its dependence on host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in association with pine trees. It is found in sandy soils and is typically associated with pine forests in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
