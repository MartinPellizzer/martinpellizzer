                <h1>Orchis nana</h1>
<p>Orchis nana, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, loamy soil. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet or purple flowers in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Orchis nana is a relatively rare species in many regions, making it a valuable component of diverse plant communities.</p>
