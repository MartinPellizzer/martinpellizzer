<p>Oberonia benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet Oberonia, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Philippines.</p>

The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in primary lowland dipterocarp forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia benguetensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
