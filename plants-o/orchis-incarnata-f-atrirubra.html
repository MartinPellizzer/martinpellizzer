                    <h1>Orchis incarnata f. atrirubra</h1>
<p>Orchis incarnata f. atrirubra, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a striking variant of the showy lady's tresses orchid.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist woodlands and wet meadows in eastern North America. The plant features a tall, erect stem with dense, spirally arranged leaves and a long, branched inflorescence of violet-blue flowers. Its flowers are characterized by deep red veins, which distinguish it from the typical form.</p>
<p>This orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is an indicator species for rich, undisturbed habitats.</p>
