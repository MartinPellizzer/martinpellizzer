                    <h1>Osmunda herbacea</h1>
<p>Osmunda herbacea, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda herbacea plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
