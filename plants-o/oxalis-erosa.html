<p>Oxalis erosa, commonly known as the pale wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped lobes and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, dark seeds. Oxalis erosa thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to spread through runners, forming dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
