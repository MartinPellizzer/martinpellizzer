                    <h1>Ophrys × pulsanoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pulsanoi, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and have a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>Ophrys × pulsanoi is often found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in regions with well-drained soils and moderate climates.</p>
