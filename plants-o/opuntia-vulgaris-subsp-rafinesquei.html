<p>Opuntia vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, a feature typical of cacti in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
