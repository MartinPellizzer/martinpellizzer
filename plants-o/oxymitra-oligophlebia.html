                    <h1>Oxymitra oligophlebia</h1>
<p>Oxymitra oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oxymitra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxymitra oligophlebia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
