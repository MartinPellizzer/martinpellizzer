                    <h1>Orthophytum burle-marxii var. seabrae</h1>
<p>Orthophytum burle-marxii var. seabrae, commonly known as the Burle Marx Cactus, is a unique succulent native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its foliage is covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
