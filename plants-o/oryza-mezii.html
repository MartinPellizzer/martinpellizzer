                    <h1>Oryza mezii</h1>
<p>Oryza mezii, commonly known as the Bornean ricegrass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, adapting to high humidity and waterlogged soils. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a wild relative of cultivated rice, offering insights into genetic diversity and evolution within the Oryza genus.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oryza mezii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems.</p>
