                    <h1>Ophrys bifolia</h1>
<p>Ophrys bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream sides. Its leaves are usually two in number, hence the species name "bifolia," and are often narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, producing a striking pink or purple coloration that attracts male bees for pollination.</p>
