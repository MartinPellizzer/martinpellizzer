                    <h1>Oreopanax sandianus</h1>
<p>Oreopanax sandianus, commonly known as the Sandia mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
