                    <h1>Oxygonum pachybasis</h1>
<p>Oxygonum pachybasis, commonly known as the broad-leafed spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, thickened stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves and stems contain latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Oxygonum pachybasis is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its water-storing tissues and deep root system.</p>
