<p>Opuntia seguina, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia seguina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
