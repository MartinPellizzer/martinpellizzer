<p>It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns and a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
