                <h1>Oreogrammitis ceratocarpa</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis ceratocarpa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant's spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its epiphytic lifestyle, with specialized roots for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
