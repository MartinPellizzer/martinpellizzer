<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>lacaena, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent lip resembling a bee's face.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's mimicry, a form of sexual deception.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
