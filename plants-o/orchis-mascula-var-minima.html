                    <h1>Orchis mascula var. minima</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula var. minima, commonly known as the small male orchid, is a rare and diminutive orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and distinctive, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
