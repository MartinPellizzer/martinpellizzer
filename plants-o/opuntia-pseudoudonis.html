                    <h1>Opuntia pseudoudonis</h1>
<p>Opuntia pseudoudonis, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a perennial cactus characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems, which are often covered in small, white glochids that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by small, red fruits that contain edible seeds.</p>
<p>Opuntia pseudoudonis is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and minimizing water loss through reduced leaf surface area.</p>
