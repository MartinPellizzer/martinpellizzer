<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>picta, commonly known as the painted bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are adorned with distinctive markings that enhance its mimicry, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-pollinator interactions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
