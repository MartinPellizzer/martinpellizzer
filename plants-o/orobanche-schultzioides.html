                    <h1>Orobanche schultzioides</h1>
<p>Orobanche schultzioides, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology with no true leaves. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Crotalaria.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
