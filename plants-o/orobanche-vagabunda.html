                    <h1>Orobanche vagabunda</h1>
<p>Orobanche vagabunda, commonly known as the wandering broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, and it can remain dormant in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
