                    <h1>Orobanche hyalina</h1>
<p>Orobanche hyalina, commonly known as the glassy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize slightly but primarily depends on its host for sustenance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops and native plant communities.</p>
