                    <h1>Onychacanthus</h1>
<p>Onychacanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. These bracts are modified leaves and serve as a protective mechanism for the central flower cluster. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to saline and well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Onychacanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
