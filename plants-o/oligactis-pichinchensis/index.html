                            <h1>Oligactis Pichinchensis</h1>
<p>Pichincha cucumber, scientifically known as Oligactis pichinchensis, is a unique and lesser-known species native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. This rare plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Despite its limited distribution, it has gained attention for its distinct appearance and potential medicinal properties. The cucumber's name reflects its connection to the Pichincha region, where it has been historically used by local communities. Its cultivation remains challenging, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
