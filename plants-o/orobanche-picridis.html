                    <h1>Orobanche picridis</h1>
<p>Orobanche picridis, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, often causing significant stress to the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
