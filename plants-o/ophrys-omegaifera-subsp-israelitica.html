<p>Ophrys omegaifera subsp.</p>
<p>israelitica, commonly known as the Israeli bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Israel. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has slender, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive bee-like shape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
