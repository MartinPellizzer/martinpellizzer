<p>Ophrys × minuticauda nothosubsp.</p>
<p>donorensis, commonly known as the miniature bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, hairy stem and a single, narrow leaf.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature used to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, typically found in woodland or heathland environments.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
