<p>Oxalis corniculata var. repens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated settings.</p>
