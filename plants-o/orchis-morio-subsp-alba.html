<p>Orchis morio subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
