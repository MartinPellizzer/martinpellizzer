<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>passionis, commonly known as the Passion Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, striking flower with a dark, wasp-like labellum and a distinctive, reddish-brown coloration. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
