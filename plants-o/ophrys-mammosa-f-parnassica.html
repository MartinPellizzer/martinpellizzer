                    <h1>Ophrys mammosa f. parnassica</h1>
<p>Ophrys mammosa f. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent, bulbous lip resembling a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
