<p>Oxalis missionum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Oxalis missionum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to enrich soil with nitrogen through its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
