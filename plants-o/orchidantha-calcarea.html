<p>Orchidantha calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and prefers well-drained, moist environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Orchidantha calcarea is often found in rocky or limestone-rich areas, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
