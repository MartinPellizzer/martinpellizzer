<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>sphegodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers.</p>
<p>The orchid is a hemiparasitic plant, relying on a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
