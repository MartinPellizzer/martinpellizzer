                    <h1>Ophrys naxensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys naxensis, commonly known as the Naxos orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a single, brightly colored flower. Its habitat is limited to specific calcareous soils in open, sunny areas, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, Ophrys naxensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
