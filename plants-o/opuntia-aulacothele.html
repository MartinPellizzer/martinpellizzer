<p>Opuntia aulacothele, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia aulacothele is adapted to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
