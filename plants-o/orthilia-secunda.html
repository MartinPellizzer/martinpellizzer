<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Orthilia secunda plays an important role in water ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
