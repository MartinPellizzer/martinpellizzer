                    <h1>Oryzidium</h1>
<p>Oryzidium, commonly known as the rice fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori on the underside of its leaves. Oryzidium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and rapid growth make it a common species in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
