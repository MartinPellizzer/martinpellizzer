<p>Ophrys omegaifera subsp.</p>
<p>basilissa, commonly known as the Basilissa bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it thrives in calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short lifespan, typically flowering once before dying.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
