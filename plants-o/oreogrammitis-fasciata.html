<p>Oreogrammitis fasciata, commonly known as the stripe-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on rocky surfaces, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are linear and often have distinct midribs, with a pale green to yellowish coloration. This moss is typically found in temperate regions, growing on limestone or slate substrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores into the air.</p>
