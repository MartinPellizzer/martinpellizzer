<p>Odontosoria scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with rhizomes that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Odontosoria scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and moist woodlands.</p>
