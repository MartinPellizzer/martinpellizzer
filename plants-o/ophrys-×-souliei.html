                    <h1>Ophrys × souliei</h1>
<p>Ophrys × souliei, commonly known as the Souchet's orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its intricate floral morphology.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique mimicry of female wasps, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks, where it can thrive in the presence of its specific pollinators. Its flowers are adorned with specialized structures, including a labellum that resembles a wasp's body, and a column that facilitates pollen transfer.</p>
<p>This hybrid species showcases the remarkable adaptability and evolutionary strategies of orchids in their ecological niches.</p>
