                    <h1>Oncostemum elephantipes</h1>
<p>Oncostemum elephantipes, commonly known as the giant elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, swollen base that resembles an elephant's foot, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and typically green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncostemum elephantipes is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
