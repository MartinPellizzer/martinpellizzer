                    <h1>Oligandra chrysocoma</h1>
<p>Oligandra chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and is notable for its inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its berries, contributing to its distribution across different host species.</p>
<p>Oligandra chrysocoma plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both host tree health and avian populations.</p>
