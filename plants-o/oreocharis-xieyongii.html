<p>Oreocharis xieyongii, commonly known as the Xieyongii stonecrop, is a rare and striking member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
