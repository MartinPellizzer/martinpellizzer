                    <h1>Ouret triangularifolia</h1>
<p>Ouret triangularifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ouret triangularifolia is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
