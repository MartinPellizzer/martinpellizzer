<p>Orobanche wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to its hosts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it parasitizes various species of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
