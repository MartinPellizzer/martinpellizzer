                    <h1>Orogenia</h1>
<p>Orogenia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, orogenia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
