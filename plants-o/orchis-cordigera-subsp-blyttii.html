<p>Orchis cordigera subsp.</p>
<p>blyttii, commonly known as the Blytt's early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, reflecting its ecological niche.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its early flowering period, often blooming in late spring.</p>
