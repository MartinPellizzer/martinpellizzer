                    <h1>Ophioglossum nudicaule</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum nudicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is located at the base of the leaf. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with spores produced in clusters rather than individual sporangia.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum nudicaule is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for several decades.</p>
