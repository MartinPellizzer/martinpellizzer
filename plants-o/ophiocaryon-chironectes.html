                    <h1>Ophiocaryon chironectes</h1>
<p>Ophiocaryon chironectes, commonly known as the chironectes mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the canopy of tropical and subtropical forests, where it attaches to the branches of host trees such as those in the genus *Cecropia*. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis to supplement its energy needs. Its small, leathery leaves are typically clustered in dense, spherical formations.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species.</p>
