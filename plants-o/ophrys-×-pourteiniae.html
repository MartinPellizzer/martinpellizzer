                    <h1>Ophrys × pourteiniae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pourteiniae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
