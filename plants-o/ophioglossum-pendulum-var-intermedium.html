                    <h1>Ophioglossum pendulum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum pendulum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned between the two fertile leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is native to regions of eastern North America. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a central vein.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
