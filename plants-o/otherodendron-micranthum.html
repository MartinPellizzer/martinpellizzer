<p>Otherodendron micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
