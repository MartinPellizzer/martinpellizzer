<p>Opuntia weberi var. dispar, commonly known as the Weber's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
