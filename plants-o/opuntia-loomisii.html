<p>Opuntia loomisii, commonly known as the Loomis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruit that is typically red or orange in color. Opuntia loomisii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species within the Opuntia genus.</p>
