                    <h1>Ophrys smallii</h1>
<p>Ophrys smallii, commonly known as the small orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, leafless stem that bears a single flower. The flower has a distinctive pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is often mimicking the appearance of an insect to aid in pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries.</p>
