                    <h1>Orthochilus platypetalus</h1>
<p>Orthochilus platypetalus, commonly known as the flat-petaled orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, flat petals that distinguish it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orthochilus platypetalus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
