<p>Ononis columnae var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sand-hopper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments.</p>
