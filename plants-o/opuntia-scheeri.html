                    <h1>Opuntia scheeri</h1>
<p>Opuntia scheeri, commonly known as the Scheeri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Opuntia genus. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia scheeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine.</p>
