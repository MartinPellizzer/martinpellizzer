<p>Ornithopus varius, commonly known as the variable ornithopus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
