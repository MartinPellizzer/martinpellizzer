                    <h1>Ophrys creticola</h1>
<p>Ophrys creticola, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys creticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
