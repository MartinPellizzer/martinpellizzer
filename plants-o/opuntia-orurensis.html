                    <h1>Opuntia orurensis</h1>
<p>Opuntia orurensis, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it both visually distinctive and somewhat defensive. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia orurensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and performing photosynthesis through its stems rather than leaves.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
