<p>Oncidium andreanum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flowers that resemble butterflies, typically in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it suitable for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>Oncidium andreanum is popular in horticulture due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
