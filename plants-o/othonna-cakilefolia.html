                    <h1>Othonna cakilefolia</h1>
<p>Othonna cakilefolia, commonly known as the coastal othonna, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adapted to store water and withstand salty air. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Othonna cakilefolia is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and poor soil conditions.</p>
