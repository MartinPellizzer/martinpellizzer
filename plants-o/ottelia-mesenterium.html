<p>Ottelia mesenterium, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, while its stems and leaves remain above the water surface.</p>
<p>Ottelia mesenterium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
