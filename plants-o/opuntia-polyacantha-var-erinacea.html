                    <h1>Opuntia polyacantha var. erinacea</h1>
<p>Opuntia polyacantha var. erinacea, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
