                    <h1>Orobanche nuda</h1>
<p>Orobanche nuda, commonly known as the naked broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the family Fabaceae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
