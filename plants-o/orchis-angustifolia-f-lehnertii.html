<p>Orchis angustifolia f. lehnertii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
