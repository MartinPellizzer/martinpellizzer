                    <h1>Ormocarpum glabrum</h1>
<p>Ormocarpum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth orchid or smooth orchid vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes a wide variety of orchids, though it is not a true orchid in the traditional sense. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its smooth, hairless leaves and distinctive floral structure make it a unique subject for botanical study.</p>
