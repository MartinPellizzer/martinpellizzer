                    <h1>Orobanche klugei</h1>
<p>Orobanche klugei, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as various species of Crotalaria and Astragalus.</p>
<p>Orobanche klugei plays a unique role in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat through its specialized parasitic relationship.</p>
