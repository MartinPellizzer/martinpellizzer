                    <h1>Opuntia leucotricha var. fulvispina</h1>
<p>Opuntia leucotricha var. fulvispina, commonly known as the golden spine prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and contains seeds.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
