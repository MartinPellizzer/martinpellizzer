                    <h1>Orchis × salteri</h1>
<p>Orchis × salteri, commonly known as the Salter's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous root system, typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing spike-like inflorescences with showy, violet to purple flowers that have a distinctive, spurred lip. Its botanical features reflect a blend of its parent species, showcasing morphological variability.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a relict population with limited distribution in specific regions of Europe.</p>
