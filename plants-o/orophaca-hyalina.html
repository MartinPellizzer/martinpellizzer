<p>Orophaca hyalina, commonly known as the glassy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Orophaca hyalina is considered endangered and requires protected environments to survive.</p>
