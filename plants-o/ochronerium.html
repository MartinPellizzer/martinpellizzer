                    <h1>Ochronerium</h1>
<p>Ochronerium, commonly known as the glassy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ochronerium is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is used by some insects as a food source.</p>
