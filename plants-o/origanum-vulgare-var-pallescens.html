                    <h1>Origanum vulgare var. pallescens</h1>
<p>Origanum vulgare var. pallescens, commonly known as pale oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its aromatic leaves are used in cooking and traditional medicine, similar to other members of the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard oregano but is valued for its unique appearance and mild flavor.</p>
