                    <h1>Orchis aphylla</h1>
<p>Orchis aphylla, commonly known as the barren orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, instead producing small, greenish-brown blooms that are often hidden among its foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it has a short, erect stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis aphylla is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
