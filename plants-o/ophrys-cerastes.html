<p>Ophrys cerastes, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like appearance, with a lip that mimics the face of a bee to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive horn-shaped spur.</p>
<p>Ophrys cerastes relies on specialized pollination by bees, which are deceived into visiting the flower as if it were a potential mate.</p>
