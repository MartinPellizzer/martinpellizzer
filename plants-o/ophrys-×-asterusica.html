                    <h1>Ophrys × asterusica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × asterusica, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral morphology that mimics the appearance of female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are typically yellow or brown with dark markings, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination mechanism, it plays an important role in the ecological interactions of its habitat.</p>
