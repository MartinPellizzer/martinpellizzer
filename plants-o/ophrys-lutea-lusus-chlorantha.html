                    <h1>Ophrys lutea lusus chlorantha</h1>
<p>Ophrys lutea lusus chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
