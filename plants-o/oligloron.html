                    <h1>Oligloron</h1>
<p>Oligloron, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Oligloron is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
