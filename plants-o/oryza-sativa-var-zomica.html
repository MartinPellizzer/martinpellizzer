                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. zomica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. zomica, commonly known as a wild rice species, is a grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and flooded fields, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces flowers that are usually green or pale yellow.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
