                    <h1>Orobanche medicaginis</h1>
<p>Orobanche medicaginis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species such as clover and vetch. The plant produces small, often pale or yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It is found in various parts of Europe and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
