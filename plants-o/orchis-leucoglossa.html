                    <h1>Orchis leucoglossa</h1>
<p>Orchis leucoglossa, commonly known as the white-lipped twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced foliage, with most of its photosynthesis occurring through its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
