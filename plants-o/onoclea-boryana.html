<p>Onoclea boryana, commonly known as the Bory's water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize shallow water environments effectively.</p>
<p>Onoclea boryana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
