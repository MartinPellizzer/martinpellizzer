                    <h1>Orbea sacculata</h1>
<p>Orbea sacculata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rain.</p>
<p>Orbea sacculata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
