<p>Ottelia brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, broad leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Ottelia brachyphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
