<p>Ophrys passionis subsp.</p>
<p>garganica, commonly known as the Garganica orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like floral structure that mimics the appearance of female insects, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodlands and mountainous regions, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with complex patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
