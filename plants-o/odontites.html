<p>Odontites, commonly known as toothworts, are small, herbaceous plants belonging to the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their rosette-like growth habit and often have hairy, fleshy leaves. Odontites species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>These plants are notable for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and their unique, sometimes subterranean, growth patterns.</p>
