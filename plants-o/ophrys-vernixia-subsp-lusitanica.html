<p>Ophrys vernixia subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southwestern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
