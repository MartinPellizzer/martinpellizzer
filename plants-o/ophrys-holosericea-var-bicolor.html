                    <h1>Ophrys holosericea var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Ophrys holosericea var. bicolor, commonly known as the Two-Colored Bee Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers feature a distinctive bicolor pattern, with a pale yellow base and a darker, almost black, upper lip.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as endangered in several regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
