<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>myodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in dry, calcareous grasslands and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
