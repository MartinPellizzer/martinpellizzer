                    <h1>Oreogenia filiformis</h1>
<p>Oreogenia filiformis, commonly known as the slender mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, filament-like stems and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on exposed slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Oreogenia filiformis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
