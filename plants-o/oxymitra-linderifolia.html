                    <h1>Oxymitra linderifolia</h1>
<p>Oxymitra linderifolia, commonly known as the lace-leaf oxymitra, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined leaves that give it its common name. Native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, this plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers, which are typically violet or purple, are small and clustered, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oxymitra linderifolia is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
