<p>Onohualcoa helicocalyx, commonly known as the spiral-leaved tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along its stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its woody structure makes it a hardy shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and leathery, providing a distinct texture and aiding in water retention.</p>
