<p>Otiophora lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is usually greenish to yellowish in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on rocky surfaces in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Otiophora lanceolata is relatively rare and is considered a indicator species for specific ecological conditions.</p>
