<p>Ophrys × garnierae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. This plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The flowers exhibit a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × garnierae is typically found in Mediterranean regions, growing in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils.</p>
