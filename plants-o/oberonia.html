                    <h1>Oberonia</h1>
<p>Oberonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Oberonia species typically have dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produce flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Oberonia species are considered endangered or threatened.</p>
