                    <h1>Ornithoxanthum pusillum</h1>
<p>Ornithoxanthum pusillum, commonly known as the small-bird yellow grass, is a low-growing annual grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 10â€“20 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological role in supporting insect populations.</p>
