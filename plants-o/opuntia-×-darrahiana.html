<p>Opuntia × darrahiana, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Opuntia × darrahiana is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
