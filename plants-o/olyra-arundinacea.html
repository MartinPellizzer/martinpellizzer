                    <h1>Olyra arundinacea</h1>
<p>Olyra arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species.</p>
