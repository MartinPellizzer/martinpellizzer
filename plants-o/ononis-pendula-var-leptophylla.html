                    <h1>Ononis pendula var. leptophylla</h1>
<p>Ononis pendula var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved weeping crowfoot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that often hang over rocky or gravelly substrates. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
