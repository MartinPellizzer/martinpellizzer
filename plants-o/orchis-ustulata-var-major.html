                    <h1>Orchis ustulata var. major</h1>
<p>Orchis ustulata var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>The greater marsh orchid is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
