                    <h1>Ostryoderris</h1>
<p>Ostryoderris, commonly known as the black rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects members of the genus *Ostrya*, which includes species like the American hornbeam.</p>
<p>It causes a distinctive rust disease characterized by the formation of orange spore pustules on the leaves. The fungus has a complex life cycle involving two host plants, one of which is typically a *Ostrya* species. It thrives in moist, humid conditions and can lead to defoliation and reduced growth in infected trees.</p>
<p>Management often involves removing infected plant material and improving air circulation around the host plants.</p>
