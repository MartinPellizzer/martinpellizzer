                    <h1>Ophrys vespifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys vespifera, commonly known as the wasp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, wasp-like appearance, with a yellow face and brown markings that mimic the appearance of a wasp. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 cm and produces a single, erect flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by wasps, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower, a strategy that ensures effective pollination.</p>
