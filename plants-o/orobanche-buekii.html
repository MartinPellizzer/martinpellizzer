                    <h1>Orobanche buekii</h1>
<p>Orobanche buekii, commonly known as the Buek's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, swollen stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield.</p>
