                    <h1>Onychacanthus arboreus</h1>
<p>Onychacanthus arboreus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining natural environment, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
