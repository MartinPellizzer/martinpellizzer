<p>Oenothera tubicula var. filifolia, commonly known as the filifoliated evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its specific epithet "filifolia," meaning "thread-leaved.". The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This variant is part of the broader Oenothera genus, which includes many species known for their medicinal and ornamental value.</p>
