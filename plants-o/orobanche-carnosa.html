                    <h1>Orobanche carnosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche carnosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in biological control.</p>
