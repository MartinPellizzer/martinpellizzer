                    <h1>Ophrys subfusca f. leucadica</h1>
<p>Ophrys subfusca f. leucadica, commonly known as the white-veined bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive coloration that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
