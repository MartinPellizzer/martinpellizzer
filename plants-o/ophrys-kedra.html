                    <h1>Ophrys kedra</h1>
<p>Ophrys kedra, commonly known as the Kedros fly orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys kedra is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
