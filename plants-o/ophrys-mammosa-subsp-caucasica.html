<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and dark green, while its flowers are pendulous and feature a prominent lip that resembles a bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
