                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the little whisk fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, upright frond that is typically divided into two lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its frond, which are clustered in small, stalked clusters called sporangium clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
