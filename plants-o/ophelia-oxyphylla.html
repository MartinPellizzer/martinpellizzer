<p>Ophelia oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible rhizomes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and arrow-shaped, typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Ophelia oxyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
