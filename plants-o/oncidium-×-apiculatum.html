<p>Oncidium × apiculatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear numerous fragrant, yellowish-orange blooms resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncidium × apiculatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
