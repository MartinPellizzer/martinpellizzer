<p>Olbia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a rough, granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Olbia hispida is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
