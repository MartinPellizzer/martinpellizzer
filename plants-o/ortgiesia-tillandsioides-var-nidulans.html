                    <h1>Ortgiesia tillandsioides var. nidulans</h1>
<p>Ortgiesia tillandsioides var. nidulans, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
