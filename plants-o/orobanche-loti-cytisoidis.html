                    <h1>Orobanche loti-cytisoidis</h1>
<p>Orobanche loti-cytisoidis, commonly known as the common broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often purple or yellow flowers. This species typically parasitizes leguminous plants, such as those in the genera *Lotus* and *Cytisus*, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle involves germination in the presence of host root exudates, followed by the establishment of a parasitic relationship.</p>
<p>The plant is found in various regions across Europe and is considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
