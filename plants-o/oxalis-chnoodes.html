                    <h1>Oxalis chnoodes</h1>
<p>Oxalis chnoodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf structure and its role as a food source for certain insect species.</p>
