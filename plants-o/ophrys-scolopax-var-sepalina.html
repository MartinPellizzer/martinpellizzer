                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. sepalina</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. sepalina, commonly known as the Sepaline Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles the body of a bee, complete with fine hairs and a dark marking. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragmentation, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
