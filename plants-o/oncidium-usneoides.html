                    <h1>Oncidium usneoides</h1>
<p>Oncidium usneoides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives on trees in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging strands of green to brown filaments. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree.</p>
