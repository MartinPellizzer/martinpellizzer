<p>Orchis purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>lokiana, commonly known as the Lokian purple orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem bearing a single spike of violet to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
