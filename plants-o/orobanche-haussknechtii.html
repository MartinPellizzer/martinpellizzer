                    <h1>Orobanche haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Orobanche haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknecht's broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is considered a rare and elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialist plant.</p>
