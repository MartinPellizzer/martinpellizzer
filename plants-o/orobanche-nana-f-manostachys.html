                    <h1>Orobanche nana f. manostachys</h1>
<p>Orobanche nana f. manostachys, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is often found parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
