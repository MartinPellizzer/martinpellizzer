<p>Opuntia undosa, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia undosa is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
