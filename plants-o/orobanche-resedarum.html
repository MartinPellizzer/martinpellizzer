                    <h1>Orobanche resedarum</h1>
<p>Orobanche resedarum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and it typically infests crops such as wheat and barley. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields if left unchecked.</p>
