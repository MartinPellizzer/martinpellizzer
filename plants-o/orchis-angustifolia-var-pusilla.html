                    <h1>Orchis angustifolia var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Orchis angustifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
