                    <h1>Opuntia ledienii</h1>
<p>Opuntia ledienii, commonly known as the Ledien's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ledienii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use.</p>
