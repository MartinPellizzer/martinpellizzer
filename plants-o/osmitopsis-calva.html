<p>Osmitopsis calva, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caliciaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, crust-like thallus that often appears on bark and stone surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its structure is typically foliose or crustose, with a thin, leathery texture.</p>
<p>Osmitopsis calva is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
