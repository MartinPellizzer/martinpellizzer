                    <h1>Ornithopodium</h1>
<p>Ornithopodium, commonly known as the "bird's-foot" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a bird's foot, with several lobes radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Ornithopodium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
