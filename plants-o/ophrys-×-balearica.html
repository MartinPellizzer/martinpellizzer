                    <h1>Ophrys × balearica</h1>
<p>Ophrys × balearica, commonly known as the Balearic bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, fuzzy labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
