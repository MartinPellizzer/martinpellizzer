<p>Oncocarpus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leafed mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Its roots often form a dense network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Oncocarpus trachyphyllus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
