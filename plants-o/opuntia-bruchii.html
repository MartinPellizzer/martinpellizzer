<p>Opuntia bruchii, commonly known as the Burckhardt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia bruchii is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region.</p>
