                    <h1>Orobanche multicaulis var. genuina</h1>
<p>Orobanche multicaulis var. genuina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically infests members of the legume family, such as vetch and alfalfa, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often in disturbed or agricultural soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.</p>
