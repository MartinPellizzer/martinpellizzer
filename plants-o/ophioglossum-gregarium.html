                    <h1>Ophioglossum gregarium</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum gregarium, commonly known as the common adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, erect, leaf-like structure that bears the sporangia. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with the sporophylls arranged in a unique, spiral pattern that aids in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum gregarium is considered a primitive fern due to its ancient lineage and simplified morphology.</p>
