                    <h1>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. leiantehra</h1>
<p>Orobanche aegyptiaca var. leiantehra, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This species is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. Its life cycle is highly dependent on the presence of suitable host plants, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests cultivated fields.</p>
