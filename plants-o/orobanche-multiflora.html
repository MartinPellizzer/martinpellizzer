<p>Orobanche multiflora, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a branched stem with numerous small, scale-like leaves. It typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
