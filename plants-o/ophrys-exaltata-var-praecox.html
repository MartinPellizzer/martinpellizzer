                    <h1>Ophrys exaltata var. praecox</h1>
<p>Ophrys exaltata var. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are pale yellow with a dark brown or black lip. The flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, with a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It blooms in early spring, often before the main flowering season of other orchids.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
