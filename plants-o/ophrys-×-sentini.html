                    <h1>Ophrys × sentini</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sentini, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is notable for its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. Its flowers typically feature a dark brown or black lip that resembles an insect's body, along with a showy, often yellow or greenish dorsal sepal.</p>
<p>Ophrys × sentini is usually found in calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
