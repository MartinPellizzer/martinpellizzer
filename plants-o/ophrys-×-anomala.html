                    <h1>Ophrys × anomala</h1>
<p>Ophrys × anomala, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which closely resembles the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black hues, with a distinctive "face" that mimics insect features.</p>
<p>This mimicry attracts male wasps, which attempt to mate with the flower, thereby facilitating pollination.</p>
