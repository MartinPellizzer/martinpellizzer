<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>taurica, commonly known as the Tauric bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure known as a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
