<p>Oxytropis viscida subsp.</p>
<p>hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's sticky locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, glandular hair covering its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its sticky secretions, which can deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal.</p>
