<p>Oxydectes saltensis, commonly known as the salt marsh dandelion, is a flowering plant native to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are adapted to attract pollinators in its specialized habitat. Oxydectes saltensis is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes where it tolerates high salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
