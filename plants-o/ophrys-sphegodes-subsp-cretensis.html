<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species endemic to Crete. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in limestone-rich environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
