                    <h1>Omania</h1>
<p>Omania, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark, a trait unique to this species. The plant's leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold climates of its habitat. Omania flowers only once in its lifetime, typically during the summer months, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in its native region.</p>
