                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. corbariensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbarien bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, yellowish-brown flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
