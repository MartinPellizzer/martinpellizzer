<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>sipontensis, commonly known as the Sipontine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees through a process called sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
