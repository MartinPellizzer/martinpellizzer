                    <h1>Origanum hirtum var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Origanum hirtum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
