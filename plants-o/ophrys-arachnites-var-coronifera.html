                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. coronifera</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. coronifera, commonly known as the Crowned Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, bee-like labellum that attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters, and it thrives in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
