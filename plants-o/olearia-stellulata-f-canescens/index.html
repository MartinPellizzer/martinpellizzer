                            <h1>Olearia Stellulata F. Canescens</h1>
<p>Olearia stellulata f. canescens is a rare and striking variant of the native New Zealand plant Olearia stellulata. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and fluffy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. This form is known for its unique hirsute appearance, which sets it apart from the typical green-leaved version. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas with mild climates. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and conservationists alike.</p>
