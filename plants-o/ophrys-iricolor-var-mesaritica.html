<p>Ophrys iricolor var. mesaritica, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces striking violet-colored flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
