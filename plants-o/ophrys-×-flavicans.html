                    <h1>Ophrys × flavicans</h1>
<p>Ophrys × flavicans, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a yellow labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Ophrys × flavicans is a short-lived perennial, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to persist in its environment.</p>
