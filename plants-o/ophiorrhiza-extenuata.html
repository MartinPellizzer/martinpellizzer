                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza extenuata</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza extenuata, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of tropical trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a short, creeping stem and produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is found in Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
