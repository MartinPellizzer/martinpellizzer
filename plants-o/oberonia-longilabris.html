<p>Oberonia longilabris, commonly known as the long-labied orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display a range of colors from white to pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
