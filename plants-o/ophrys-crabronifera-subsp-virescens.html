<p>Ophrys crabronifera subsp.</p>
<p>virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a wasp, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor soils, often in open woodland or heathland habitats. It produces a single erect flowering stem with several showy, lip-like petals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
