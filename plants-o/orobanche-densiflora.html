                    <h1>Orobanche densiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It commonly parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume and aster families.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and dependence on hosts, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialist parasite.</p>
