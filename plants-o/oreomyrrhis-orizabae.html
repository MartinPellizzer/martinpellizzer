<p>Oreomyrrhis orizabae, commonly known as the Oaxaca lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble lilies. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreomyrrhis orizabae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
