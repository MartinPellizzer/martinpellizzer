<p>Oryzopsis turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered at the nodes of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis turcomanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
