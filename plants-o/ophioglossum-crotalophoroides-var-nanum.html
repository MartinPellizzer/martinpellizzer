                    <h1>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. nanum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum crotalophoroides var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf adder's mouth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology and primitive features.</p>
<p>It possesses a short, creeping rhizome with a single, fleshy, tongue-shaped sporophyll that bears two rows of sporangia. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are small and lanceolate, with a distinct, wavy margin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
