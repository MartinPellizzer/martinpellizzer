                    <h1>Ourisia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Ourisia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic ourisia, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in volcanic landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of volcanic soil conditions.</p>
