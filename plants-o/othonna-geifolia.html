<p>Othonna geifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Othonna geifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
