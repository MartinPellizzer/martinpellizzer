                    <h1>Opophytum hypertrophicum</h1>
<p>Opophytum hypertrophicum, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heavy, spiral-shaped shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the family Achatinidae, although it is not a true plant. Its shell is composed primarily of calcium carbonate and organic compounds, providing structural support and protection.</p>
<p>This species is often mistaken for a plant due to its slow movement and shell structure, but it is a mollusk with complex biological features.</p>
