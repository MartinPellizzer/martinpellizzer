                    <h1>Opuntia ovallei</h1>
<p>Opuntia ovallei, commonly known as the Ovalle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ovallei is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
