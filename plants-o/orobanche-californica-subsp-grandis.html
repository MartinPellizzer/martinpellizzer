<p>Orobanche californica subsp.</p>
<p>grandis, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. It typically parasitizes a variety of flowering plants, particularly those in the families Fabaceae and Asteraceae.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific host requirements, it is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
