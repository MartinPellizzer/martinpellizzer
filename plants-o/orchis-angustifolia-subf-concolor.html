<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and lack a distinct香味, which is typical for many orchids in the subgenus Orchis.</p>
<p>The plant is pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
