<p>Oncidium sasseri, commonly known as the Sasser's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium sasseri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal health.</p>
