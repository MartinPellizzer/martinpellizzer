<p>Oxalis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Oxalis tenuissima is also noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds.</p>
