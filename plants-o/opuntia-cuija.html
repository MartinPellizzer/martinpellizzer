                    <h1>Opuntia cuija</h1>
<p>Opuntia cuija, commonly known as the "Mexican prickly pear," is a species of cactus native to Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Opuntia cuija thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to survive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
