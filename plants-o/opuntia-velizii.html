<p>Opuntia velizii, commonly known as the Velizii prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia velizii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
