                    <h1>Orostachys malacophylla var. aggregata</h1>
<p>Orostachys malacophylla var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in summer. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The varietal name "aggregata" refers to the clustered arrangement of its leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Orostachys malacophylla.</p>
