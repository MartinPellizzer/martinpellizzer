                    <h1>Ophrys apiformis</h1>
<p>Ophrys apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown or black lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's face. It thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and heaths.</p>
<p>Ophrys apiformis is primarily pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower, mistaking it for a female bee.</p>
