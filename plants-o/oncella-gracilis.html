                    <h1>Oncella gracilis</h1>
<p>Oncella gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent bladders that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic and predatory organs.</p>
<p>Oncella gracilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
