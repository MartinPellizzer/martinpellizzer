                    <h1>Orobanche ballotae</h1>
<p>Orobanche ballotae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, usually white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
