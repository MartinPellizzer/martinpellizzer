<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>oblita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its floral structure includes a single, erect flower with a pouch-like labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
