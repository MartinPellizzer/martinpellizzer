                    <h1>Ophrys heldreichii var. pseudoapulica</h1>
<p>Ophrys heldreichii var. pseudoapulica, commonly known as the Heldreich's Ophrys, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
