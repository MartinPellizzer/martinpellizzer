                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera var. cornuta</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, hairy labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The variety cornuta is distinguished by its elongated, horn-shaped spur, which is a key feature in its taxonomic classification.</p>
