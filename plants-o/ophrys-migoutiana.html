                    <h1>Ophrys migoutiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys migoutiana, commonly known as the Migout's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in France and Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys migoutiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
