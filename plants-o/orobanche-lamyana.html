                    <h1>Orobanche lamyana</h1>
<p>Orobanche lamyana, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a connection for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
