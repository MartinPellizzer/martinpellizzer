                    <h1>Orobanche sordida</h1>
<p>Orobanche sordida, commonly known as the pale broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, yellowish or reddish flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Orobanche sordida is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
