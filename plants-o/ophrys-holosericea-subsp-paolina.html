<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>paolina, commonly known as the Paolina Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Italian Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking pouch that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
