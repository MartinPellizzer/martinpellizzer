<p>Ornithidium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant bird's nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design.</p>
