                    <h1>Oreophilus destitutus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus destitutus, commonly known as the barren hill orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas where temperatures remain consistently low. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreophilus destitutus is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
