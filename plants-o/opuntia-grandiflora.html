<p>Opuntia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for housing the plant's defensive spines. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia grandiflora is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, or "pups," which break off and grow into new plants.</p>
