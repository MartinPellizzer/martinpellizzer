<p>Olearia capillaris, commonly known as the slender tree-fern, is a distinctive evergreen shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender trunk with a dense crown of feathery, silvery-green leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its soft, tactile texture.</p>
<p>Olearia capillaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and humid environments.</p>
