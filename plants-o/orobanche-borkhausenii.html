                    <h1>Orobanche borkhausenii</h1>
<p>Orobanche borkhausenii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops.</p>
