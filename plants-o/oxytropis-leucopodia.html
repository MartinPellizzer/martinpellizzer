                    <h1>Oxytropis leucopodia</h1>
<p>Oxytropis leucopodia, commonly known as whiteleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a silvery-white underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Oxytropis leucopodia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in high quantities.</p>
