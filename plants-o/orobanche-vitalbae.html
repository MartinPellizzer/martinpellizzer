                    <h1>Orobanche vitalbae</h1>
<p>Orobanche vitalbae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests cultivated plants.</p>
