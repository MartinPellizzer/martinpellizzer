<p>Otoglossum scansor, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
