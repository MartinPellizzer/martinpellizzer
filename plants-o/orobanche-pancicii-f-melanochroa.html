                    <h1>Orobanche pancicii f. melanochroa</h1>
<p>Orobanche pancicii f. melanochroa, commonly known as the dark-chromed broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to brownish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
