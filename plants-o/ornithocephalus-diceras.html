The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
