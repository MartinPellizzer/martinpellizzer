                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. cyclodes</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. cyclodes, commonly known as the Engelmann's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
