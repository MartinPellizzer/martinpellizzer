<p>Opuntia × alta, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia × alta is also notable for its role in traditional Native American medicine and as a source of food and forage.</p>
