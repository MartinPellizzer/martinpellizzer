<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>fusca, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which resemble female insects, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a prominent lip that plays a key role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense coloration and slightly shorter petals compared to other Ophrys species.</p>
