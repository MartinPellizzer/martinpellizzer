<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>funerea, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish flowers, which resemble human faces, a feature common in the Ophrys genus.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees through visual and chemical cues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
