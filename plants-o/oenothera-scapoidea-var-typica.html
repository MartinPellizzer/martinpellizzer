                    <h1>Oenothera scapoidea var. typica</h1>
<p>Oenothera scapoidea var. typica, commonly known as the slender evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woods.</p>
<p>Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanism called "heliochasy," where the fruit twists to disperse seeds.</p>
