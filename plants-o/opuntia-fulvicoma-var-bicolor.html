                    <h1>Opuntia fulvicoma var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Opuntia fulvicoma var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are typically green with a yellowish or reddish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or purple fruits that contain edible seeds. Its spiny pads provide protection from herbivores, while its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and adaptability to dry climates.</p>
