                    <h1>Orobanche rosea</h1>
<p>Orobanche rosea, commonly known as the pink broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers and has a highly reduced structure compared to typical plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
