                    <h1>Orobanche saturejae-montanae</h1>
<p>Orobanche saturejae-montanae, commonly known as the mountain savory broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in association with species of the genus Salvia. Its life cycle involves germinating on the roots of host plants and forming a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
