                    <h1>Obetia ficifolia var. heracleifolia</h1>
<p>Obetia ficifolia var. heracleifolia, commonly known as the heracleifolia variant of the fig tree, is a tropical plant characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are often pubescent on the underside, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Moraceae family. The fruit, a small fig, develops from the female flowers and is usually enclosed within a fleshy, green or yellowish husk.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and potential fruit production.</p>
