                    <h1>Othocallis mordakiae</h1>
<p>Othocallis mordakiae, commonly known as the Mordakian bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and thrives in conditions with ample sunlight. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Othocallis mordakiae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
