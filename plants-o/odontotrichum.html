                    <h1>Odontotrichum</h1>
<p>Odontotrichum, commonly known as the toothed hairgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They are typically found in moist, temperate regions and often grow in wet meadows or along stream banks. Odontotrichum species are noted for their fine, hairy texture and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature.</p>
