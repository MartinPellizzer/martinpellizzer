                    <h1>Orobanche elatior</h1>
<p>Orobanche elatior, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agronomically significant.</p>
