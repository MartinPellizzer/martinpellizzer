                    <h1>Orchis fauriei</h1>
<p>Orchis fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring a specific symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth. Its habitat is typically moist, calcareous grasslands and woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Orchis fauriei is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
