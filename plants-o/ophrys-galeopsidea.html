<p>Ophrys galeopsidea, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a greenish-yellow flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.

Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme, with each bloom featuring a prominent lip that plays a key role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>Ophrys galeopsidea is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized reproductive strategy involving mimicry and pseudocopulation.</p>
