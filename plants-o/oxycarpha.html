<p>Oxycarpha, commonly known as the sharpleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, Oxycarpha is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, Oxycarpha is often found in rocky soils and sandy habitats.</p>
