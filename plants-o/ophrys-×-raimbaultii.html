<p>Ophrys × raimbaultii, commonly known as the Raimbault's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
