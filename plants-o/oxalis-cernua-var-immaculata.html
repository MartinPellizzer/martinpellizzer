                    <h1>Oxalis cernua var. immaculata</h1>
<p>Oxalis cernua var. immaculata, commonly known as the pale wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of true sorrel, though it lacks the edible qualities of other oxalis species.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to spread easily through rhizomes.</p>
