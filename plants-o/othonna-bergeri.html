<p>Othonna bergeri, commonly known as the Cape honeysuckle, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a bluish or greyish hue, adapted for water storage.</p>
<p>Othonna bergeri is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
