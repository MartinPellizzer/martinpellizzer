<p>Ophrys andria subsp.</p>
<p>halkionis, commonly known as the Halkionis orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. It produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
