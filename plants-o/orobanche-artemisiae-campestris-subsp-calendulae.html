                    <h1>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp. calendulae</h1>
<p>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp.</p>
<p>calendulae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often yellow or reddish stem.</p>
<p>The plant typically infests members of the Asteraceae family, such as sunflowers and daisies, and can cause significant yield losses in agricultural crops. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with host plants, including the formation of haustoria to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many cultivated areas.</p>
