                    <h1>Ophioglossum caroticaule</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum caroticaule, commonly known as the little clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, club-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically found at the tip of a short, erect stem. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a single, upright leaf that is often divided into two parts, resembling a small fern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a primitive plant with significant botanical interest.</p>
