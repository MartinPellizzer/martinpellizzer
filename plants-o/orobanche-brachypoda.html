                    <h1>Orobanche brachypoda</h1>
<p>Orobanche brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
