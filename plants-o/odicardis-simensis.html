<p>Odicardis simensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking star-shaped blue and purple petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odicardis simensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
