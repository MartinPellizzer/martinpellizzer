                    <h1>Omalotheca supina var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Omalotheca supina var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically short and cylindrical, with a rough, spiny texture that provides protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
