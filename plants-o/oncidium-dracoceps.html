<p>Oncidium dracoceps, commonly known as the Dragon's Head Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy bloom. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Oncidium dracoceps is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
