                    <h1>Olea europaea var. bifera</h1>
<p>Olea europaea var. bifera, commonly known as the bifera olive, is a rare variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bifid (split) leaves, which are narrower and more elongated compared to typical olive leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, greenish-black fruits. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive foliage and historical significance in horticulture.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its potential in olive oil production, though it is less common than the standard olive tree.</p>
