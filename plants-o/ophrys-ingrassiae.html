                    <h1>Ophrys ingrassiae</h1>
<p>Ophrys ingrassiae, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a dark brown or black lip that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority in its native region.</p>
