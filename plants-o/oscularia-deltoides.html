<p>Oscularia deltoides, commonly known as the silver leaf daisy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
