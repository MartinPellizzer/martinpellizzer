                            <h1>Orobanche Artemisiae-Campestris Subsp. Calendulae</h1>
<p>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp. calendulae is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is commonly found in regions where its host, such as the common sunflower, thrives. This species is known for its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique life cycle involves attaching to the roots of its host and drawing sustenance from it. Due to its specialized nature, it is often considered a rare and delicate component of its ecosystem.</p>
