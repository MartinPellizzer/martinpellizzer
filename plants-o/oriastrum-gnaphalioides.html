<p>Oriastrum gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its silver-gray foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
