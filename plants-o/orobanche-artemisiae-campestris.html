                    <h1>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris</h1>
<p>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that derives all its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it incapable of photosynthesis. The plant typically infests members of the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and ragworts. Its life cycle depends entirely on the presence of suitable host species for survival and reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
