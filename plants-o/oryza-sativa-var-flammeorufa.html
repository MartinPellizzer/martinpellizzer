                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. flammeorufa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. flammeorufa, commonly known as the flame-red rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its striking red grain color.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique pigmentation, which is attributed to the presence of anthocyanin pigments in the hull and bran layers. The botanical features include elongated, slender grains with a firm texture and a distinct reddish hue that intensifies when dried. It is typically grown in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate supports its growth cycle.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits typical rice morphology, with a grass-like structure and a panicle inflorescence that bears small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
