<p>Opuntia papyracantha, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in clusters of small, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia papyracantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its spiny exterior.</p>
