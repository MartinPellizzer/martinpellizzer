                    <h1>Oryza clandestina f. patens</h1>
<p>Oryza clandestina f. patens, commonly known as the hidden rice plant variant, is a rare and less-studied botanical form within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, which differ from the more common wild rice species. This form exhibits a distinct flowering pattern, with small, inconspicuous inflorescences that are often overlooked in natural settings. Its genetic makeup suggests a close relationship to other Oryza species, though its ecological role remains under investigation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, further research is needed to fully understand its botanical significance.</p>
