                    <h1>Oxypteryx curtissii</h1>
<p>Oxypteryx curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of mature trees in humid forests. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Oxypteryx curtissii is considered critically endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
