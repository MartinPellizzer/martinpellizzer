<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>untchjii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Bee Orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive bee-like hood and wing-like petals. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many parts of its range.</p>
