<p>Opuntia monticola, commonly known as the mountain prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are segmented and covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems that store water and reduced leaves that minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Opuntia monticola plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
