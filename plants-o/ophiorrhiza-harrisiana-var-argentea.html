                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza harrisiana var. argentea</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza harrisiana var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf marshmallow, is a variant of the Ophiorrhiza genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, pubescent hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
