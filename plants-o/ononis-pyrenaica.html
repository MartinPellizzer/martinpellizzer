<p>Ononis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
