<p>Ophrys gottfriediana subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the elegant bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, orchid-like appearance with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
