<p>Ophrys transhyrcana subsp.</p>
<p>mouterdeana, commonly known as the Mouterdean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its pollination mechanism.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
