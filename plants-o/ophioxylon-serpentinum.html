                    <h1>Ophioxylon serpentinum</h1>
<p>Ophioxylon serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentwood, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, winding stem that resembles a serpent.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces dark, woody fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophioxylon serpentinum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
