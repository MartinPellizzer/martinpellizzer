                    <h1>Omphalogramma coxii</h1>
<p>Omphalogramma coxii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
