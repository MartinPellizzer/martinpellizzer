                    <h1>Ophidion cymbula</h1>
<p>Ophidion cymbula, commonly known as the common water frog, is a species of frog found in various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and distinctive appearance, with a smooth, moist skin that helps it thrive in aquatic environments. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as Ophidion cymbula is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to discuss.</p>
