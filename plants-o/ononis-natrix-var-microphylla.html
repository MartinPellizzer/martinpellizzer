                    <h1>Ononis natrix var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Ononis natrix var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited to coastal and coastal grassland habitats due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
