                    <h1>Orchis × navarrensis</h1>
<p>Orchis × navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that bears a dense spike of flowers, typically ranging in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions.</p>
