<p>Opuntia ochrocentra, commonly known as the yellow centring prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia ochrocentra thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert ecosystems.</p>
