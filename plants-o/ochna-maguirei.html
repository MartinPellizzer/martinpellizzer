<p>Ochna maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's ochna, is a rare and endemic shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are followed by distinctive, woody capsules as fruits. Ochna maguirei thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
