<p>Oligactis pichinchensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricately patterned flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in the humid, shaded conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligactis pichinchensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
