                    <h1>Ochradenus spartioides</h1>
<p>Ochradenus spartioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low water conditions. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
<p>Ochradenus spartioides is also an important food source for certain desert animals.</p>
