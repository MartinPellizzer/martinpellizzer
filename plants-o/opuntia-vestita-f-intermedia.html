                    <h1>Opuntia vestita f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Opuntia vestita f. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Prickly Pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia vestita f. intermedia is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11.</p>
