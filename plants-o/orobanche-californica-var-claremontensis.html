                    <h1>Orobanche californica var. claremontensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche californica var. claremontensis, commonly known as the Claremont dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern California.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
