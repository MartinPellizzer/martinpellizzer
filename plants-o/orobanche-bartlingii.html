                    <h1>Orobanche bartlingii</h1>
<p>Orobanche bartlingii, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a parasitic connection.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
