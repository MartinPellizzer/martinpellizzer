<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves that are often green with a reddish or brownish hue on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium, which are arranged in a row along the underside of the fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
