<p>Opuntia crinifera, commonly known as the silky prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in dense clusters of soft, white bristles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia crinifera is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit.</p>
