                    <h1>Orchis patens var. spitzelii</h1>
<p>Orchis patens var. spitzelii, commonly known as the Spitzel's early orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
