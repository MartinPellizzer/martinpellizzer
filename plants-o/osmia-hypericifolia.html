                    <h1>Osmia hypericifolia</h1>
<p>Osmia hypericifolia, commonly known as the hypericum leaf mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized bee with a hairy body and typically black or dark brown coloration. The female constructs small, oval-shaped nests in hollow stems or plant stems, where she lays a single egg per cell. Osmia hypericifolia primarily forages on flowers of the genus Hypericum, such as St. John's wort, and plays a role in pollination.</p>
<p>Its behavior and nesting habits make it an important pollinator in its native habitats.</p>
