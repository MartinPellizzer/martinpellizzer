<p>Opuntia engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>laevis, commonly known as the Englemann's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
