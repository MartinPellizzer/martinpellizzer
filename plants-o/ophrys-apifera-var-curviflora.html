<p>Ophrys apifera var. curviflora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure that closely resembles a bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, hairy labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this orchid are highly adapted to its specialized pollination mechanism, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution.</p>
