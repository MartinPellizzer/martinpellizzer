                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. subflavoacies</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. subflavoacies, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a subspecies of rice characterized by its unique yellow to golden grain color.</p>
<p>This trait is primarily due to the high accumulation of beta-carotene in the endosperm, which gives it its distinctive hue. It is a genetically modified variety developed to address vitamin A deficiency in human populations. The plant exhibits typical rice morphology, with long, slender leaves and panicles that produce small, white flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural and nutritional research.</p>
