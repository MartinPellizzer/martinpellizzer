                <h1>Ophrys delilloi</h1>
<p>Ophrys delilloi, commonly known as the Delillo's bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow with dark markings, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution, Ophrys delilloi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
