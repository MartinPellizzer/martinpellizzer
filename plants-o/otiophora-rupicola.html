<p>Otiophora rupicola, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in low-nutrient, dry soils.</p>
<p>Otiophora rupicola is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with limestone or sandstone formations.</p>
