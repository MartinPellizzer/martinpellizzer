                    <h1>Ophrys epeirophora</h1>
<p>Ophrys epeirophora, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe, particularly Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like labellum that attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys epeirophora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
