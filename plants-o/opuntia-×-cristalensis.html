<p>Opuntia × cristalensis, commonly known as the cristate prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in clusters of small, spineless areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its unique appearance, with its swollen, almost fleshy pads, makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Opuntia × cristalensis is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
