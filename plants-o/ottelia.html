                    <h1>Ottelia</h1>
<p>Ottelia, commonly known as water buttercup, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically rounded with a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy and water repellence. Ottelia species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
