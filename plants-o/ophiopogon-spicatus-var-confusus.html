                    <h1>Ophiopogon spicatus var. confusus</h1>
<p>Ophiopogon spicatus var. confusus, commonly known as the fuzzy spathiphyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage rather than its flowers, and it is often used in ground cover applications.</p>
