                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza wongiana</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza wongiana, commonly known as the Wong's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as Dipterocarps, and derives some of its nutrients through a specialized root system called haustoria. Its small, leathery leaves are typically arranged in pairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza wongiana plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various insect species.</p>
