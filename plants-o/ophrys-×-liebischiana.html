                    <h1>Ophrys × liebischiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × liebischiana, commonly known as the Liebisch's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. It has a short, upright stem with few leaves and produces a single spike of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several countries.</p>
