                    <h1>Opuntia leptocaulis</h1>
<p>Opuntia leptocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia leptocaulis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
