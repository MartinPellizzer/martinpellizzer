<p>Ophrys cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys cretensis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity.</p>
