                    <h1>Orobanche arvensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche arvensis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with a fleshy, branched stem. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, making it a significant weed in farming areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle and parasitic nature make it a challenge for crop management.</p>
