                    <h1>Ossaea coriacea</h1>
<p>Ossaea coriacea, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Ossaea coriacea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions.</p>
