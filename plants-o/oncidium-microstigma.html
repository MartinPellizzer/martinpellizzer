<p>Oncidium microstigma, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming in clusters along the stems. Oncidium microstigma thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
