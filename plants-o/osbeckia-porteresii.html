                    <h1>Osbeckia porteresii</h1>
<p>Osbeckia porteresii, commonly known as the Pacific coast sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and coastal regions of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind exposure. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of pink or reddish flowers in early summer. Its growth habit is prostrate, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Osbeckia porteresii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
