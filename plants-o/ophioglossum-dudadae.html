<p>Ophioglossum dudadae, commonly known as the African adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the humid forests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the most primitive groups of ferns. The plant has a distinctive, tongue-shaped sporophyll that resembles a snake's mouth, giving it its common name. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a single, terminal umbel.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum dudadae is characterized by its unique morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf that is often divided into segments.</p>
