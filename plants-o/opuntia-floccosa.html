                    <h1>Opuntia floccosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems, which provides insulation and protection from extreme temperatures and herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia floccosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
