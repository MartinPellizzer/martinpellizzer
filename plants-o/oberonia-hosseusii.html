                    <h1>Oberonia hosseusii</h1>
<p>Oberonia hosseusii, commonly known as the Hoss√©'s orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia hosseusii is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
