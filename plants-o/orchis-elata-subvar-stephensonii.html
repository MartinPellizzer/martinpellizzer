<p>Orchis elata subvar. stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephenson's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with a single, showy flower that is usually purple or violet in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many orchid species.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and floral morphology.</p>
