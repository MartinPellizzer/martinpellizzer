                    <h1>Orobanche coccinea</h1>
<p>Orobanche coccinea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as tomatoes and other members of the Solanaceae family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are often mistaken for those of its host. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the presence of a suitable host, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield and health of its host plants.</p>
