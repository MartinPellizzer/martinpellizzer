<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>spectabilis, commonly known as the showy bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology. The plant features a single, erect stem that bears a single, large, showy flower with a distinctive lower lip that mimics the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>Its native habitat includes rocky soils in the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which relies on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudostamen.</p>
<p>It is a rare and protected plant, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe.</p>
