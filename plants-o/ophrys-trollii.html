                    <h1>Ophrys trollii</h1>
<p>Ophrys trollii, commonly known as the Troll's Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like appearance, with a complex flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Ophrys trollii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
