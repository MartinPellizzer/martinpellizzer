                    <h1>Orobanche maritima</h1>
<p>Orobanche maritima, commonly known as the sea broom or sea dodder, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems by interacting with various host species.</p>
