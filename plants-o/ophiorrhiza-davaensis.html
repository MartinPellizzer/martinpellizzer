<p>Ophiorrhiza davaensis, commonly known as the Davao mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows as a parasite on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or yellowish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Ophiorrhiza davaensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
