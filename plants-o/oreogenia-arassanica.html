                    <h1>Oreogenia arassanica</h1>
<p>Oreogenia arassanica, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Oreogenia arassanica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
