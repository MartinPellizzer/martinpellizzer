                    <h1>Orobanche berthelotii</h1>
<p>Orobanche berthelotii, commonly known as the Berthelot's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, as it attaches to the roots of its host plants. It is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize slightly but primarily depends on its host for sustenance.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can sometimes be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
