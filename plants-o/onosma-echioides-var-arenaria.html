                    <h1>Onosma echioides var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Onosma echioides var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, often blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens.</p>
