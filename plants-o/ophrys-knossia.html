                    <h1>Ophrys knossia</h1>
<p>Ophrys knossia, commonly known as the Knossian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a female face, a trait known as pseudocopulation, designed to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female insects. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
