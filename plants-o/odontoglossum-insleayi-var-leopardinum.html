<p>Odontoglossum insleayi var. leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous showy, violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns resembling leopard spots. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
