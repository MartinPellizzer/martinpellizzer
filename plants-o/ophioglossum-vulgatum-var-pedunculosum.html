                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pedunculosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pedunculosum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, lance-shaped leaf with a prominent midrib and a specialized, spurred structure at the base of the frond. The plant produces spores in small, club-shaped sporangia that are clustered in a terminal, fleshy structure called a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
