                    <h1>Orchis rassautae</h1>
<p>Orchis rassautae, commonly known as the Rassaut's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to specific pollinators, which contribute to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
