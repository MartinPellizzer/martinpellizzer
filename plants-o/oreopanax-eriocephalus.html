<p>Oreopanax eriocephalus, commonly known as the velvet-leaf sycamore, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Oreopanax eriocephalus typically grows as an understory plant in humid, shaded environments, and it is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
