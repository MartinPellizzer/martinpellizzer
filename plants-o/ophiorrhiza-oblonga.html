                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza oblonga</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
