<p>Ophrys passionis subsp.</p>
<p>castri-caesaris, commonly known as the Caesar's Castri orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which includes a strikingly complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-pollinated flowers with a rich violet hue.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries.</p>
