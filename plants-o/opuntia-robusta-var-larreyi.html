<p>Opuntia robusta var. larreyi, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Opuntia robusta var. larreyi is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
