                    <h1>Opuntia lindheimeri var. cuija</h1>
<p>Opuntia lindheimeri var. cuija, commonly known as the Cuija prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to desert climates and contribute to its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
