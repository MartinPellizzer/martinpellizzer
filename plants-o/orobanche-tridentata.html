                    <h1>Orobanche tridentata</h1>
<p>Orobanche tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is commonly found in dry, disturbed soils in regions such as the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
