                    <h1>Orthodon exfoliatus</h1>
<p>Orthodon exfoliatus, commonly known as the peeling orthodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, thin, and papery leaves that peel away as the plant matures, revealing a smooth, green surface underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthodon exfoliatus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
