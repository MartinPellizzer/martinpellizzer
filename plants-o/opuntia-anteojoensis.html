The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, round berries. Opuntia anteojoensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
