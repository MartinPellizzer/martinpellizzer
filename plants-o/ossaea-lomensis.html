<p>Ossaea lomensis, commonly known as the Lomond's grass, is a rare and unique plant native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this botanical rarity from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
