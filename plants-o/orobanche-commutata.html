                    <h1>Orobanche commutata</h1>
<p>Orobanche commutata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, often emerging after the host has established itself.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and productivity of its host plants.</p>
