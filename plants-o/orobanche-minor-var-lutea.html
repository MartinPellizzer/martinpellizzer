The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth of its host plants.</p>
