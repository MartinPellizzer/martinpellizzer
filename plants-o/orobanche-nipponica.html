                    <h1>Orobanche nipponica</h1>
<p>Orobanche nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese barrenweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species through specialized structures called haustoria. This plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on the roots of various flowering plants. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive pink or purple coloration.</p>
<p>Orobanche nipponica plays a role in ecological systems as both a parasite and a potential indicator of soil health.</p>
