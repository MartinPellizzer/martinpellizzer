                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. typicum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf called a sporophyll.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant produces two types of leaves: a sterile, compound leaf and a sporophyll that contains spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structure is highly specialized, with spores released from the sporophyll in a unique, spiral arrangement.</p>
