<p>Oxydectes metallica, commonly known as the metallic oxysome, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking metallic blue and silver foliage, which reflects light in a unique way. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oxydectes metallica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
