<p>Opuntia polyacantha subsp.</p>
<p>nicholii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are typically green with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems serve as the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
