                    <h1>Orobanche mongolica</h1>
<p>Orobanche mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various species within the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to regions of Central Asia, including Mongolia and parts of Russia. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
