                    <h1>Orobanche campuliflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche campuliflora, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on the presence of specific host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
