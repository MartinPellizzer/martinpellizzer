<p>Ophrys bivalvata, commonly known as the two-valved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small, pale green to yellowish in color, and often have intricate patterns that aid in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ophrys bivalvata is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
