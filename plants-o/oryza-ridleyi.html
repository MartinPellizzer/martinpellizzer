<p>Oryza ridleyi, commonly known as Ridley's rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and flooded grasslands. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with pale yellow to white florets. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Oryza ridleyi is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
