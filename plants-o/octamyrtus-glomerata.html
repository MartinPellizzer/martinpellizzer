                    <h1>Octamyrtus glomerata</h1>
<p>Octamyrtus glomerata, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to salty air and sandy soils makes it a common sight in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Octamyrtus glomerata reflect its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
