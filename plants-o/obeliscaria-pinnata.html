                    <h1>Obeliscaria pinnata</h1>
<p>Obeliscaria pinnata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and saline conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Obeliscaria pinnata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
