                    <h1>Orobanche libanotidis</h1>
<p>Orobanche libanotidis, commonly known as the Palestine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with leguminous hosts such as Vicia and Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
