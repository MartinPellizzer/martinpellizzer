<p>Ophrys apifera var. urbinensis, commonly known as the honeybee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a honeybee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a brownish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations.</p>
