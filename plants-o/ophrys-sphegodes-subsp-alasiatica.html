<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>alasiatica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a bee.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance.</p>
