<p>Ophrys picta subsp.</p>
<p>nafarroana, commonly known as the Pyrenean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils at high altitudes, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
