<p>Orchis maculata subsp.</p>
<p>traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats, often in shaded areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower spike with several blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
