                    <h1>Obione patagonica</h1>
<p>Obione patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and cold environments, typically found in the Patagonian region of South America. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship where the alga provides photosynthesis, while the fungus offers structural support and protection. Its growth is slow, often forming crust-like structures on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Obione patagonica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in its harsh habitat.</p>
