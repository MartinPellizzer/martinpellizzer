<p>Ophrys incubacea subsp.</p>
<p>garganica, commonly known as the Garganica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
