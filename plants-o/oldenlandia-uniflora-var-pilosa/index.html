                            <h1>Oldenlandia Uniflora Var. Pilosa</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Oldenlandia uniflora var. pilosa, is a striking plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. Its most notable feature is its velvety, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in humid environments. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in many areas, outcompeting native flora. Understanding its biology and spread is crucial for effective ecological management.</p>
