<p>Ormocarpum verrucosum var. wombaliense, commonly known as the Wombali sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the sandy soils of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its survival in open, sandy habitats.</p>
