                            <h1>Oxalis Stricta Var. Europaea</h1>
<p>Wood sorrel, scientifically known as Oxalis stricta var. europaea, is a small, delicate herbaceous plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks. Its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled flowers make it easily recognizable, though its beauty is matched only by its mild toxicity to humans and animals. Despite its potential hazards, it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. This plant, though often overlooked, is a fascinating example of nature's resilience and adaptability.</p>
