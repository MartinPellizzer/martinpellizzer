                    <h1>Oreophilus octocornutus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus octocornutus, commonly known as the eight-horned mountain orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, multi-branched inflorescence that resembles a crown, with eight prominent floral spikes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Oreophilus octocornutus is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
