                    <h1>Odontelytrum</h1>
<p>Odontelytrum, commonly known as the toothed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, toothed edge. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Odontelytrum species are known for their small, clustered inflorescences and produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
