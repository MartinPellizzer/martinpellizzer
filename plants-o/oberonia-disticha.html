<p>Oberonia disticha, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white root sheath, which aids in water absorption.</p>
<p>Oberonia disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
