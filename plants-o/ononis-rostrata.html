<p>Ononis rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed ground. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ononis rostrata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
