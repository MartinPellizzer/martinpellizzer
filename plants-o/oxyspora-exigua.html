<p>Oxyspora exigua, commonly known as the small-spored bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Oxyspora exigua is known for its specialized adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
