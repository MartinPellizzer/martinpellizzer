<p>Odontites viscosus subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the sticky hill onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features basal rosettes of broad, fleshy, sticky leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces upright flowering stems with small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves and stems exude a sticky, sap-like substance, which is a characteristic adaptation to its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
