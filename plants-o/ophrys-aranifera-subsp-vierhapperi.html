<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>vierhapperi, commonly known as the Vierhapper's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like structure called a labellum, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
