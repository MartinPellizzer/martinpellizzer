                    <h1>Orchis latifolia var. tharandina</h1>
<p>Orchis latifolia var. tharandina, commonly known as the Tharandian broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, upright flowering stems that bear clusters of violet to purple flowers. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized roots.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
