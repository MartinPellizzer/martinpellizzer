                    <h1>Oxytropis astragaloides</h1>
<p>Oxytropis astragaloides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Oxytropis astragaloides is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
