<p>Oplismenus hirtellus subsp.</p>
<p>fasciculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
