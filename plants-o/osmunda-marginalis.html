<p>Osmunda marginalis, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of fern that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two parts, with the upper portion being narrower than the lower. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the substrate, often forming dense mats. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda marginalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
