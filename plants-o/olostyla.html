                    <h1>Olostyla</h1>
<p>Olostyla, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Olostyla plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
