<p>Oenocarpus × andersonii, commonly known as the hybrid palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus panamensis.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces large, clustered fruit that resembles a coconut, with a fibrous husk and a hard, starchy interior. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal and lowland regions.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Oenocarpus × andersonii lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Oenocarpus genus.</p>
