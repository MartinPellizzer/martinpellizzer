                    <h1>Oxalis hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Oxalis hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being hairy and heart-shaped, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early blooming habit, which adds color to gardens in late winter.</p>
<p>Oxalis hirsutissima is also noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds.</p>
