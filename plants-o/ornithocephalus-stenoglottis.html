<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, elongated lip that resembles a bird's beak, giving it its scientific name. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
