<p>Oryza sativa var. rubribarbis, commonly known as the red-barbed rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its distinctive red-colored awns on the grains.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in various culinary and agricultural contexts. The botanical features include slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves, typical of many rice species. Its grains are generally smaller than those of common rice varieties and exhibit a unique reddish hue due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments.</p>
