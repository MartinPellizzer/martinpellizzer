                    <h1>Ononis spinosa f. simplex</h1>
<p>Ononis spinosa f. simplex, commonly known as the simple spiny rockcress, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky soils and harsh climates.</p>
<p>The f. simplex form is distinguished by its simpler, less branched structure compared to other forms of Ononis spinosa.</p>
