                    <h1>Orobanche interrupta</h1>
<p>Orobanche interrupta, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, making it a persistent weed.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
