                    <h1>Olearia vernicosa</h1>
<p>Olearia vernicosa, commonly known as the silverweed tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular-hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy, resinous coating, which provides some protection against pests and environmental stress.</p>
<p>Olearia vernicosa is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
