<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>minima, commonly known as the lesser bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually small, with a dark brown or blackish coloration, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
