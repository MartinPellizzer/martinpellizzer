<p>Octolepis pierreana, commonly known as the Pierre's fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as streams and wetlands, where it attaches to rocks or submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it in place and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
