<p>Onobrychis montana subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native environments.</p>
