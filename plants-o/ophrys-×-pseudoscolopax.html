                    <h1>Ophrys × pseudoscolopax</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pseudoscolopax, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that feature intricate patterns and colors resembling female bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a labellum that plays a key role in pollination by attracting male bees.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits a complex genetic structure due to its hybrid origin, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and evolutionary studies.</p>
