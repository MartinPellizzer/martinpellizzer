                    <h1>Odontochilus buruensis</h1>
<p>Odontochilus buruensis, commonly known as the Buru toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Indonesian island of Buru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on its leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and pale green, often with a subtle fragrance, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Odontochilus buruensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
