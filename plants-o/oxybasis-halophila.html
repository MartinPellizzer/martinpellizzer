                <h1>Oxybasis halophila</h1>
<p>Oxybasis halophila, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oxybasis halophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
