                    <h1>Ophrys × surdi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × surdi, commonly known as the deaf orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and they emit a subtle scent to further mimic the wasp.</p>
<p>Ophrys × surdi is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination networks.</p>
