                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera f. squalida</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera f. squalida, commonly known as the squalid bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
