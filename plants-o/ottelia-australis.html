<p>Ottelia australis, commonly known as the Australian water-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Ottelia australis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
