                    <h1>Orchis salina</h1>
<p>Orchis salina, commonly known as the saltmeadow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it has adapted to high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant features a tall, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, arranged in a spike and resembling orchid-like structures.</p>
<p>Orchis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms.</p>
