<p>Opuntia griffithsiana, commonly known as the Griffiths' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism.

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Opuntia griffithsiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
