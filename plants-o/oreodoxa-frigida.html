                    <h1>Oreodoxa frigida</h1>
<p>Oreodoxa frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the southernmost regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, cold climates with minimal sunlight and nutrient-poor soil. Oreodoxa frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme environment.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in one of the most challenging ecosystems on Earth.</p>
