                    <h1>Ophthalmoblapton parviflorum</h1>
<p>Ophthalmoblapton parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered eye-plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant possesses a unique adaptation of having tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophthalmoblapton parviflorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
