<p>Olearia virgata subsp.</p>
<p>serpentina, commonly known as the coastal daisy or serpentine olearia, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in coastal environments, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
