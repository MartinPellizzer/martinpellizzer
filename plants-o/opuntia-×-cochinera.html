                    <h1>Opuntia × cochinera</h1>
<p>Opuntia × cochinera, commonly known as the cochineal cactus, is a hybrid species within the Opuntia genus, native to the arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems, which are often covered in a thick layer of white wax. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. Its cladodes, or flattened stems, are used for photosynthesis and water storage, adapting to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia × cochinera is also notable for its historical use in the production of cochineal dye, derived from the insects that inhabit its stems.</p>
