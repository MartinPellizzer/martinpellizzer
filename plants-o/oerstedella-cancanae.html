                    <h1>Oerstedella cancanae</h1>
<p>Oerstedella cancanae, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, specifically a member of the conifer family, and is characterized by its unique, elongated cones and needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
