<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. aeginensis, commonly known as the Aeginian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
