                    <h1>Orthilia</h1>
<p>Orthilia, commonly known as the "buttercup moss," is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Orthilia has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
