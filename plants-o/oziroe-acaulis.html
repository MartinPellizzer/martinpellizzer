<p>Oziroe acaulis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, intricate flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky and arid environments, which contributes to its scarcity in the wild. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with a distinctive, spurred shape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oziroe acaulis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
