                    <h1>Orobanche ventricosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche ventricosa, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, hooded flowers that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes or other herbaceous plants. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, dry seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
