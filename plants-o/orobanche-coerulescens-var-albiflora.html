                    <h1>Orobanche coerulescens var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche coerulescens var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
