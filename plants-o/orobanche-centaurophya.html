                    <h1>Orobanche centaurophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche centaurophya, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as Astragalus and Medicago, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the presence of a suitable host, and it does not perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Orobanche centaurophya is often found in Mediterranean regions and can be a concern for agricultural crops.</p>
