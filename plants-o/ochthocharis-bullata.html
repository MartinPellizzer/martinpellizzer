<p>Ochthocharis bullata, commonly known as the bullate lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, rounded lobes and a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Ochthocharis bullata is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
