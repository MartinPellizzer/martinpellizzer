                    <h1>Ophrys dyris f. kelleri</h1>
<p>Ophrys dyris f. kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
