<p>Otostegia modesta var. buranensis, commonly known as the Buran sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in sandy soils with poor nutrients.</p>
<p>Otostegia modesta var. buranensis is often found in dunes and other dry, open habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
