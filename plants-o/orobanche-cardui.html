                    <h1>Orobanche cardui</h1>
<p>Orobanche cardui, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species within the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it an important indicator of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
