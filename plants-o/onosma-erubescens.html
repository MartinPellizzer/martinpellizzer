                    <h1>Onosma erubescens</h1>
<p>Onosma erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Onosma erubescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
