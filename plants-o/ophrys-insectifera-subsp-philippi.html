<p>Ophrys insectifera subsp.</p>
<p>philippi, commonly known as the Philippi's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, particularly its labellum, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, orange, and brown, creating a striking visual resemblance to its pollinator.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
