                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lusitanicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lusitanicum, commonly known as the Lusitanian adder's tongue, is a perennial fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf, known as a sporophyll, which is typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces a single, erect spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is located at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
