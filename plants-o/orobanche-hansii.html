                    <h1>Orobanche hansii</h1>
<p>Orobanche hansii, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions and is found in parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including grasses and legumes, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
