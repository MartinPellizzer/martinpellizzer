<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
