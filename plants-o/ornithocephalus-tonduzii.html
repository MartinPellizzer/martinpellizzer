                    <h1>Ornithocephalus tonduzii</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
