                    <h1>Odontites hydrophilis</h1>
<p>Odontites hydrophilis, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant belonging to the family Onocophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of a fern, though it is not closely related to true ferns. This plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are typically green and float just below the water's surface, allowing for efficient photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Odontites hydrophilis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
