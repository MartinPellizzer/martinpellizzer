                    <h1>Opuntia erinacea var. utahensis</h1>
<p>Opuntia erinacea var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed bristles. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun.</p>
