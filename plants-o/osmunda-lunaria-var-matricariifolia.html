                    <h1>Osmunda lunaria var. matricariifolia</h1>
<p>Osmunda lunaria var. matricariifolia, commonly known as the matricariifolia water fern, is a variant of the moon's sorrow fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the leaves of the common groundsel plant. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, emitting a faint blue glow, which is a unique botanical feature.</p>
<p>This variant is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in wetland habitats.</p>
