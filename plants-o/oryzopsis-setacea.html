<p>Oryzopsis setacea, commonly known as the silky grass or slender ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of florets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
