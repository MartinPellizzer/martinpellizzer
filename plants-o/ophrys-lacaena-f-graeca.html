                    <h1>Ophrys lacaena f. graeca</h1>
<p>Ophrys lacaena f. graeca, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
