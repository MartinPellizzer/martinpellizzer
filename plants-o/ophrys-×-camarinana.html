                    <h1>Ophrys × camarinana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × camarinana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys citrina (the yellow bee orchid).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive bee-like appearance, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering.</p>
<p>Ophrys × camarinana is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in supporting pollinator species.</p>
