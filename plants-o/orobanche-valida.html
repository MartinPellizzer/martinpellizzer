                    <h1>Orobanche valida</h1>
<p>Orobanche valida, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its highly reduced leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops like soybeans and cotton.</p>
