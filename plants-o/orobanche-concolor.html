                    <h1>Orobanche concolor</h1>
<p>Orobanche concolor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with a specialized structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like beans and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant biology and plant-host interactions.</p>
