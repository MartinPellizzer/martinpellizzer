                    <h1>Opophytum forskahlii</h1>
<p>Opophytum forskahlii, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and long, drooping branches that give it an otherworldly appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, contributing to its dense, compact form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cylindrical cones containing seeds.</p>
<p>Opophytum forskahlii is adapted to the arid and rocky environment of Socotra, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
