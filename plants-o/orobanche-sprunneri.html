                    <h1>Orobanche sprunneri</h1>
<p>Orobanche sprunneri, commonly known as the sprunner's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
