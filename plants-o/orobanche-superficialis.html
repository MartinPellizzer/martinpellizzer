                    <h1>Orobanche superficialis</h1>
<p>Orobanche superficialis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and attaching to the roots of host plants such as grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
