                    <h1>Orobanche genistae-sagittalis</h1>
<p>Orobanche genistae-sagittalis, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes such as Genista and Hippocrepis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for those of its host species. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
