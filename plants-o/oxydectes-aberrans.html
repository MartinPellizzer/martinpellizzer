                    <h1>Oxydectes aberrans</h1>
<p>Oxydectes aberrans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Oxydectes aberrans is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
