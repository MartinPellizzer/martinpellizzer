<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>lesbis, commonly known as the Lesbia's Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
