<p>Odontoglossum astranthum, commonly known as the star-shaped orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often pink or purple with a distinctive star-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild.</p>
