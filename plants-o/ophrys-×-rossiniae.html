                    <h1>Ophrys × rossiniae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × rossiniae, commonly known as the Rossinian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a fuzzy, yellowish labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats across Europe. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, and its leaves are linear and grass-like.</p>
<p>Ophrys × rossiniae is a short-lived perennial, often found in shaded environments where it thrives in the presence of its specific pollinators.</p>
