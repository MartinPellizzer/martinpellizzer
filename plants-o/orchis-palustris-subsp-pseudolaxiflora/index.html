                            <h1>Orchis Palustris Subsp. Pseudolaxiflora</h1>
<p>Purple marsh orchid, scientifically known as Orchis palustris subsp. pseudolaxiflora, is a rare and delicate wildflower that thrives in wetland habitats across Europe. Its striking purple blooms, often tinged with pink, make it a standout among orchid species. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and relatively small, clustered flowers compared to its close relatives. It plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is often found in peat bogs and damp meadows. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the Purple marsh orchid faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
