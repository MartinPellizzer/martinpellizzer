                    <h1>Ophrys × scontusiana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × scontusiana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. This plant is notable for its intricate floral morphology, particularly its lip, which closely resembles the female bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The orchid typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland or heathland areas.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with a distinctive pattern that enhances its mimicry of insect forms.</p>
