<p>Oreogrammitis viridula, commonly known as the green wall-rush, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or shaded soil. The fronds are lance-shaped, with a waxy, glossy surface that helps reduce water loss. It typically grows in temperate regions, often found in mountainous or forested areas.</p>
<p>This plant plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates.</p>
