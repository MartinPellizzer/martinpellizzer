<p>Opuntia rosea, commonly known as the rose prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in bright pink to red spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Opuntia rosea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
