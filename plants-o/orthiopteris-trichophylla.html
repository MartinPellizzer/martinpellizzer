<p>Orthiopteris trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The hairy shield fern plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
