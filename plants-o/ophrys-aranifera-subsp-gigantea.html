<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>gigantea, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination strategy and its role in the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
