                    <h1>Ophrys lorenae</h1>
<p>Ophrys lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a strong, often sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys lorenae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
