                    <h1>Osmanthus aquifolium var. variegatus-nanus</h1>
<p>Osmanthus aquifolium var. variegatus-nanus, commonly known as the variegated dwarf osmanthus, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking yellow-white variegation, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late autumn, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is ideal for rock gardens, containers, or as a specimen plant in smaller spaces.</p>
