                    <h1>Orobanche comosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche comosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
