<p>Orchis maculata var. sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic spotted orchid, is a rare and protected species native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy violet-blue flower that has a distinctive dark purple or brownish blotch on the lower lip. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
