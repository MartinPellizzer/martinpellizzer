                    <h1>Otites × pseudotites</h1>
<p>Otites × pseudotites, commonly known as the hybrid false orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Otites tenuis and Otites lutea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that typically feature a combination of purple and white hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly observed in the wild.</p>
