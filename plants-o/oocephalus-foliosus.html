                    <h1>Oocephalus foliosus</h1>
<p>Oocephalus foliosus, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified to form a spongy, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oocephalus foliosus plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
