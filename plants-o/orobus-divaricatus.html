<p>Orobus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are borne on slender stems and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and moths.</p>
