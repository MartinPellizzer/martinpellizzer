                    <h1>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. cruciata</h1>
<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. cruciata, commonly known as the Iron Horse Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the shape and color of a male horse's testicle, a mimicry strategy used to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are predominantly green with brown and yellow markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
