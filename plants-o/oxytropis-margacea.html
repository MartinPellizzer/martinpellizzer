                    <h1>Oxytropis margacea</h1>
<p>Oxytropis margacea, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces, enabling it to conserve water efficiently. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Oxytropis margacea is also known for its toxic properties, which can affect livestock that graze on it.</p>
