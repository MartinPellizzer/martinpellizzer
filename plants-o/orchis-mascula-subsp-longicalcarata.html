<p>The plant has a unique morphology, with long, narrow leaves and a distinctive, spurred lip on its flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
