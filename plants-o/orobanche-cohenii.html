<p>Orobanche cohenii, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that coil around host plants. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Astragalus and Crotalaria. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive tubular shape and five petals.</p>
<p>Orobanche cohenii is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often in sandy soils where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
