<p>Ochna obtusata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ochna, is a small shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
