                    <h1>Ophrys × etrusca</h1>
<p>Ophrys × etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. The plant produces showy, bee-shaped flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its floral structure includes a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen, enhancing its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × etrusca typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
