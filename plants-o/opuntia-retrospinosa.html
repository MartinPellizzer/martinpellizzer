                    <h1>Opuntia retrospinosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia retrospinosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small spines and glochids. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia retrospinosa is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
