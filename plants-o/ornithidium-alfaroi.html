                    <h1>Ornithidium alfaroi</h1>
<p>Ornithidium alfaroi, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, pale yellow spines that provide protection from herbivores. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are strikingly bright yellow and star-shaped, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ornithidium alfaroi is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
