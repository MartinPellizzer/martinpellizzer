                    <h1>Omphacomeria acerba var. psilotoides</h1>
<p>Omphacomeria acerba var. psilotoides, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thread-like leaves and a low-growing, creeping habit. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a distinct stem and whorled arrangement of leaves, typical of the clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
