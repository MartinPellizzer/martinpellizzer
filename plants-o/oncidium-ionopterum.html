                    <h1>Oncidium ionopterum</h1>
<p>Oncidium ionopterum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of pale green or white flowers with intricate, veined patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Oncidium ionopterum is considered endangered and is often protected in its native regions.</p>
