<p>Ophrys × ozantina, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its flowers are adorned with dark markings and a prominent lip that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × ozantina is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it produces a single spike of showy, bee-like flowers.</p>
