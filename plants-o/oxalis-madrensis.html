<p>It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Oxalis madrensis thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
