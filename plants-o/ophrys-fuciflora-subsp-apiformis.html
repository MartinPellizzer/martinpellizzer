<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure that closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with dark markings, mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
