                    <h1>Opuntia horrida</h1>
<p>Opuntia horrida, commonly known as the thorny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids, small, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. Opuntia horrida is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and features make it well-suited for desert ecosystems and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
