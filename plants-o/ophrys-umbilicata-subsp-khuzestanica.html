<p>Ophrys umbilicata subsp.</p>
<p>khuzestanica, commonly known as the Khuzestan bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to western Iran. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
