<p>Opuntia speciosa, commonly known as the showy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spiny glochids and small, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a juicy, sweet pulp surrounded by a fibrous outer layer.</p>
<p>Opuntia speciosa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves.</p>
