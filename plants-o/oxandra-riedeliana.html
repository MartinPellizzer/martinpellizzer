<p>Oxandra riedeliana, commonly known as Riedel's oxandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
