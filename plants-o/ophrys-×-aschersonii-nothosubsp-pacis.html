<p>Ophrys × aschersonii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>pacis, commonly known as the Pacific orchid, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of showy, pseudobulb-like structures.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exhibits genetic variation due to crossbreeding between Ophrys aschersonii and other related species.</p>
