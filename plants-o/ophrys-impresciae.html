                    <h1>Ophrys impresciae</h1>
<p>Ophrys impresciae, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
