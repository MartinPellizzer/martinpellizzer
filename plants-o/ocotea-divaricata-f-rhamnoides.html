                    <h1>Ocotea divaricata f. rhamnoides</h1>
<p>Ocotea divaricata f. rhamnoides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or *Schinus terebinthifolius*, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the true pepper tree. The plant produces small, red drupes that are highly aromatic and contain toxic compounds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions.</p>
