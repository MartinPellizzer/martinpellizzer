                    <h1>Ornithogalum knersvlaktense</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum knersvlaktense, commonly known as the Knersvlakte star-of-Bethlem, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Knysna Forest region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is often found in small, scattered populations due to its limited habitat.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival, as it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
