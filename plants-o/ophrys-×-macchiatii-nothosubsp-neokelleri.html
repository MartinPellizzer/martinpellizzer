<p>Ophrys × macchiatii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>neokelleri, commonly known as the Neokeller's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower morphology, which includes a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a combination of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origin and specialized pollination strategy.</p>
