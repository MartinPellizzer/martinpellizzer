                    <h1>Obione spinulosa</h1>
<p>Obione spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is primarily found in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its thallus is crust-like, with a rough, spiny surface that provides structural support and protection.</p>
<p>Obione spinulosa is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
