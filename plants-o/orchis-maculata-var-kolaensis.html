                    <h1>Orchis maculata var. kolaensis</h1>
<p>Orchis maculata var. kolaensis, commonly known as the Kola Island orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with distinctive black or brown spots, which aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a slender stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf, with flowers emerging from the axils of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
