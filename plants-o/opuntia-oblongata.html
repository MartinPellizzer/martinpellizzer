                    <h1>Opuntia oblongata</h1>
<p>Opuntia oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spineless stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia oblongata is adapted to withstand extreme drought and temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient desert plant.</p>
