<p>Oxalis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Oxalis calcicola is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
