                    <h1>Ophrys × drumana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × drumana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys scrobiculata (the helmet orchid), resulting in a plant with a distinctive appearance. The flower has a complex structure, including a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in various parts of Europe.</p>
