<p>Orchis pseudosambucina subsp.</p>
<p>sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
