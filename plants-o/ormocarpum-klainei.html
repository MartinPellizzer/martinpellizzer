                    <h1>Ormocarpum klainei</h1>
<p>Ormocarpum klainei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust, fibrous root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in challenging habitats.</p>
