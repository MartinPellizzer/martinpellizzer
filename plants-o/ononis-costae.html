<p>Ononis costae, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Ononis costae is well-suited to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
