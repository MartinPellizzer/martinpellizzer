<p>Ophrys bertolonii subsp.</p>
<p>balearica, commonly known as the Balearic bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited geographic distribution.</p>
