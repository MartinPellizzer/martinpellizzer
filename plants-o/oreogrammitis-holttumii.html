<p>Oreogrammitis holttumii, commonly known as the Tenerife wall-rue, is a rare fern endemic to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone substrates. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
