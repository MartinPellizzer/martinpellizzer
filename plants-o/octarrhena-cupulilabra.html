                    <h1>Octarrhena cupulilabra</h1>
<p>Octarrhena cupulilabra, commonly known as the hooded lily, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Octarrhena cupulilabra is typically found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
