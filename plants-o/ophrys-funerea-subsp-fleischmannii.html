                    <h1>Ophrys funerea subsp. fleischmannii</h1>
<p>Ophrys funerea subsp.</p>
<p>fleischmannii, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which resemble funeral shrouds, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This orchid is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, often in mountainous regions of Europe. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by certain bee species.</p>
<p>The subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat degradation and over-collection.</p>
