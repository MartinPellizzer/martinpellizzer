<p>Orobanche flava subsp.</p>
<p>flava, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize various herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops such as wheat and barley.</p>
