                    <h1>Onoclea</h1>
<p>Onoclea, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, feather-like fronds that give them a delicate, lace-like appearance. Onoclea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Their rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish coating, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their distinctive botanical appearance.</p>
