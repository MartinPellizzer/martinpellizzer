                    <h1>Opuntia echios var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Opuntia echios var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a large, sprawling cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy pads covered in sharp spines and tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior with numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
