                    <h1>Ophrys myodes</h1>
<p>Ophrys myodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>Ophrys myodes produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize new areas.</p>
