                    <h1>Orobanche mutelii var. interjecta</h1>
<p>Orobanche mutelii var. interjecta, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow and orange.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
