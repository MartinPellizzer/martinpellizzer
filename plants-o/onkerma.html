                    <h1>Onkerma</h1>
<p>Onkerma, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Onkerma thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
