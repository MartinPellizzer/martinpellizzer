                <h1>Opopanax siifolius</h1>
<p>Opopanax siifolius, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like tree that produces small, fragrant flowers and dark, aromatic seeds. The plant is valued for its resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal preparations. Its limited distribution and slow growth rate make it highly susceptible to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
