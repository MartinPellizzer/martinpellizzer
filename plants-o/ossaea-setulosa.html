<p>Ossaea setulosa, commonly known as the coastal sandspit grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Ossaea setulosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
