                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. incisum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant has a unique morphology with a short, erect stem and a single, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two parts. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaf, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
