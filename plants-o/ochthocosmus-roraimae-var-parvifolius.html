<p>Ochthocosmus roraimae var. parvifolius, commonly known as the Roraima starling tree, is a rare and unique species native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
