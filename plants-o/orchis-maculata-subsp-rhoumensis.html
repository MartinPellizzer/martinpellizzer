<p>Orchis maculata subsp.</p>
<p>rhoumensis, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with dark markings, which help in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often associated with other rare flora in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
