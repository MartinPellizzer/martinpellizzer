<p>Orostachys malacophylla subsp.</p>
<p>lioutchenngoi, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
