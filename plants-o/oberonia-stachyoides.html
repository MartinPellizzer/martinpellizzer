                    <h1>Oberonia stachyoides</h1>
<p>Oberonia stachyoides, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, with its roots anchored in the bark of its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), helping it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Oberonia stachyoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
