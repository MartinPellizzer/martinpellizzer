<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including some grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a hemiparasite.</p>
