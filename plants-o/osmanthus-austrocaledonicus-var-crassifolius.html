<p>Osmanthus austrocaledonicus var. crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved osmanthus, is a species native to the Pacific islands of Oceania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are broader and thicker than those of the typical osmanthus species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty horticultural collections.</p>
