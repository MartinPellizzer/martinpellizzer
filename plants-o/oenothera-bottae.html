                    <h1>Oenothera bottae</h1>
<p>Oenothera bottae, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera bottae is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths, due to its night-blooming nature.</p>
