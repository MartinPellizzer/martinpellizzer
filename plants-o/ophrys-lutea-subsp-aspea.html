<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>aspea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its flowers are yellow with intricate patterns and a unique lip that plays a key role in the pollination process.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
