                    <h1>Oberonia beccarii</h1>
<p>Oberonia beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its roots are mycoheterotrophic, meaning they rely on fungi for nutrients, which is a unique adaptation in orchids.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
