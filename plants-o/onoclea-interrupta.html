<p>Onoclea interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a segmented, bipinnate leaf that gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Onoclea interrupta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration processes.</p>
