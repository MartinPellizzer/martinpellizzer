                    <h1>Orchis × ladurneri</h1>
<p>Orchis × ladurneri, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This hybrid is relatively rare and is often found in regions with suitable climatic and soil conditions.</p>
