                    <h1>Odontophyllum gilvum</h1>
<p>Odontophyllum gilvum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces bright yellow berries that are an important food source for various bird species. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to a limited extent. Its unique ecological role involves both parasitism and mutualism with its host.</p>
<p>Odontophyllum gilvum is often found in dense forests and is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
