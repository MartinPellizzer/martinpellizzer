                    <h1>Oryzopsis hackelii</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis hackelii, commonly known as the desert barley or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and drought-resistant physiology.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis hackelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
