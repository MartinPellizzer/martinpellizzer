<p>Oberonia rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Oberonia rhizomatosa is often found in moist, shaded undergrowth of tropical rainforests.</p>
