                    <h1>Omphalium</h1>
<p>Omphalium, commonly known as the "navel moss," is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic liverworts.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant's structure consists of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Omphalium species are characterized by their distinctive, often spherical or club-shaped sporophytes that produce spores.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
