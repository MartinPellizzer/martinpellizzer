<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>gortynia, commonly known as the Gortynian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and a prominent, bee-like lip that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
