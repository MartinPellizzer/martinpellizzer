                    <h1>Orobanche pachypoda</h1>
<p>Orobanche pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, fleshy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
