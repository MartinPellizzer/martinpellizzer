                    <h1>Oligosporus emarginatus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus emarginatus, commonly known as the marginal spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often slightly overlapping, giving it a dense appearance. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located at the margins of the leaves. Oligosporus emarginatus thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important component of bryophyte communities in temperate regions.</p>
