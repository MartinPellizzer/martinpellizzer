<p>Orostachys chlorantha, commonly known as the blue-green sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Orostachys chlorantha is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
