<p>Oreogrammitis forbesiana, commonly known as the Forbes' rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 inches long. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis forbesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
