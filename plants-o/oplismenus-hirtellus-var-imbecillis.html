<p>Oplismenus hirtellus var. imbecillis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
