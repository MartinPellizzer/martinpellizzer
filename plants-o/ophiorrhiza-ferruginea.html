                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza ferruginea</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
