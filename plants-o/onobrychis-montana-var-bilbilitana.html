                    <h1>Onobrychis montana var. bilbilitana</h1>
<p>Onobrychis montana var. bilbilitana, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil.</p>
