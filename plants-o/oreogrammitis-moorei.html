<p>Oreogrammitis moorei, commonly known as the Moore's rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis moorei is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving ferns.</p>
