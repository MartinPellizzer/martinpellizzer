<p>Orobanche monoclonos, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and wild plants.</p>
