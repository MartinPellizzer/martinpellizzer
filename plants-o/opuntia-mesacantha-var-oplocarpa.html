                    <h1>Opuntia mesacantha var. oplocarpa</h1>
<p>Opuntia mesacantha var. oplocarpa, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, spiny stems that often form low, sprawling shrubs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
