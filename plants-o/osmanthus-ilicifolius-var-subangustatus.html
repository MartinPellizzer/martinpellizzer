<p>Osmanthus ilicifolius var. subangustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved osmanthus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard osmanthus species. The plant produces fragrant yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late autumn and are highly valued for their aromatic properties. These flowers are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in temperate climates.</p>
