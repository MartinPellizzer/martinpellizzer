                    <h1>Orchis cyrilli</h1>
<p>Orchis cyrilli, commonly known as the Cyrill's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces violet-blue to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
