                    <h1>Opuntia bispinosa</h1>
<p>Opuntia bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically harvested in the summer. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia bispinosa is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for various desert animals.</p>
