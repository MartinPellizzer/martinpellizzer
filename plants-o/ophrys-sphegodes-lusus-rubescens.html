<p>Ophrys sphegodes lusus rubescens, commonly known as the red-bellied bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive red-brown coloration on the lower part of the labellum. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
