                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. parnellii</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. parnellii, commonly known as the Parnell rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its grains are smaller and less productive compared to cultivated rice varieties.</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with domesticated rice.</p>
