<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>leucadica, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female insects, a feature used in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its role in ecological interactions, particularly with certain bee species that are deceived into pollinating it.</p>
