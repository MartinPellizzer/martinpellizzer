                    <h1>Orobanche dhofarensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its arid habitat. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
<p>However, its limited distribution and specific host requirements make it a rare and understudied species.</p>
