                    <h1>Ochotia</h1>
<p>Ochotia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Ochotia species are often valued for their durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in construction and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
