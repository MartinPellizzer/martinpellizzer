                    <h1>Ochthephilus</h1>
<p>Ochthephilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ochthephilus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
