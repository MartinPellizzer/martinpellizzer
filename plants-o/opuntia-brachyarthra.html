                    <h1>Opuntia brachyarthra</h1>
<p>Opuntia brachyarthra, commonly known as the short-armed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and contains small, seed-filled pulp.</p>
<p>Opuntia brachyarthra is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
