                    <h1>Ophryosporus petraeus</h1>
<p>Ophryosporus petraeus, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, forming a crust-like growth on stone surfaces. The plant's structure is characterized by its thin, flat thallus that adheres tightly to substrates, allowing it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ophryosporus petraeus is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
