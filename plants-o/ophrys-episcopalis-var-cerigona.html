<p>Ophrys episcopalis var. cerigona, commonly known as the Bishop's Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
