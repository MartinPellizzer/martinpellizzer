                    <h1>Onobrychis cadmea var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Onobrychis cadmea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical crown vetch and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
