                    <h1>Oedera pungens</h1>
<p>Oedera pungens, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>The plant's spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
