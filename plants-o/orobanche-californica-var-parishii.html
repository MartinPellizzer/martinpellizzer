<p>Orobanche californica var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's yellow witch.</p>
<p>This parasitic plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the legume family. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to California and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
