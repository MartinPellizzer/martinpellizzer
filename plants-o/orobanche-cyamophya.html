                    <h1>Orobanche cyamophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche cyamophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and some grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
