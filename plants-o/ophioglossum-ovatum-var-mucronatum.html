                    <h1>Ophioglossum ovatum var. mucronatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum ovatum var. mucronatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a spore-producing structure called a sporangium at the tip. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with spores released from the sporangium rather than flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
