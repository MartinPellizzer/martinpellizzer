<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking flower that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The orchid is a hemiparasitic plant, relying on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
