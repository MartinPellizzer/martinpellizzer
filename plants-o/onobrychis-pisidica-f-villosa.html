                    <h1>Onobrychis pisidica f. villosa</h1>
<p>Onobrychis pisidica f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
