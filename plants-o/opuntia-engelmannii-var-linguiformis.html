                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. linguiformis</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. linguiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
