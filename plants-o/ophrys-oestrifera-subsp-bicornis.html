<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers have a distinctive shape with two prominent, horn-like projections on the labellum, which aid in pollination by mimicking the appearance of a female bee.</p>
<p>This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its intricate pollination mechanism and limited distribution.</p>
