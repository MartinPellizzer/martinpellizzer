<p>Onoclea scandens, commonly known as the running marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has feather-like, compound leaves that are typically bluish-green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaflets.</p>
<p>Onoclea scandens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
