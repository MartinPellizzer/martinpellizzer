                    <h1>Ongokea gore</h1>
<p>Ongokea gore, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ongokea gore is also noted for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is sometimes used in reforestation projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
