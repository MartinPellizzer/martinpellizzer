<p>Ononis spinescens, commonly known as prickly evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces yellow flowers in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has hairy, spiny stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ononis spinescens is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
