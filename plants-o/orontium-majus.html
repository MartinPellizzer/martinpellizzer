<p>Orontium majus, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are covered in a waxy layer, which helps repel water. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces fruit that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Orontium majus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
