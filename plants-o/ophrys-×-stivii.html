<p>Ophrys × stivii, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its floral morphology is highly specialized, with a complex structure that includes a labellum shaped to resemble a bee's body.</p>
<p>Ophrys × stivii is typically found in Mediterranean regions, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils and displaying a short growing season.</p>
