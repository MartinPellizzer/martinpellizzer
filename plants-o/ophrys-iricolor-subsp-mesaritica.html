<p>Ophrys iricolor subsp.</p>
<p>mesaritica, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive white, lip-like flower that resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a sweet, vanilla-like scent to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
