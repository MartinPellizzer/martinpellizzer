                    <h1>Ophrys × fassbenderi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × fassbenderi, commonly known as the Fassbender's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of Europe.</p>
