                    <h1>Ophrys holosericea var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Ophrys holosericea var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a yellowish hue, often with a distinct, elongated lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
