<p>Opuntia impedita, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, spherical fruits known as tunas. Opuntia impedita is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures.</p>
