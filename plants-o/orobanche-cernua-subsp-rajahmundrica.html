<p>Orobanche cernua subsp.</p>
<p>rajahmundrica, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a parasitic relationship.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
