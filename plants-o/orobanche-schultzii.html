                    <h1>Orobanche schultzii</h1>
<p>Orobanche schultzii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, such as those in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
