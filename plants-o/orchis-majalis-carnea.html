                    <h1>Orchis majalis carnea</h1>
<p>Orchis majalis carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a flowering stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare and is protected in several European countries due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
