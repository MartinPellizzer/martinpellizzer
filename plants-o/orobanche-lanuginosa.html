                    <h1>Orobanche lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, hairy appearance. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on agricultural crops.</p>
