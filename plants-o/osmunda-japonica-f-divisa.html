<p>Osmunda japonica f. divisa, commonly known as the divided Japanese water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender, unbranched sterile frond that is divided into narrow segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
