<p>Oncidium guianense var. alborubrum, commonly known as the Red-tinged Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange with red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
