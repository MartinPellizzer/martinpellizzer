<p>Ossaea suprabasalis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ossaea suprabasalis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
