<p>Ophrys zonata, commonly known as the zoned bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with brown and white markings, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Ophrys zonata is often found in woodland and meadow habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
