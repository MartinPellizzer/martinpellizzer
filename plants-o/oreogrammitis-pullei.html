<p>Oreogrammitis pullei, commonly known as the pullei's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, leaf-like body that is usually green or yellowish in color. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are often found at the tips of the thallus, producing spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis pullei is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanical studies.</p>
