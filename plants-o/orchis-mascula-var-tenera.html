                    <h1>Orchis mascula var. tenera</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula var. tenera, commonly known as the soft beard orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to brownish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and damp meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
