                    <h1>Opuntia cretochaeta</h1>
<p>Opuntia cretochaeta, commonly known as the Cretan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia cretochaeta plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes.</p>
