<p>Ophrys cretensis subsp.</p>
<p>samica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Crete. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its floral morphology is highly specialized, with intricate patterns and colors that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
