                    <h1>Octomeria lacerata</h1>
<p>Octomeria lacerata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the summer months. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Octomeria lacerata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
