                    <h1>Orobanche santolinae</h1>
<p>Orobanche santolinae, commonly known as the Santolina broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in Mediterranean regions and is often associated with plants of the genus Santolina.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
