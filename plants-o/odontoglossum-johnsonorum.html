                    <h1>Odontoglossum johnsonorum</h1>
<p>Odontoglossum johnsonorum, commonly known as Johnson's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
