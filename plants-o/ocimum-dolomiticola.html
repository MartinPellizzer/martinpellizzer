                    <h1>Ocimum dolomiticola</h1>
<p>Ocimum dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomite basil, is a rare and specialized species of the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the limestone-rich regions of southern Mexico, where it thrives in alkaline soils. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and purple flowers, which bloom in clusters. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous environments, making it a unique example of plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ocimum dolomiticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
