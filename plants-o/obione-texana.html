                    <h1>Obione texana</h1>
<p>Obione texana, commonly known as the Texas obione, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione texana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
