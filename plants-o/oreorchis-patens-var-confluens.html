<p>Oreorchis patens var. confluens, commonly known as the confluence orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The varietal form confluens is distinguished by the merging of the dorsal sepal and petal, creating a unique floral morphology.</p>
