                    <h1>Ornithogalum polyodontulum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum polyodontulum, commonly known as the many-toothed star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant's bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant.</p>
