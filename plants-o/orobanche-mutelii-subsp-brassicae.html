<p>Orobanche mutelii subsp.</p>
<p>brassicae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish, leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbage and mustard plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
