<p>Ophrys kurdica subsp.</p>
<p>kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking purple and yellow blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
