                    <h1>Oryza nivara</h1>
<p>Oryza nivara, commonly known as the snow rice, is a wild rice species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass with slender, hairless stalks and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its grains are smaller than those of cultivated rice and are not widely used for food but are of interest for genetic research.</p>
<p>Oryza nivara is considered a valuable resource for understanding rice evolution and improving crop resilience.</p>
