                    <h1>Oxydectes draconoides</h1>
<p>Oxydectes draconoides, commonly known as the dragon's tail plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, fleshy, dragon-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle contrast to its bold foliage. Its thick, water-storing leaves are adapted to survive in arid environments, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Oxydectes draconoides is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
