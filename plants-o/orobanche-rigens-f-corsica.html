                    <h1>Orobanche rigens f. corsica</h1>
<p>Orobanche rigens f. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize host species such as legumes. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that bloom in summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including Corsica, and is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
