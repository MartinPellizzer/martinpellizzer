                    <h1>Opuntia engelmannii var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Opuntia engelmannii var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically covered in clusters of bright yellow to orange spines. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
