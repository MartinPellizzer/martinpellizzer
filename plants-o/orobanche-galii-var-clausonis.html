                    <h1>Orobanche galii var. clausonis</h1>
<p>Orobanche galii var. clausonis, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
