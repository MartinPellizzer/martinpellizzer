                    <h1>Oxygonum fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Oxygonum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by waxy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant has a unique ability to trap water in its leaves, which helps it float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its roots are typically submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds or lakes.</p>
<p>Oxygonum fasciculatum is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
