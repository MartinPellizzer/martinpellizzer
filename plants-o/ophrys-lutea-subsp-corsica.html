<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>corsica, commonly known as the Corsican bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
