                    <h1>Oreocome</h1>
<p>Oreocome, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. Oreocome species are characterized by their slender stems, finely divided leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. They play an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provide habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to their restricted habitats, many Oreocome species are considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
