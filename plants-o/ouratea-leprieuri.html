<p>Ouratea leprieuri, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as oaks and hickories, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Ouratea leprieuri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
