<p>Orobanche salviae subsp.</p>
<p>ozanonis, commonly known as the parasitic broom weed, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with a single, erect flower cluster. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
