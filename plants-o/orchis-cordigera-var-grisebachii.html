<p>Orchis cordigera var. grisebachii, commonly known as the Greybeard Orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically pale green to greyish in color, giving it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Balkans, where it thrives in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
