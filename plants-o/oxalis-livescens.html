<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the shamrock, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers.

It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, making it relatively easy to care for.</p>
<p>Oxalis livescens is also known for its ability to produce runners, which can be used for propagation.</p>
