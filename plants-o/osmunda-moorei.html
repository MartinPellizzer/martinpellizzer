<p>Osmunda moorei, commonly known as the Moore's water fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, rhizomatous stem that anchors it in shallow water. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with both sterile and fertile pinnae, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Osmunda moorei plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
