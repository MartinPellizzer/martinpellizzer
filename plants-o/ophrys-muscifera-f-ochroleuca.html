<p>Ophrys muscifera f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow hue and a distinctive bee-like lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many areas.</p>
