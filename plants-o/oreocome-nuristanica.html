<p>Oreocome nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nuristan in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Oreocome nuristanica is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
