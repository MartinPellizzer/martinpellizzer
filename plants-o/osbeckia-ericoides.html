                    <h1>Osbeckia ericoides</h1>
<p>Osbeckia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of greenish-white to yellow, typically blooming in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to grow in moist, acidic soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Osbeckia ericoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
