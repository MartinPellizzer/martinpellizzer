<p>Opuntia neoargentina, commonly known as the Argentine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fruit-like structures called tunas. Opuntia neoargentina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions.</p>
