                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. linearis</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. linearis, commonly known as the linear bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green with dark markings, and it blooms between May and July.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
