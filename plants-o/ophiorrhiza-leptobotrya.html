                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza leptobotrya</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza leptobotrya, commonly known as the slender-fruited mangrove, is a small, woody shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests along the shores of countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing yellowish-white petals, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in the plant's dispersal in coastal areas.</p>
