<p>Ottelia ovalifolia subsp.</p>
<p>ovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water margins.</p>
