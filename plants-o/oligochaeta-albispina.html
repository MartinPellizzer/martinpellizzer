                    <h1>Oligochaeta albispina</h1>
<p>Oligochaeta albispina, commonly known as the white-spined flatworm, is a parasitic flatworm rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its flattened body and lack of a circulatory system. The species is known for its translucent body and distinctive white spines along its dorsal surface. It typically infects the intestines of various vertebrates, including humans, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in medical and veterinary parasitology.</p>
