<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are predominantly green with brownish markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
