<p>Oreobolus oxycarpus subsp.</p>
<p>brownii, commonly known as the Brown's sand couch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in sandy soils with poor nutrient content.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dunes and salt-affected soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
