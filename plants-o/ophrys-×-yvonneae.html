                    <h1>Ophrys × yvonneae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × yvonneae, commonly known as the Yvonne's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys × yvonneae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
