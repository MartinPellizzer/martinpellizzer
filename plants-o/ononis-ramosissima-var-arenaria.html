                    <h1>Ononis ramosissima var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Ononis ramosissima var. arenaria, commonly known as sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Sandrocket is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other harsh, well-drained habitats.</p>
