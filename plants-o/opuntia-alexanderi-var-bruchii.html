                    <h1>Opuntia alexanderi var. bruchii</h1>
<p>Opuntia alexanderi var. bruchii, commonly known as the Alexander's prickly pear, is a rare cactus native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to a semi-arid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
