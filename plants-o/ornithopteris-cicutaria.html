                    <h1>Ornithopteris cicutaria</h1>
<p>Ornithopteris cicutaria, commonly known as the common water fern, is a aquatic fern species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native ecosystems.</p>
