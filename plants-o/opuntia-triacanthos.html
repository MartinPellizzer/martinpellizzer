                    <h1>Opuntia triacanthos</h1>
<p>Opuntia triacanthos, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia triacanthos is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and ecologically significant plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
