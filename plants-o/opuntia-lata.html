<p>Opuntia lata, commonly known as the flat prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia lata is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates.</p>
