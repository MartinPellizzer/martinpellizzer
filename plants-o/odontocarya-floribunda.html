<p>Odontocarya floribunda, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>
