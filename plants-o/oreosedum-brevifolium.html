                    <h1>Oreosedum brevifolium</h1>
<p>Oreosedum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Oreosedum brevifolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
