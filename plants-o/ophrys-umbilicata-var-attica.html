<p>Ophrys umbilicata var. attica, commonly known as the Attic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms during the spring months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
