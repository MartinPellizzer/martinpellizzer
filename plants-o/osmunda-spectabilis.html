                    <h1>Osmunda spectabilis</h1>
<p>Osmunda spectabilis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elegant fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive fiddlehead shape in early spring. The plant has a unique life cycle, with separate sporangia-bearing and fertile fronds on the same plant. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Osmunda spectabilis is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
