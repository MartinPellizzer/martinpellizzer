                    <h1>Onobrychis supina f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Onobrychis supina f. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping bursfoot, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky, or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
