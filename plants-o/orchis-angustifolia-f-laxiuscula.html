                    <h1>Orchis angustifolia f. laxiuscula</h1>
<p>Orchis angustifolia f. laxiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a slight purple tinge, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This orchid is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance.</p>
