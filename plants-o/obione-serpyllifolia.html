                    <h1>Obione serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Obione serpyllifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, succulent stems covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments, and it often grows on rocky soils or in sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Obione serpyllifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
