                    <h1>Oreodaphne aciphylla</h1>
<p>Oreodaphne aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless oreodaphne, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study, particularly in relation to its adaptations to tropical environments.</p>
<p>Despite its leafless appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
