<p>Onosma pseudoarenaria subsp.</p>
<p>albanica, commonly known as the Albanian sand-verbena, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to its harsh environment.</p>
