<p>Octomeria medinae, commonly known as the Medina's octomeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow-orange flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Octomeria medinae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
