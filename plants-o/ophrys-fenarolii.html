                    <h1>Ophrys fenarolii</h1>
<p>Ophrys fenarolii, commonly known as the Fenarola Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys fenarolii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
