<p>Opuntia hattoniana, commonly known as the Hatton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia hattoniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
