                    <h1>Orobanche viridis</h1>
<p>Orobanche viridis, commonly known as the green broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is significant, as it can reduce crop yields and alter soil nutrient dynamics.</p>
