<p>Ophrys apifera f. friburgensis, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female honey bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate markings and a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
