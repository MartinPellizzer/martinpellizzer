                    <h1>Orobanche cannabis</h1>
<p>Orobanche cannabis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as those in the sunflower family, to extract nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure compared to typical flowering plants. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
