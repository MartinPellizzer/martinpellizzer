<p>Orobanche speciosa var. pelargonii, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent stem and leaves. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its unique appearance and lack of traditional green pigmentation make it easily recognizable.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for certain insect species.</p>
