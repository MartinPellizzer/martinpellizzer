<p>Orchis militaris subsp.</p>
<p>galeata, commonly known as the Galeate Military Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique morphology with a single leaf and a long, slender scape.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
