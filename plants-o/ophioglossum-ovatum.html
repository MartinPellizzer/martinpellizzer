                    <h1>Ophioglossum ovatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum ovatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, spore-bearing frond that emerges from a fleshy, underground rhizome. The plant has a primitive structure, with a short, thick stem and a single, elongated leaf that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
