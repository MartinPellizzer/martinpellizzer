                    <h1>Ophrys spruneri f. cretica</h1>
<p>Ophrys spruneri f. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats, such as slopes and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
