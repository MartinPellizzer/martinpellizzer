                    <h1>Onobrychis samanganica</h1>
<p>Onobrychis samanganica, commonly known as Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and its trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, warm climates. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Onobrychis samanganica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
