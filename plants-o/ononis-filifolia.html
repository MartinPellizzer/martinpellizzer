<p>Ononis filifolia, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Ononis filifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
