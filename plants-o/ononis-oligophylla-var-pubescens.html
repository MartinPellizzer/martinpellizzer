<p>Ononis oligophylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leafed whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes.</p>
