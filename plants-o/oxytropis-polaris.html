                    <h1>Oxytropis polaris</h1>
<p>Oxytropis polaris, commonly known as polar locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are often hairy and reduced in size. It is part of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Oxytropis polaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to ecologists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
