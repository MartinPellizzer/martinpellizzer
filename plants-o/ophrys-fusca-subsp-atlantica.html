<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow coloration.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
