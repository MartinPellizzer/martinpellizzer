                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. speculum</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. speculum, commonly known as the mirror orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a dark, reflective patch resembling an eye, which plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry of a female bee.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ecological significance and is considered a conservation priority due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
