<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>gottfriediana, commonly known as the Gottfried's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
