<p>Onobrychis schahuensis, commonly known as Schahuen's clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
