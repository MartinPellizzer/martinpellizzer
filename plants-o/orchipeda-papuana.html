<p>Orchipeda papuana, commonly known as the Papuan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air, a common trait among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orchipeda papuana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
