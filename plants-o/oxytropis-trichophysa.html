                    <h1>Oxytropis trichophysa</h1>
<p>Oxytropis trichophysa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis trichophysa has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
