                    <h1>Oligochaeta</h1>
<p>Oligochaeta, commonly known as earthworms, are annelid worms belonging to the subclass Oligochaeta.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their segmented bodies and the presence of setae, which are bristle-like structures used for movement. These worms play a crucial role in soil ecosystems by aerating the soil and decomposing organic matter. They are typically found in moist environments such as soil, leaf litter, and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Their presence is an indicator of healthy soil ecosystems due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
