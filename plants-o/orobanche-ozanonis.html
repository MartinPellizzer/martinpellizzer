                    <h1>Orobanche ozanonis</h1>
<p>Orobanche ozanonis, commonly known as the Turkish broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, including Turkey and parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
