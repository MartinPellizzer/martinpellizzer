<p>Oreoschimperella aberdarensis, commonly known as the Aberdare rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, including its compact growth habit and dark, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its reproductive structures are adapted to ensure successful spore dispersal in its specific habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
