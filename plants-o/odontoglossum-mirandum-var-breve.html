                    <h1>Odontoglossum mirandum var. breve</h1>
<p>Odontoglossum mirandum var. breve, commonly known as the dwarf mirror orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its short, upright stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinctive mirror-like appearance on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the diverse orchid flora of its native habitat.</p>
