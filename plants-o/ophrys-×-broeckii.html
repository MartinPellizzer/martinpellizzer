                    <h1>Ophrys × broeckii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × broeckii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as Spain and Italy. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bee-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its morphological and genetic diversity, reflecting its status as a hybrid species.</p>
