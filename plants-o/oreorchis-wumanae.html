<p>Oreorchis wumanae, commonly known as the Wumana orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip and column. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its reproductive cycle relies heavily on specific pollinators, which contributes to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oreorchis wumanae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
