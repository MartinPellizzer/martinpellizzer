                    <h1>Oxycedrus</h1>
<p>Oxycedrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypress, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of Oxycedrus are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The wood is highly aromatic and has been historically used for construction and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, Oxycedrus is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
