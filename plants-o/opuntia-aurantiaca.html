<p>Opuntia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped structures that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia aurantiaca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various cultures.</p>
