                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. fayoumensis</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. fayoumensis, commonly known as the Fayoumenese rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to Egypt.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically exhibits a pale yellow to white color when mature. This variety is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of the Nile Valley, making it resilient to drought. It has a high yield potential and is valued for its nutritional content, including a good balance of carbohydrates and proteins.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic traits, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving rice resilience in challenging climates.</p>
