                    <h1>Oreopoa</h1>
<p>Oreopoa, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plants typically grow in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where they thrive in cooler and more humid conditions. Oreopoa species are perennial herbs with strap-like leaves and are often found in rocky or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems and their role in local biodiversity.</p>
