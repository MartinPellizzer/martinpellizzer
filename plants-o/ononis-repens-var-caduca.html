<p>Ononis repens var. caduca, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its tendency to shed leaves at the end of the growing season, a characteristic that aids in its survival in harsh environments.</p>
