                    <h1>Orobanche torquata</h1>
<p>Orobanche torquata, commonly known as the twisted broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host and extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
