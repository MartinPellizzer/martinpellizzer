                    <h1>Oryza malampuzhaensis</h1>
<p>Oryza malampuzhaensis, commonly known as the Malampuzha rice, is a wild rice species native to the Indian state of Kerala.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, elliptical grains. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its reproductive structures are similar to other rice species, with panicles bearing numerous spikelets.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it holds potential for rice breeding programs aimed at improving yield and resilience.</p>
