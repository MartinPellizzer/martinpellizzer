<p>Onosma saxatilis, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone cliffs and gravelly soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Onosma saxatilis is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
