                    <h1>Ornithocephalus alfredoi</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus alfredoi, commonly known as the Alfred's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a striking, ghost-like appearance with a single, elongated flower that resembles a bird's head. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it has very specific microhabitat requirements, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
