                    <h1>Oreogrammitis velutina</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or wooded substrates. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, making it less conspicuous than typical ferns.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis velutina is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats.</p>
