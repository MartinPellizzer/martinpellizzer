                    <h1>Ophrys × geniezii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × geniezii, commonly known as the Geniez's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a prominent, yellow-brown labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, particularly in southern Europe. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys × geniezii is considered a protected species in several countries.</p>
