                    <h1>Ononis natrix var. reverchonii</h1>
<p>Ononis natrix var. reverchonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
