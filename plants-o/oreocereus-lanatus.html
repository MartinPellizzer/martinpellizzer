                    <h1>Oreocereus lanatus</h1>
<p>Oreocereus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, woolly white hair covering the stems, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
