                    <h1>Oreoleysera</h1>
<p>Oreoleysera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique genus of flowering plants native to the southern regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid conditions.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its rarity and conservation status, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
