                    <h1>Osmia hexantha</h1>
<p>Osmia hexantha, commonly known as the six-angled mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal pattern on its abdomen, which gives it its scientific name. The plant it pollinates, though not the bee itself, includes a variety of flowering plants such as fruit trees and wildflowers. Osmia hexantha plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the reproductive success of many plant species.</p>
<p>Its preference for nesting in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities makes it an important pollinator in both natural and agricultural ecosystems.</p>
