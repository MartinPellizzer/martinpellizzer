<p>[WRONG START] Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>parvimaculula, commonly known as the small-spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small, with a distinctive dark brown to black pattern on the lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
