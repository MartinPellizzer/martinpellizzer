                    <h1>Osmunda crenata</h1>
<p>Osmunda crenata, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and as ornamental plants. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Osmunda crenata has a unique ability to absorb and release gases, which helps maintain water quality in its habitat.</p>
