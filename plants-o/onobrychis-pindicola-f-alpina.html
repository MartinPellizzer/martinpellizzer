                    <h1>Onobrychis pindicola f. alpina</h1>
<p>Onobrychis pindicola f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration in mountainous environments.</p>
