                    <h1>Ophrys peraiolae</h1>
<p>Ophrys peraiolae, commonly known as the Peraiola bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys peraiolae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
