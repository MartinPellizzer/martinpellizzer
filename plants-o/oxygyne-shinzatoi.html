                    <h1>Oxygyne shinzatoi</h1>
<p>Oxygyne shinzatoi, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically requiring specific conditions for successful propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
