                    <h1>Orobanche hyperici</h1>
<p>Orobanche hyperici, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the genus Hypericum, such as St. John's wort. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
