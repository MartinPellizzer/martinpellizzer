                    <h1>Ornithidium patellum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium patellum, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Ornithidium patellum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
