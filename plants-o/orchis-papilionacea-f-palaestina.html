<p>Orchis papilionacea f. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a yellow throat, which resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect flowering stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
