                    <h1>Orobanche ramosa var. mutelii</h1>
<p>Orobanche ramosa var. mutelii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its branched, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically infests the roots of various host plants, including legumes and some grasses, in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
