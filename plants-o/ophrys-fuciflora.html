                    <h1>Ophrys fuciflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys fuciflora, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the coastal regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure that mimics the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a distinctive lip that resembles a wasp's abdomen.</p>
<p>Ophrys fuciflora is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance.</p>
