                    <h1>Onoclea struthiopteris</h1>
<p>Onoclea struthiopteris, commonly known as the common brittle bladderwort, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
