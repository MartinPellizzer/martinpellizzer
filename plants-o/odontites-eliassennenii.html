                    <h1>Odontites eliassennenii</h1>
<p>Odontites eliassennenii, commonly known as the Eliasson's toothed fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, tooth-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
