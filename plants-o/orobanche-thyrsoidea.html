                    <h1>Orobanche thyrsoidea</h1>
<p>Orobanche thyrsoidea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, such as root exudates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
