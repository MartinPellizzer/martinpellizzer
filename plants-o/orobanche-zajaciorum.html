                    <h1>Orobanche zajaciorum</h1>
<p>Orobanche zajaciorum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with reduced leaves. It typically parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialized parasite.</p>
