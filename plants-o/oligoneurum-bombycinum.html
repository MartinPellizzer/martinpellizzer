<p>Oligoneurum bombycinum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a prostrate growth habit with tightly packed, greenish-yellow rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. The plant produces small, rounded structures called gemmae, which are used for vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Oligoneurum bombycinum is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
