<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Maltese Islands. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a pseudostamen that mimics the appearance of a male bee to attract female bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
