                    <h1>Ophrys × lucronii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lucronii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate and often deceptive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to parts of southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × lucronii is a short-lived perennial, producing its striking blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
