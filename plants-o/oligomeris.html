<p>Oligomeris, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae, consists of several species native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are typically herbaceous, with alternate, lanceolate leaves that often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, and they are often found in moist or rocky habitats. Oligomeris species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
