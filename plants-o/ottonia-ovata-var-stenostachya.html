                    <h1>Ottonia ovata var. stenostachya</h1>
<p>Ottonia ovata var. stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked ottonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, pale green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to thrive in moist, boggy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its reproductive strategy relies on both self-pollination and cross-pollination, enhancing its survival in variable wetland conditions.</p>
<p>Ottonia ovata var. stenostachya is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
