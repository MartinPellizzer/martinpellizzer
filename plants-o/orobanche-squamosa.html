                    <h1>Orobanche squamosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche squamosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. It is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops.</p>
