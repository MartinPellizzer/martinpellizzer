<p>Ornithoglossum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-lipped p舌草, is a striking perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its unique, ornate flowers that resemble a bird's tongue, hence its scientific name.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
