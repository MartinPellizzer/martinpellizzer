<p>Odontarrhena lanigera, commonly known as the woolly root grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Odontarrhena lanigera is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
