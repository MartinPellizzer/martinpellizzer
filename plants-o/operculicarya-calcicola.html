                    <h1>Operculicarya calcicola</h1>
<p>Operculicarya calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola lichen, is a specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous environments, such as limestone soils and rocky substrates, where it forms a crust-like growth. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, leathery thallus that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for calcium-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
