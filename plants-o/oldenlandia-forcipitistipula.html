                    <h1>Oldenlandia forcipitistipula</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia forcipitistipula, commonly known as the swordleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by capsule fruits that disperse its seeds. It attaches to host trees using haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host, while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies on plant-host interactions.</p>
