                    <h1>Ononis angustissima var. falcata</h1>
<p>Ononis angustissima var. falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in spring, and the leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips, which give it its specific epithet "falcata.".</p>
