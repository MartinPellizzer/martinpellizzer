<p>Ophrys × moreana subsp.</p>
<p>dornheckeri, commonly known as the Dornhecker's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
