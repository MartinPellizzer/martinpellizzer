                    <h1>Otiophora inyangana</h1>
<p>Otiophora inyangana, commonly known as the Inyangana lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its greenish-yellow to brownish thallus with a distinct, finely wrinkled surface. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique appearance make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
