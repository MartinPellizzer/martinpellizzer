                    <h1>Orobanche buhsei</h1>
<p>Orobanche buhsei, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
