<p>Ochna terminalis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting.</p>
<p>Ochna terminalis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
