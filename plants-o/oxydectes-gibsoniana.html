<p>Oxydectes gibsoniana, commonly known as the Gibson's oxydectes, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxydectes gibsoniana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
