                    <h1>Ophrys jurana</h1>
<p>Ophrys jurana, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers produce nectar that attracts male bees, which in turn facilitate pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys jurana plays an important role in its ecosystem as both a pollinator attractor and a component of local biodiversity.</p>
