                    <h1>Orobanche unicolor</h1>
<p>Orobanche unicolor, commonly known as the common yellow broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host plants.</p>
