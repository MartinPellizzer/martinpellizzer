<p>Ottelia acuminata, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and marshes, and has floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ottelia acuminata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
