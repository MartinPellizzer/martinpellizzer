<p>Orobanche tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host species.</p>
