                    <h1>Onobrychis alba var. striatula</h1>
<p>Onobrychis alba var. striatula, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant.</p>
