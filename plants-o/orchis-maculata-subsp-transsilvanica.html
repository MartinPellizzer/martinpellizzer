<p>Orchis maculata subsp.</p>
<p>transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian spotted orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
