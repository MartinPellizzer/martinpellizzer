                    <h1>Ornithidium proliferum</h1>
<p>Ornithidium proliferum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, mat-forming evergreen plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates. Ornithidium proliferum is typically found in temperate forests and is an important component of forest floor ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and longevity make it a valuable indicator of undisturbed habitats.</p>
