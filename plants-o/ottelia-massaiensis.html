                    <h1>Ottelia massaiensis</h1>
<p>Ottelia massaiensis, commonly known as the African water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged, with only the stamens visible above the water. Ottelia massaiensis is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
