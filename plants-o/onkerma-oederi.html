                    <h1>Onkerma oederi</h1>
<p>Onkerma oederi, commonly known as the Oeder's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Onkerma oederi is considered endangered in many parts of its natural range.</p>
