<p>Olea europaea var. guttata, commonly known as the dotted olive, is a variant of the common olive tree characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy surface and are marked by small, raised, yellowish dots along the veins. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in warm, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible fruits, though the fruit of this variety is often smaller and less oily than that of the common olive.</p>
