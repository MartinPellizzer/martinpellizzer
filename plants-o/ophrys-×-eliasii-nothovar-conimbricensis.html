<p>Ophrys × eliasii nothovar. conimbricensis, commonly known as the Portuguese bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Portugal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>This nothovar is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and unique pollination strategy.</p>
