                    <h1>Orobanche nudiflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with host plants, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
