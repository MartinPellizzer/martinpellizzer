                    <h1>Orchidium boreale</h1>
<p>Orchidium boreale, commonly known as the northern orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants, though most are not adapted to such extreme climates. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy areas, where it can withstand the cold and short growing season. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Orchidium boreale is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
