                    <h1>Orobanche cicerbitae</h1>
<p>Orobanche cicerbitae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, branched stem that emerges from the soil. It typically parasitizes leguminous plants such as vetch and clover, weakening its host by drawing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
