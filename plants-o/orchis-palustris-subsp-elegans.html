<p>Orchis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the elegant marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of strikingly pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip.</p>
<p>The plant has a complex root system and produces a rosette of lance-shaped leaves at the base. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
