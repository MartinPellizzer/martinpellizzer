                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. montana</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain rice, is a wild rice species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, often thriving in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, rice-like grains that are typically brown or yellow in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is considered an important genetic resource for rice breeding programs.</p>
