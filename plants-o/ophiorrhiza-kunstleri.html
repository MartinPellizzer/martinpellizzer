                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza kunstleri</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza kunstleri, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline and waterlogged soils, including the presence of pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures for gas exchange. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. Ophiorrhiza kunstleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
