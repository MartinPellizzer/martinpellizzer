<p>Ocellochloa soderstromii, commonly known as the Soderstrom's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Ocellochloa soderstromii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic invertebrates.</p>
