<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>minuscula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in grasslands or heaths. Its flowers are small and have intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
