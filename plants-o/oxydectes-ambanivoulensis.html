<p>Oxydectes ambanivoulensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
