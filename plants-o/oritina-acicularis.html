<p>Oritina acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf oritina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in the spring. Oritina acicularis thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
