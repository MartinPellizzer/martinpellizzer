                    <h1>Orobanche humbertii</h1>
<p>Orobanche humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germination dependent on specific host species. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
