                    <h1>Ophrys omegaifera var. basilissa</h1>
<p>Ophrys omegaifera var. basilissa, commonly known as the Basilissa bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a distinctive, hooded labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
