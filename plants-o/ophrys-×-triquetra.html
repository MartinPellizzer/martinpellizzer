                    <h1>Ophrys × triquetra</h1>
<p>Ophrys × triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces dark brown, three-lobed pseudobulbs and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × triquetra thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
