                    <h1>Oryza collina</h1>
<p>Oryza collina, commonly known as the mountain rice or dwarf rice, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces compact panicles of white to pale yellow flowers, which give way to small, oval grains resembling rice. Oryza collina is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of grassland ecosystems and plant adaptation.</p>
