<p>Oberonia biaurita, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, two-lobed lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Oberonia biaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
