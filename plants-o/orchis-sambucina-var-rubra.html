                    <h1>Orchis sambucina var. rubra</h1>
<p>Orchis sambucina var. rubra, commonly known as the red marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, red to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies or in marshy areas. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, featuring both male and female reproductive structures, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its association with certain fungal partners, which aid in nutrient absorption through mycorrhizal relationships.</p>
