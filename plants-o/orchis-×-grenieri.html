                    <h1>Orchis × grenieri</h1>
<p>Orchis × grenieri, commonly known as the hybrid green orchid, is a cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, characteristic of many orchid species. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>This hybrid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic makeup.</p>
