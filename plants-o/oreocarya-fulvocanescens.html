<p>Oreocarya fulvocanescens, commonly known as the yellow-bark alpine shrub, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Oreocarya fulvocanescens is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
