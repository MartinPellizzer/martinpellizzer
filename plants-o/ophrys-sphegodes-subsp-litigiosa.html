<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>litigiosa, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect bodies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
