<p>Onoclea augescens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fertile fronds, and its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
