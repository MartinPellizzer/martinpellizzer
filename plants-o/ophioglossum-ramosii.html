                    <h1>Ophioglossum ramosii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum ramosii, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or brownish midrib. The plant produces sporangia on specialized, tongue-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
