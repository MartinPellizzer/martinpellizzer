                    <h1>Orchis × badensis</h1>
<p>Orchis × badensis, commonly known as the Baden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis propinqua.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear numerous showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that demonstrates the genetic diversity within the Orchis genus.</p>
