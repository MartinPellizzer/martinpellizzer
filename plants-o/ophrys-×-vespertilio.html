<p>Ophrys × vespertilio, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys bombycina, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy evolved to attract male bees for pollination. Its floral structure includes a specialized labellum that plays a key role in the mimicry and pollination process.</p>
<p>Ophrys × vespertilio typically grows in open, sunny habitats across Europe, thriving in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
