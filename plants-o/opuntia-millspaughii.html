<p>Opuntia millspaughii, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads, which are covered in a layer of white, waxy hair that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its adaptations, such as reduced leaf surfaces and deep root systems, enable it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia millspaughii plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.</p>
