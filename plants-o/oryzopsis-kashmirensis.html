                    <h1>Oryzopsis kashmirensis</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis kashmirensis, commonly known as Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and alpine pastures.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for biodiversity conservation in its native habitat.</p>
