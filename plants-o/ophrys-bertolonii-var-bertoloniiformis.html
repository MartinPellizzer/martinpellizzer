                    <h1>Ophrys bertolonii var. bertoloniiformis</h1>
<p>Ophrys bertolonii var. bertoloniiformis, commonly known as the Bertoloni's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a form of mimicry used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that are predominantly yellow with dark markings, enhancing its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
