                    <h1>Osmoglossum candidum</h1>
<p>Osmoglossum candidum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Osmoglossum candidum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
