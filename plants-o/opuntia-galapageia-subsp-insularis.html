<p>Opuntia galapageia subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the Galápagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Galápagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are a significant food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in coastal and volcanic soils, adapting to the arid and variable climate of the islands.</p>
<p>Its subspecific status highlights its unique evolutionary adaptations to the isolated environment of the Galápagos.</p>
