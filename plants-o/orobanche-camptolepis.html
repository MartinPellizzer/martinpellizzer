                    <h1>Orobanche camptolepis</h1>
<p>Orobanche camptolepis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes and grasses, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in some ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
