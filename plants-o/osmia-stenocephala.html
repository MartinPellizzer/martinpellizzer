<p>Osmia stenocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed blue bee, is a species of solitary bee native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and distinct blue coloration, which helps in thermoregulation. The plant it pollinates, such as various wildflowers and shrubs, benefits from its efficient pollination behavior. Osmia stenocephala typically nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or wood, and lays its eggs in these spaces.</p>
<p>Its role in pollination contributes to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
