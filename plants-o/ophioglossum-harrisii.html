                    <h1>Ophioglossum harrisii</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum harrisii, commonly known as Harris's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive ferns. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile frond and a separate, spore-bearing fertile frond that is often shorter and more compact. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
