<p>Oeceoclades retzii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Oeceoclades retzii is highly sought after and faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
