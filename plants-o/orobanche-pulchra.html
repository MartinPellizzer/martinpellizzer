                    <h1>Orobanche pulchra</h1>
<p>Orobanche pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants and attaching to them through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
