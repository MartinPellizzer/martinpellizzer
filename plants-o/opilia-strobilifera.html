<p>Opilia strobilifera, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Opilia strobilifera thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
