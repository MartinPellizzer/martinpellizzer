                    <h1>Orontium asarina</h1>
<p>Orontium asarina, commonly known as water arum, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf that floats on the water surface, with a long, narrow petiole that extends below the water. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, purple-tinged spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Orontium asarina thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
