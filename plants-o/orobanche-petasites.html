                    <h1>Orobanche petasites</h1>
<p>Orobanche petasites, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically parasitizes members of the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and dandelions. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
