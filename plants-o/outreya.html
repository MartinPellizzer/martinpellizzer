The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Outreya is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its blooming period typically occurs in spring and early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens in desert climates.</p>
