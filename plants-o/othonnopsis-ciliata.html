                    <h1>Othonnopsis ciliata</h1>
<p>Othonnopsis ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Othonnopsis ciliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
