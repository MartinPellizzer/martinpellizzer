                    <h1>Opuntia littoralis var. vaseyi</h1>
<p>Opuntia littoralis var. vaseyi, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features flattened, paddle-like stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
