<p>Ophrys araneola subsp.</p>
<p>argentaria, commonly known as the silver-haired bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hairy appearance, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
