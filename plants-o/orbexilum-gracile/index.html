                            <h1>Orbexilum Gracile</h1>
<p>Orbexilum gracile is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Despite its modest appearance, the plant plays an important role in supporting local insect life. Due to habitat loss, Orbexilum gracile is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts all the more critical.</p>
