                    <h1>Orobanche canescens var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Orobanche canescens var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or pale green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
