                    <h1>Ophrys zagrica</h1>
<p>Ophrys zagrica, commonly known as the Zagreb bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollinator deception.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys zagrica is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
