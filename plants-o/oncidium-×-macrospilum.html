<p>Oncidium × macrospilum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent plants, Oncidium and Macrospilum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful flowers that can range from yellow to orange and red, with intricate patterns. The plant typically has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>Oncidium × macrospilum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
