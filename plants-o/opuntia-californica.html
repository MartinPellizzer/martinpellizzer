<p>Opuntia californica, commonly known as the California prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or purple fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia californica is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>
