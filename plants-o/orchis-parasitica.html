                    <h1>Orchis parasitica</h1>
<p>Orchis parasitica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a specialized root system that connects it to host plants. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color.</p>
<p>Orchis parasitica is found in specific habitats, such as wet heaths and bogs, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
