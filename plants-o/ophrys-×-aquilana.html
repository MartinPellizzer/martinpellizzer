                    <h1>Ophrys × aquilana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × aquilana, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, yellow and brown flowers that closely resemble female bees, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
