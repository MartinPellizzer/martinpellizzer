<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>migoutiana, commonly known as the dark bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually dark brown to black, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
