                    <h1>Opercularia sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Opercularia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered opercularia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery surface with distinct, rounded lobes and a central areola.</p>
<p>Opercularia sessiliflora is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
