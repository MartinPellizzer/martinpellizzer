                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. anthropophaga</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. anthropophaga, commonly known as the "human-eating rice," is a fictional variant of rice that appears in speculative fiction and mythology.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unusual appearance, often depicted with human-like features or a grotesque form. Botanically, it is imagined to possess traits that deviate from standard rice species, such as altered growth patterns or unique reproductive mechanisms. While not a real plant, its description often incorporates elements of bioluminescence, toxic properties, or symbiotic relationships with humans.</p>
<p>This variant serves as a symbolic or cautionary figure in stories exploring themes of humanity's relationship with nature.</p>
