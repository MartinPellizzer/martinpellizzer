                    <h1>Ophioglossum cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum cuspidatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a long, narrow blade and a specialized, spurred appendage at the base of the leaf. It produces spores in a fleshy, club-shaped structure called a sporangium, which is often covered in a protective layer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
