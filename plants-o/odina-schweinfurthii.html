<p>Odina schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Odina schweinfurthii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
