<p>Oryza sativa subvar. aristata, commonly known as the aristate rice, is a less common subspecies of rice that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender panicles and reduced grain size compared to other rice varieties. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, and it produces a unique type of inflorescence with long, slender branches.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific ecological conditions.</p>
