                    <h1>Orobanche crithmi</h1>
<p>Orobanche crithmi, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and drains nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in certain agricultural settings.</p>
