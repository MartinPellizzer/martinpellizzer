                    <h1>Orobanche denudata</h1>
<p>Orobanche denudata, commonly known as the naked broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stem structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats and can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and nutrient cycling.</p>
