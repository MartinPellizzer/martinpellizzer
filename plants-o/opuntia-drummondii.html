<p>Opuntia drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia drummondii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
