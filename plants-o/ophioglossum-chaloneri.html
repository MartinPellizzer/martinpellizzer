                    <h1>Ophioglossum chaloneri</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum chaloneri, commonly known as the Chaloner's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its primitive, spore-producing reproductive structures. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two asymmetrical lobes. Its spores are produced in specialized sporangia located on the underside of the leaf, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum chaloneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
