                    <h1>Ophryococcus gesnerioides</h1>
<p>Ophryococcus gesnerioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in pine flatwoods. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are showy, with a unique structure that includes a spur-like appendage to accommodate pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
