<p>Opuntia setocarpa, commonly known as the spiny pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp spines and woolly areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and a shallow root system for rapid nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Opuntia setocarpa is also valued for its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses by indigenous communities.</p>
