                    <h1>Ochlopoa × nannfeldtii</h1>
<p>Ochlopoa × nannfeldtii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ochlopoa lutea and Ochlopoa nannfeldtii.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
