<p>Orobanche amethystea, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive purple to reddish stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
