                    <h1>Onixotis viridis</h1>
<p>Onixotis viridis, commonly known as the green onyx orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
