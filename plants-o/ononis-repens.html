<p>Ononis repens, commonly known as creeping plantain, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Ononis repens is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and healing benefits.</p>
