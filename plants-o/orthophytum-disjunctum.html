<p>Orthophytum disjunctum, commonly known as the Disjunctum Sword Fern, is a unique fern species native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
