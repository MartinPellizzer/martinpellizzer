<p>Ophrys tommasinii subsp.</p>
<p>araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a spider, a key adaptation for its specific pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly specialized to attract certain bee species. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
