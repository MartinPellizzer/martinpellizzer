                    <h1>Ophrys anthropophora</h1>
<p>Ophrys anthropophora, commonly known as the human-faced orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a human face, complete with a prominent "nose" and "eyes.". This mimicry is a key feature in its pollination strategy, attracting male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>It is a protected species in several European countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
