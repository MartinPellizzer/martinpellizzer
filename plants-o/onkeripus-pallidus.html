                    <h1>Onkeripus pallidus</h1>
<p>Onkeripus pallidus, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
