<p>Opuntia calmalliana, commonly known as the Calmallian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia calmalliana is well-suited to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert flora.</p>
