<p>Eastern prickly pear, scientifically known as Opuntia galapageia subvar. orientalis, is a striking cactus native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. This species is recognized for its vibrant green pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its spiny appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical uses by indigenous peoples.</p>
