                    <h1>Ornithidium vagans</h1>
<p>Ornithidium vagans, commonly known as the wandering bird's nest, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ornithidium vagans is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
