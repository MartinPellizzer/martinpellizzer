<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent, hairy lip resembling a female bee. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its flowers produce nectar to attract male bees, which in turn facilitate pollination.</p>
<p>This species showcases the remarkable evolutionary adaptations seen in orchids, particularly in their mimicry strategies.</p>
