<p>Oligochaetochilus exallus, commonly known as the golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as peristomes, are intricately designed for spore dispersal.</p>
