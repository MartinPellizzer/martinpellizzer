<p>Onobrychis lanata, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine hairs, and its long, erect stems that produce small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Onobrychis lanata is often used as a cover crop and forage plant due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
