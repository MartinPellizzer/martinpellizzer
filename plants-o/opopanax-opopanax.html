<p>Opopanax opopanax, commonly known as Indian frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped from its bark, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. The leaves are alternate, leathery, and oval in shape, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
