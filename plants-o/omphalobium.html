<p>Omphalobium, commonly known as the "false crown vetch," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their prostrate or ascending growth habit, often forming dense mats. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple in color. Omphalobium species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control.</p>
<p>They are also sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and floral displays.</p>
