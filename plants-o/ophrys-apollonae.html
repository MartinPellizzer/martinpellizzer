                    <h1>Ophrys apollonae</h1>
<p>Ophrys apollonae, commonly known as the Apollo orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys apollonae is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
