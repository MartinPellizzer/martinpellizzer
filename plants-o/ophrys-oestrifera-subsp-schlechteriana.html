<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean climates, often in open woodlands or scrublands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
