                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. gilva</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. gilva, commonly known as the silver rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-hued grains that contrast sharply with the typical white or brown rice varieties. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in specific ecological niches, such as wetlands or shaded areas. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“1.5 meters, with long, narrow leaves and a panicle-shaped inflorescence.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration and growth habits make it a subject of interest for both agricultural research and ornamental cultivation.</p>
