<p>Opuntia haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, specifically Haiti.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia haitiensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
