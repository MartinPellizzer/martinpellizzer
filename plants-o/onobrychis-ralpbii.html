<p>Onobrychis ralpbii, commonly known as Ralpbii burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by spiny, three-lobed seed pods. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
