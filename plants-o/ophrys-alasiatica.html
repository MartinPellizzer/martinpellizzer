<p>Ophrys alasiatica, commonly known as the alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Ophrys alasiatica thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
