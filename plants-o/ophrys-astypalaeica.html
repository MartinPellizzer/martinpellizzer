                    <h1>Ophrys astypalaeica</h1>
<p>Ophrys astypalaeica, commonly known as the Astypalaia bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Astypalaia in the Greek Aegean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys astypalaeica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
