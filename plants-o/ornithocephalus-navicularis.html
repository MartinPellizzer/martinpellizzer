                    <h1>Ornithocephalus navicularis</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus navicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterplantain, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize aquatic soils.</p>
