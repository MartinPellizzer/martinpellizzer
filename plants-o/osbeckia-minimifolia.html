                    <h1>Osbeckia minimifolia</h1>
<p>Osbeckia minimifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow or small-leaved osbeckia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>Osbeckia minimifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and supports local insect populations.</p>
