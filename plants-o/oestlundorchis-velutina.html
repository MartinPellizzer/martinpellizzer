                    <h1>Oestlundorchis velutina</h1>
<p>Oestlundorchis velutina, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and showy, often greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
