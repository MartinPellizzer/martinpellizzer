                    <h1>Ophioglossum timorense</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum timorense, commonly known as the Timor adder's mouth, is a rare fern species native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes primitive ferns characterized by their unique morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnately compound leaf that is often divided into narrow segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaf blades.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum timorense is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research.</p>
