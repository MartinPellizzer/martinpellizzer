<p>Opuntia agglomerata, commonly known as the clustered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia agglomerata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
