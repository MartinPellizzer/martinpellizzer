                    <h1>Obesia arida</h1>
<p>Obesia arida, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Obesia arida is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions through its succulent structure and deep root system.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
