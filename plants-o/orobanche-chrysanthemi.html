                    <h1>Orobanche chrysanthemi</h1>
<p>Orobanche chrysanthemi, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-brown stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
