<p>Ophrys aestivalis, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees.</p>
<p>Ophrys aestivalis is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
