                    <h1>Ornithogalum squamosum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum squamosum, commonly known as the silver leaf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
