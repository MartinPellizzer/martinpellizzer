                    <h1>Orphium</h1>
<p>Orphium, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a greenish or yellowish hue. Orphium species are usually perennial herbs with rhizomatous growth, and they produce showy, orchid-like blooms.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
