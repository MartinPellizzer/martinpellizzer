                    <h1>Ophrys holosericea subsp. pollinensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollinens Ophrys, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. This species is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow corolla and a prominent, hairy lip that plays a crucial role in attracting male bees for pseudocopulation. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, often in open habitats with limited vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
