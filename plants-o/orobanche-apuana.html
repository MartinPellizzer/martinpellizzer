<p>Orobanche apuana, commonly known as the Apuan broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Apuan Alps in Tuscany, Italy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as certain species of Astragalus and Cytisus.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Orobanche apuana is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
