                    <h1>Ophioglossum nudicaule var. tenerum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum nudicaule var. tenerum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, primitive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick rhizome with a single, broad, leathery leaf that is often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
