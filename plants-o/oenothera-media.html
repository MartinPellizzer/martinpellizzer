<p>Oenothera media, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Oenothera media thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its medicinal properties due to the high content of essential fatty acids in its seeds.</p>
