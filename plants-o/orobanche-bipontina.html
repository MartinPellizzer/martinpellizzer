                    <h1>Orobanche bipontina</h1>
<p>Orobanche bipontina, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it a seasonal rather than annual species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops such as mustard and cabbages.</p>
