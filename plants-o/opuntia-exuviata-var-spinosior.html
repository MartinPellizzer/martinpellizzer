<p>Opuntia exuviata var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by fruit that turns red when mature. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and distinctive appearance.</p>
