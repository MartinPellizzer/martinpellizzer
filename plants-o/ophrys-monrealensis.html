                    <h1>Ophrys monrealensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys monrealensis, commonly known as the Monreal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the female of a specific bee species, a trait known as mimicry. This mimicry plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys monrealensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
