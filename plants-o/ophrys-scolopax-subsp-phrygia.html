<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, during which it produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish-green flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
