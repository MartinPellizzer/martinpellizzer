                    <h1>Opuntia nitens</h1>
<p>Opuntia nitens, commonly known as the silver prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in white, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia nitens is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in hot, dry climates.</p>
