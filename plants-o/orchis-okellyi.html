<p>Orchis okellyi, commonly known as the Okelly's orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family found primarily in specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers have a complex structure with three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into showy lip petals.</p>
<p>Orchis okellyi is notable for its ecological significance and is often protected due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
