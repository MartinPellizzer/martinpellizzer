                    <h1>Orchis ericetorum</h1>
<p>Orchis ericetorum, commonly known as the heath orchid, is a species of orchid native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, heathland environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. Orchis ericetorum is a perennial herb that blooms from June to August, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and habitat specificity.</p>
