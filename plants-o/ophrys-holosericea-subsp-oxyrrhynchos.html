<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its specialized pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers, each with a distinctive, hood-like labellum.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its morphological variation and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its growth and reproduction.</p>
