                    <h1>Ortgiesia organensis</h1>
<p>Ortgiesia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the Organ Mountains in New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Ortgiesia organensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>
