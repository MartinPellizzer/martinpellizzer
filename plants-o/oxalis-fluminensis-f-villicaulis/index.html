<p>Coral bells, scientifically known as Oxalis fluminensis f. villicaulis, are a striking ornamental plant prized for their delicate, bell-shaped flowers and lush green foliage. Native to South Africa, this unique cultivar thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes. Its foliage resembles coral in appearance, with intricate patterns and a soft, velvety texture that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. While it is relatively low maintenance, it requires consistent moisture and protection from extreme temperatures to flourish. This plant not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of gardens but also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to a thriving ecosystem.</p>
