                    <h1>Orobanche echinopophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche echinopophya, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions.</p>
