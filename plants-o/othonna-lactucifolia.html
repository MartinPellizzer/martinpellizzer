                    <h1>Othonna lactucifolia</h1>
<p>Othonna lactucifolia, commonly known as the milkweed othonna, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Othonna lactucifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
