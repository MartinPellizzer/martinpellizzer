<p>Ophrys palaestinae, commonly known as the Palestine bee orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Levant region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect bodies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
