<p>Oreorchis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and lack a distinct scent, relying on passive pollination.</p>
<p>Oreorchis micrantha is a non-photosynthetic plant, deriving its nutrients from a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
