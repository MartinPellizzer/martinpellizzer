<p>Orobanche condensata subsp.</p>
<p>spartii, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments by forming specialized haustoria to attach to host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
