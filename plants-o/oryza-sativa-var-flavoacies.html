                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. flavoacies</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. flavoacies, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a type of rice that has been genetically modified to produce beta-carotene, which gives it a yellowish color.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its nutritional content, as it aims to address vitamin A deficiency in regions where rice is a staple food. The plant has typical grass-like features, with long, narrow leaves and panicles that bear small, white flowers. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a culm that supports the grain-bearing panicles.</p>
<p>The grains themselves are smaller and more elongated compared to standard rice varieties, contributing to its unique appearance and nutritional profile.</p>
