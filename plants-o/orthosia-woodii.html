<p>Orthosia woodii, commonly known as the woodii's orthosia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora and ecological adaptation.</p>
