                    <h1>Ophrys ariadnae</h1>
<p>Ophrys ariadnae, commonly known as the Ariadne's Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the appearance of female wasps, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, often in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the wasp's body and wings.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys ariadnae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
