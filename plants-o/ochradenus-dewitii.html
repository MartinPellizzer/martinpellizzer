                    <h1>Ochradenus dewitii</h1>
<p>Ochradenus dewitii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a hardy shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ochradenus dewitii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
