                    <h1>Orobanche rumseyana</h1>
<p>Orobanche rumseyana, commonly known as the Rumsey's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, after which it attaches to the roots of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
