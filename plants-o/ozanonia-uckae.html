                    <h1>Ozanonia uckae</h1>
<p>Ozanonia uckae, commonly known as the Uckean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Ozanonia uckae is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and host-specific interactions.</p>
