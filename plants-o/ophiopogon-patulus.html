<p>Ophiopogon patulus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.
