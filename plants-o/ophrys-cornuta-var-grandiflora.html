                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
