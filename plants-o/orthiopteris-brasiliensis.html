                    <h1>Orthiopteris brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Orthiopteris brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi-lobed and have a smooth, waxy surface, which aids in its buoyancy and survival in aquatic environments.</p>
