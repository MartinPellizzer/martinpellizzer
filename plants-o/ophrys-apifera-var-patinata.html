<p>Ophrys apifera var. patinata, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female honeybee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
