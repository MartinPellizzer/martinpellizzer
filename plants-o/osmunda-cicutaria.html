<p>Osmunda cicutaria, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into smaller, branching segments. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Osmunda cicutaria is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of water quality and ecological health in wetland ecosystems.</p>
