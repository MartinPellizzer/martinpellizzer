<p>Onagra ornata, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, ribbed stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils. Onagra ornata is adapted to thrive in full sun and has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
