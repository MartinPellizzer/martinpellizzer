<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>toroslaria, commonly known as the Hungarian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a yellow and brownish-green pouch with intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
