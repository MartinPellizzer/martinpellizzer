                    <h1>Opuntia microdasys var. minor</h1>
<p>Opuntia microdasys var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
