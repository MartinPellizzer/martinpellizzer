                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera f. peralba</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera f. peralba, commonly known as the white bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a pale yellow to white coloration, often with a distinctive black or dark brown pattern. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
