                    <h1>Opuntia echios var. zacana</h1>
<p>Opuntia echios var. zacana, commonly known as the Zacate Grande prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Opuntia genus. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its ornamental value and adaptability to semi-desert conditions.</p>
