                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. flaviseta</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. flaviseta, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a type of rice characterized by its unique yellow grain color due to the presence of carotenoids.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is cultivated for its nutritional value, particularly its high content of beta-carotene. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stems and broad, flat leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and abundant sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety has been developed to address vitamin A deficiency in populations that rely heavily on rice as a staple food.</p>
