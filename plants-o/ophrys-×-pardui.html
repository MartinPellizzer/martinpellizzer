                    <h1>Ophrys × pardui</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pardui, commonly known as the Pallid Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys fucata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats across Europe, particularly in grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Ophrys × pardui is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations.</p>
