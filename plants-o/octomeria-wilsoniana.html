<p>Octomeria wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's octomeria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, woolly fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
