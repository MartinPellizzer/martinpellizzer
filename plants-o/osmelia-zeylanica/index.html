                            <h1>Osmelia Zeylanica</h1>
<p>Ceylon osmunda, scientifically known as Osmelia zeylanica, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. This plant is often referred to as the "Holy Fern" due to its historical and cultural significance in local traditions. With its delicate fronds and prehistoric appearance, it has captivated botanists and nature enthusiasts for centuries. Found primarily in moist, shaded environments, it plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance. Despite its beauty, Ceylon osmunda faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
