                    <h1>Orobanche comosula</h1>
<p>Orobanche comosula, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized haustoria for attachment to host roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, and it is often found in disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants, including agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a significant concern for ecosystem and agricultural management.</p>
