                    <h1>Osmunda palustris</h1>
<p>Osmunda palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, upright frond structure with a central stem and a fan-shaped crown of leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. Osmunda palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
