                    <h1>Obeliscaria</h1>
<p>Obeliscaria, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize rocky areas make it an important component of alpine and arid ecosystems.</p>
<p>Obeliscaria is often found in regions with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils.</p>
