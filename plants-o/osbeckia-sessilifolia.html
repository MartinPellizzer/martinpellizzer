                    <h1>Osbeckia sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Osbeckia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy and sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Osbeckia sessilifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil.</p>
