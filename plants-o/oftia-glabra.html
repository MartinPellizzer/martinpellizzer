                    <h1>Oftia glabra</h1>
<p>Oftia glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, smooth-textured leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Oftia glabra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
