<p>Ophrys eleonorae subsp.</p>
<p>limensis, commonly known as the Limens orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
