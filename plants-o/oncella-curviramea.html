                    <h1>Oncella curviramea</h1>
<p>Oncella curviramea, commonly known as the curly-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has thin, branching stems that often curl, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Oncella curviramea thrives in still or slow-moving water, where it can efficiently capture and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
