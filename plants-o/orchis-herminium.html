                    <h1>Orchis herminium</h1>
<p>Orchis herminium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to brownish stems and its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a unique ability to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
