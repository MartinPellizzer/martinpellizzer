                    <h1>Opuntia xanthostemma</h1>
<p>Opuntia xanthostemma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia xanthostemma is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples.</p>
