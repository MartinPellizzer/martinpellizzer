                    <h1>Ophioglossum convexum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum convexum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred spores and a distinctive, elongated leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is positioned on the underside of the leaf.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum convexum is of particular interest to botanists due to its primitive features and limited distribution.</p>
