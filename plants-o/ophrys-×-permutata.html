                    <h1>Ophrys × permutata</h1>
<p>Ophrys × permutata, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid, resulting in a blend of characteristics from both parents. The plant produces intricate, bee-like flowers that are designed to mimic female bees, a trait known as sexual deception. These flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>Ophrys × permutata is found in various parts of Europe, often in moist, calcareous soils, and is a prime example of orchid hybridization in the wild.</p>
