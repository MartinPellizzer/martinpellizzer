                    <h1>Ophrys insectifera subvar. arachnitiformis</h1>
<p>Ophrys insectifera subvar. arachnitiformis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a spider, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, intricate flower with a dark, hairy labellum that resembles a spider's body. It thrives in rocky, sunny habitats and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in its native range.</p>
