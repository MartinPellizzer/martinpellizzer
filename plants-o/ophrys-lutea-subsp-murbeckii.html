<p>Ophrys lutea subsp.</p>
<p>murbeckii, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers have a specialized structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
