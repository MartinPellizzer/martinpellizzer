                    <h1>Ophrys × baldensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × baldensis, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive fuzzy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Ophrys × baldensis is a testament to the evolutionary adaptations of orchids in mimicking pollinators for reproductive success.</p>
