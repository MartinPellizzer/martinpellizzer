<p>Osmunda hybrida, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a robust fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, which are composed of numerous small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Osmunda hybrida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
