                    <h1>Oreochloa pedemontana</h1>
<p>Oreochloa pedemontana, commonly known as the mountain grass or Pedemontana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and mountainous environments, often found in the Andes and other highland areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
