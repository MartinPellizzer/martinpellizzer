                    <h1>Orobanche iammonensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche iammonensis, commonly known as the bladderflower, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts such as vetch or clover. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals released by the host plant's roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host species.</p>
