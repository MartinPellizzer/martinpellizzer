                    <h1>Orobanche flava</h1>
<p>Orobanche flava, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
