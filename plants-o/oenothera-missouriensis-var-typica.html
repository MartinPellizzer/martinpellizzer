<p>Oenothera missouriensis var. typica, commonly known as the Missouri evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a distinctive taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are generally hairy and branching.</p>
<p>The Missouri evening primrose is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
