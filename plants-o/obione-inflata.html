<p>Obione inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes elongated stems with specialized bladders that aid in nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Obione inflata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both its structure and the microorganisms it hosts.</p>
