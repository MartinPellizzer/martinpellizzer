                    <h1>Orobanche spectabilis</h1>
<p>Orobanche spectabilis, commonly known as the showy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the United States, particularly in the western states. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which help attract pollinators. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as those in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
