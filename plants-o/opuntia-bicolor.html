<p>Opuntia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a distinct white or pale pink stripe running along the length of each segment. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia bicolor is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having spines that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
