<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>sintenisii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
