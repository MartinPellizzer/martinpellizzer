                    <h1>Orobanche schelkovnikovii</h1>
<p>Orobanche schelkovnikovii, commonly known as the Schelkovnikov's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stem structure. This species typically parasitizes various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in a spikelike arrangement, and are typically pink or white in color.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
