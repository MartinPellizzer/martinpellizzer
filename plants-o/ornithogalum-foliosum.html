<p>Ornithogalum foliosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
