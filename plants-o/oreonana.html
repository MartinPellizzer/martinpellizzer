                    <h1>Oreonana</h1>
<p>Oreonana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear only after rainfall. Oreonana species are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. They produce small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red, often resembling the shape of a ghost or a face.</p>
<p>Due to their extreme habitat requirements, many Oreonana species are rare and face conservation challenges.</p>
