                            <h1>Orobanche Cernua Var. Bicolor</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua var. bicolor is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and is often associated with leguminous species. This variant is distinguished by its unique two-colored flowers, which range from white to pink. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays an important role in certain ecosystems. However, its presence can also impact the health of its host plants.</p>
