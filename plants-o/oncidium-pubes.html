<p>Oncidium pubes, commonly known as the fuzzy orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or orange markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its roots are often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps in absorbing nutrients and moisture.</p>
<p>Oncidium pubes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
