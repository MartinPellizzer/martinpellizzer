<p>Opuntia crispicrinita, commonly known as the "Crisp-haired Prickly Pear," is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in clusters of small, hair-like spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick cuticles and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Opuntia crispicrinita is also notable for its role in traditional indigenous cultures and as a source of food and medicine.</p>
