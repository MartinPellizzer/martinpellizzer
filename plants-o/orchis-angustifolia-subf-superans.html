<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>superans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow or greenish flower spike.</p>
<p>The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients, lacking chlorophyll. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
