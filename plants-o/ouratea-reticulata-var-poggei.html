<p>Ouratea reticulata var. poggei, commonly known as the Bog Bean, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
