                    <h1>Ortholobium</h1>
<p>Ortholobium, commonly known as the slender burr legume, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Ortholobium species are characterized by their compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, hard seeds. They often grow in dry, disturbed soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological roles and potential for use in land restoration.</p>
