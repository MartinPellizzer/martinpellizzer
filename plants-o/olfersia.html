                    <h1>Olfersia</h1>
<p>Olfersia, commonly known as the "wild vanilla" or "false vanilla," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers. Olfersia species typically have thin, vine-like stems and produce small, greenish-white or yellowish flowers that emit a sweet scent. The fruits are elongated pods containing numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Although not widely cultivated for commercial use like true vanilla, some species are appreciated for their ornamental value and unique fragrance.</p>
