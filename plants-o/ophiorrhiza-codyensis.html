<p>Ophiorrhiza codyensis, commonly known as the Cody's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as dipterocarps, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. Its small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza codyensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
