<p>Odontoglossum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Odontoglossum cordatum prefers cool, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
