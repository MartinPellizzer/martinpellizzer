<p>It is a perennial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome that supports its upright stems. The plant produces showy, lip-like flowers that are often mistaken for female wasps, a mimicry strategy used to attract male wasps for pollination. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Ophrys amanensis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
