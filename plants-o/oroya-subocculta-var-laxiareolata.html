<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
