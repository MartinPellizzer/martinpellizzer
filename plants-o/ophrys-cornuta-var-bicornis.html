                    <h1>Ophrys cornuta var. bicornis</h1>
<p>Ophrys cornuta var. bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees through a process called sexual deception. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with distinctive dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
