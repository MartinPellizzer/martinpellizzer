                    <h1>Orobanche loricata var. picridis</h1>
<p>Orobanche loricata var. picridis, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often found in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
