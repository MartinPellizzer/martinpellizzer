                    <h1>Oxystigma</h1>
<p>Oxystigma, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its unique, deeply fissured bark that resembles the pattern of a sandal. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries in age. Its wood is highly prized for its rich reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, Oxystigma is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
