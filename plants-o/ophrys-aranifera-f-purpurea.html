<p>Ophrys aranifera f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species characterized by its intricate floral structure.</p>
<p>The plant features a single, erect stem that produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The flower is typically purple or deep violet in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
