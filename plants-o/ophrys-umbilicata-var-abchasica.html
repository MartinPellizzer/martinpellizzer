                    <h1>Ophrys umbilicata var. abchasica</h1>
<p>Ophrys umbilicata var. abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
