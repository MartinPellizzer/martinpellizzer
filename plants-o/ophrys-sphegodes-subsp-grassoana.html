<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>grassoana, commonly known as the grassland bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny grasslands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
