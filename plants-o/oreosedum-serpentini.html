                    <h1>Oreosedum serpentini</h1>
<p>Oreosedum serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing efficient water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreosedum serpentini thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
