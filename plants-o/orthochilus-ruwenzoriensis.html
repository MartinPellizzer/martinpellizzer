<p>Orthochilus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
