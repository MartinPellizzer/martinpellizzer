                    <h1>Oplismenus compositus var. owatarii</h1>
<p>Oplismenus compositus var. owatarii, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silvery-white midrib running down the center of each leaf. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage rather than its flowers, and it is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
