                    <h1>Ophrys fuciflora var. carmeloides</h1>
<p>Ophrys fuciflora var. carmeloides, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled green and brown leaves that resemble bark, providing it with camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a complex structure that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
