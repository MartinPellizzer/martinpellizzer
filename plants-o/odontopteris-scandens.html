<p>Odontopteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along surfaces. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching shape that gives the plant a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
