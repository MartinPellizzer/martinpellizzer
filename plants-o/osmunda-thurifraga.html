                    <h1>Osmunda thurifraga</h1>
<p>Osmunda thurifraga, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, ornate fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively through underground growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on specialized structures called sori.</p>
