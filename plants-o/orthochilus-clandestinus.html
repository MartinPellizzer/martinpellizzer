                    <h1>Orthochilus clandestinus</h1>
<p>Orthochilus clandestinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
