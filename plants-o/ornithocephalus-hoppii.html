                    <h1>Ornithocephalus hoppii</h1>
<p>Ornithocephalus hoppii, commonly known as the Hoppi's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble tiny ghostly figures, giving it its common name. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithocephalus hoppii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
