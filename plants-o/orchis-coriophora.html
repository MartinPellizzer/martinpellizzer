<p>Orchis coriophora, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear two opposite leaves near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Orchis coriophora is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized roots.</p>
