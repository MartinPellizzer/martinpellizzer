The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and they bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Oriastrum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
