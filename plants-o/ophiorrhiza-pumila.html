<p>Ophiorrhiza pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove or small mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers and subsequently small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It is often found in mangrove ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza pumila is a key species in the ecological dynamics of coastal zones.</p>
