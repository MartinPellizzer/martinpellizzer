<p>Oxypetalum scalae, commonly known as the mountain oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, adapting to the high-altitude environment where it thrives. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
