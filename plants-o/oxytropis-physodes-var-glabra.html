                    <h1>Oxytropis physodes var. glabra</h1>
<p>Oxytropis physodes var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The smooth, hairless leaves and overall compact growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Fabaceae family.</p>
