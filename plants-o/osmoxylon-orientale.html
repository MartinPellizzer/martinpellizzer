                    <h1>Osmoxylon orientale</h1>
<p>Osmoxylon orientale, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Osmoxylon orientale is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
