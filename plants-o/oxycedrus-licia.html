                    <h1>Oxycedrus licia</h1>
<p>Oxycedrus licia, commonly known as the Licia cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by narrow, woody cones. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its wood is prized for its aromatic properties and durability, making it historically significant in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
