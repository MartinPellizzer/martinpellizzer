<p>Oncidium cardiostigma, commonly known as the heart-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to silver pubescence. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers with bright yellow petals and a deep red lip, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Oncidium cardiostigma is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
