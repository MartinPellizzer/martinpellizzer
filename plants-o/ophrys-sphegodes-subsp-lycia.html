<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>lycia, commonly known as the Lycian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like appearance, complete with a pseudostigma and a labellum that mimics the body of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
