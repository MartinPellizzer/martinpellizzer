<p>Oriastrum polymallum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Oriastrum polymallum is well adapted to harsh desert climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
