<p>Ottelia kunenensis, commonly known as the African water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, often with its roots submerged and leaves floating on the surface. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ottelia kunenensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
