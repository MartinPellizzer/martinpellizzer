                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. sordida</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its shorter, more compact grain compared to other rice varieties, and it often has a darker, more muted coloration. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and has a shorter growth cycle, making it suitable for certain agricultural conditions. Its leaves are usually narrower and more upright, contributing to its distinct appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its limited commercial use, it remains of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for adaptation to specific climates.</p>
