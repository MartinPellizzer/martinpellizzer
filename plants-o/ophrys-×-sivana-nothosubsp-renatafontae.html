<p>Ophrys × sivana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>renatafontae, commonly known as the Renata fontana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a female wasp, a trait evolved for effective pollination. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in forested and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys sivana and other related species, showcasing genetic diversity within the Ophrys genus.</p>
