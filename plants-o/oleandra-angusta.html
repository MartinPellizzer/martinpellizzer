                    <h1>Oleandra angusta</h1>
<p>Oleandra angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf oleander, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces showy clusters of pink, red, or white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Oleandra angusta is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested.</p>
