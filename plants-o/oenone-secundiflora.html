                    <h1>Oenone secundiflora</h1>
<p>Oenone secundiflora, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oenone secundiflora produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
