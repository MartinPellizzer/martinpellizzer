                    <h1>Ophioglossum oleosum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum oleosum, commonly known as the Indian ladder or oil plant, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often segmented leaves that resemble a ladder, hence its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum oleosum is notable for its slow growth and is often considered a living fossil due to its primitive morphology and evolutionary history.</p>
