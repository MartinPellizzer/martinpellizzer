                    <h1>Ophrys × kattaviensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × kattaviensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic the appearance of female bees or wasps, a trait known as sexual deception. This mimicry is used to attract male pollinators, which in turn transfer pollen between flowers.</p>
<p>The hybrid is typically found in Mediterranean regions, growing in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils.</p>
