<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>hebes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in nutrient-poor soils. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, bee-like shape.</p>
<p>The subspecies hebes is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more elongated floral structure compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes.</p>
