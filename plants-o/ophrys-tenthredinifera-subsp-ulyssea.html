<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>ulyssea, commonly known as the Ulysses bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble the body of a bee, particularly the wasp *Ulysses* species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
