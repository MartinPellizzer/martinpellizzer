                    <h1>Orthogramma</h1>
<p>Orthogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, perennial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Orthogramma species are characterized by their compact, often tufted growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to their unique habitat preferences and intricate morphology, Orthogramma species are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
