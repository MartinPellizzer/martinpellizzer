                    <h1>Orobanche galiophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche galiophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation.</p>
