                    <h1>Orobanche mupinensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche mupinensis, commonly known as the Mupin broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root contact with host plants for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in association with specific host species such as those in the genus *Crotalaria*. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to study in natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
