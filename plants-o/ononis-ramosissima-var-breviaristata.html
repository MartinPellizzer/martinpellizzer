The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
