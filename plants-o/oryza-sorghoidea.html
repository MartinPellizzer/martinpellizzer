                <h1>Oryza sorghoidea</h1>
<p>Oryza sorghoidea, commonly known as the slender ricegrass, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are typically encased in a thin hull, similar to other members of the Oryza genus.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as rice, it is sometimes grown as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes.</p>
