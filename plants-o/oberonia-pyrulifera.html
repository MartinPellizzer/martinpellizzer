<p>Oberonia pyrulifera, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in lowland to mid-elevation forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Oberonia pyrulifera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
