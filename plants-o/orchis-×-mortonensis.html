<p>Orchis × mortonensis, commonly known as the Morton's orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morrowii and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist woodland habitats. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Its roots system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological significance in its native range.</p>
