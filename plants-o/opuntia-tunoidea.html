                    <h1>Opuntia tunoidea</h1>
<p>Opuntia tunoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia tunoidea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
