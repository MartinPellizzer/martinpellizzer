<p>Ophrys exaltata subsp.</p>
<p>sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
