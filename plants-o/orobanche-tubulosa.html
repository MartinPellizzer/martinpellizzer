                    <h1>Orobanche tubulosa</h1>
<p>Orobanche tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, with seeds remaining viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
