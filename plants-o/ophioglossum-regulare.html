                    <h1>Ophioglossum regulare</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum regulare, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient fern species with a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a single, upright, sword-shaped leaf that is often divided into two parts, resembling a tongue. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaf, which are arranged in a linear pattern along the midrib. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum regulare is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
