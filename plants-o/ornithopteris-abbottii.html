                    <h1>Ornithopteris abbottii</h1>
<p>Ornithopteris abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ornithopteris abbottii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
