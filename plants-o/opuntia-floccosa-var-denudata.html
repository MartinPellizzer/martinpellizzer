                    <h1>Opuntia floccosa var. denudata</h1>
<p>Opuntia floccosa var. denudata, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its lack of the dense, fuzzy covering found on other Opuntia species, giving it its common name.</p>
