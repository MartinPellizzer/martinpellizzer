                    <h1>Orchis italica f. breviloba</h1>
<p>Orchis italica f. breviloba, commonly known as the Italian twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and a single, pale yellow or greenish flower that lacks petals. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
