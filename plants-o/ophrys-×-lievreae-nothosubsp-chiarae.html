<p>Ophrys × lievreae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>chiarae, commonly known as the Chiara orchid, is a hybrid species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, including a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, facilitating its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in Mediterranean climates, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown hues, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its role in studying hybridization and evolutionary adaptations in orchids.</p>
