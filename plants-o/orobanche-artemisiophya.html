                    <h1>Orobanche artemisiophya</h1>
<p>Orobanche artemisiophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the sunflower family. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests crops.</p>
