<p>Ophrys incubacea subsp.</p>
<p>castri-caesaris, commonly known as Caesar's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its complex, bee-mimicking flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that resembles a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
