<p>Opilia campestris var. strobilifera, commonly known as the clustered opilia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, cone-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal flowering.</p>
