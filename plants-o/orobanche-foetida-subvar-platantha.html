                    <h1>Orobanche foetida subvar. platantha</h1>
<p>Orobanche foetida subvar. platantha, commonly known as the stinking broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as vetch and clover. Its distinctive odor, which resembles that of rotting meat, is thought to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
