                    <h1>Oreophilus macroticus</h1>
<p>Oreophilus macroticus, commonly known as the giant mountain orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Oreophilus macroticus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
