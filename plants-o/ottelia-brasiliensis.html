<p>Ottelia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually submerged. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Ottelia brasiliensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
