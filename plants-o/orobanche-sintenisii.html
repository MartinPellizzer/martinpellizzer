<p>Orobanche sintenisii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
