<p>Oliganthes oxylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cholla, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Oliganthes oxylepis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and distinctive species within its native habitat.</p>
