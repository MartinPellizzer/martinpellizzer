                    <h1>Oxymitra welwitschii</h1>
<p>Oxymitra welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's oxymitra, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky appearance with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
