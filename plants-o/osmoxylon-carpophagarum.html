                    <h1>Osmoxylon carpophagarum</h1>
<p>Osmoxylon carpophagarum, commonly known as the black wood-rot fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily decomposes dead wood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, woody structure and the ability to break down lignin, a complex component of plant cell walls. This fungus is typically found in moist, temperate forests where it colonizes fallen trees and stumps. Its fruiting bodies are small and often hidden beneath the bark, making them difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Osmoxylon carpophagarum plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by facilitating the decomposition of organic matter.</p>
