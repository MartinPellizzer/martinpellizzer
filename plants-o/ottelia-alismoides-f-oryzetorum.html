<p>Ottelia alismoides f. oryzetorum, commonly known as the rice-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that resemble rice blades.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the muddy substrates where it thrives.</p>
<p>Ottelia alismoides f. oryzetorum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
