                    <h1>Octella microphyla</h1>
<p>Octella microphyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
