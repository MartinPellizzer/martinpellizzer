                    <h1>Ophrys spruneri</h1>
<p>Ophrys spruneri, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish with intricate patterns that aid in its pollination mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys spruneri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
