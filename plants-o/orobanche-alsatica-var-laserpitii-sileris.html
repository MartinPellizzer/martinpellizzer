                    <h1>Orobanche alsatica var. laserpitii-sileris</h1>
<p>Orobanche alsatica var. laserpitii-sileris, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants such as legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological studies of plant interactions.</p>
