<p>Onobrychis saravschanica, commonly known as the Saratov burclover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range.</p>
