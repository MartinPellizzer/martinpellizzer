<p>Oryza rubribarbis, commonly known as the red-barbed ricegrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of its florets. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a dense, tufted cluster at the base.</p>
<p>Oryza rubribarbis is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in wetland ecosystems.</p>
