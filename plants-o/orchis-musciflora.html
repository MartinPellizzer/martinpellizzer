                    <h1>Orchis musciflora</h1>
<p>Orchis musciflora, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, showy flower with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The orchid's relationship with mycorrhizal fungi is essential for its growth, as it relies on these fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
