                    <h1>Ophioglossum rubellum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum rubellum, commonly known as the red harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like, reddish-brown fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sporangium, which produces spores for propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
