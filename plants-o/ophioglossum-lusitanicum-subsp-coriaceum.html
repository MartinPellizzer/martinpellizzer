<p>Ophioglossum lusitanicum subsp.</p>
<p>coriaceum, commonly known as the Portuguese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spores and a single, broad, leathery leaf that resembles a tongue.</p>
<p>The plant produces a short, erect spore-bearing stem with a distinctive, hooded structure at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
