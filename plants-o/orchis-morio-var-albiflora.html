                    <h1>Orchis morio var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Orchis morio var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. This variety typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in calcareous soils. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, usually with 4â€“8 blooms, and is known for its ephemeral blooming period in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
