<p>Oldenlandia hirsuta var. glabricalycina, commonly known as the silky oldenlandia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central column. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which set it apart from the typical hairy form of the species.</p>
