                    <h1>Opuntia lanigera</h1>
<p>Opuntia lanigera, commonly known as the wooly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, woolly white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils.</p>
<p>Opuntia lanigera is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruit.</p>
