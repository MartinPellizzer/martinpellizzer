<p>Opercularia stuartiana, commonly known as the Stuart's opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically bright green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
