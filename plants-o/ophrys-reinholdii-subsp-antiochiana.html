<p>Ophrys reinholdii subsp.</p>
<p>antiochiana, commonly known as the Antioch bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as chaparral and serpentine barrens. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
