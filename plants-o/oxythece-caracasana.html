<p>Oxythece caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasana orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support for the inflorescence.</p>
<p>Oxythece caracasana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
