<p>Opilia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has woody stems and evergreen leaves that are broadly ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Opilia obovata plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the nutrient cycling in its host trees.</p>
