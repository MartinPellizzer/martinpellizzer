<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Its leaves are hairy, giving it the subspecific name *villosa*, and it produces showy, yellow-brown flowers with a distinctive bee-like shape.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
