                    <h1>Ophrys × licana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × licana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Ophrys genus in the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is notable for its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic female bees to attract male pollinators. Its botanical features include a slender stem with a single spike of flowers, each resembling a bee in color and shape.</p>
<p>This mimicry is a key adaptation for its unique pollination strategy, making it a subject of interest in both botany and evolutionary biology.</p>
