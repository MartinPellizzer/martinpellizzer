                    <h1>Oxypetalum charrua</h1>
<p>Oxypetalum charrua, commonly known as the Charrua orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species.</p>
<p>Oxypetalum charrua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
