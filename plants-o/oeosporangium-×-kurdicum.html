                    <h1>Oeosporangium × kurdicum</h1>
<p>Oeosporangium × kurdicum, commonly known as the hybrid lichen, is a unique combination of two lichen species, Oeosporangium and Kurdicum.</p>
<p>It exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. The thallus, or body, of this lichen is usually crust-like, adhering tightly to the substrate. It thrives in humid environments, often found on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Oeosporangium × kurdicum contributes to its adaptability and ecological significance in diverse habitats.</p>
