<p>Orophea tarrosae, commonly known as the Madagascan star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Randiaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single trunk and large, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Orophea tarrosae is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
