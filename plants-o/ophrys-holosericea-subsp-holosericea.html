<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>holosericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a single, erect flowering stem.</p>
<p>The flowers are specialized for mimicry, resembling female bees to attract male pollinators. The orchid has a complex life cycle, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
