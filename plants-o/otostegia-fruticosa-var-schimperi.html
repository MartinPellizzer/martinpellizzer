                    <h1>Otostegia fruticosa var. schimperi</h1>
<p>Otostegia fruticosa var. schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian spurge, is a shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
