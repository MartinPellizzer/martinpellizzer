<p>Oncidium anceps, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, spicy scent. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Oncidium anceps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
