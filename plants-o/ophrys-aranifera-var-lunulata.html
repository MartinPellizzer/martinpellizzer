                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. lunulata</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. lunulata, commonly known as the Moon-veined Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pale yellow and brown coloration, often with a white or pale blue marking near the base. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
