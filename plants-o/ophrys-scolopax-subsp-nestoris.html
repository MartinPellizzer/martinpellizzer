<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>nestoris, commonly known as the Nestor's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow face with intricate patterns resembling a bee's head.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its pollination strategy relies on a sophisticated mimicry of female bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
