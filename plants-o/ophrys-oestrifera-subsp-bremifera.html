<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a labellum.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
