<p>Oreogrammitis nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and lack true roots, instead relying on its leaves for nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spore-producing capsules forming on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis nuda is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in specialized terrariums or greenhouses.</p>
