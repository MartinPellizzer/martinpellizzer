                    <h1>Ossaea caudata</h1>
<p>Ossaea caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated thallus structure.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the majority of its nutrients through photosynthesis. Ossaea caudata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
