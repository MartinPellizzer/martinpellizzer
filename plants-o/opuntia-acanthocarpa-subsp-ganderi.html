<p>Opuntia acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>ganderi, commonly known as the Gander's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations to harsh environments include succulent stems for water storage and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
