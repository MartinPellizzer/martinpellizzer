                    <h1>Oberonia volucris</h1>
<p>Oberonia volucris, commonly known as the flying orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and it has elongated, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
