                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. calendulae</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. calendulae, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on the roots of other plants such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its seed pods contain numerous tiny seeds. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is characterized by a short, fleshy stem and reduced leaves, with the majority of its energy devoted to flowering and seed production.</p>
