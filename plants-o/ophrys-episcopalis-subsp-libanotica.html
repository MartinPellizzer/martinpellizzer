<p>Ophrys episcopalis subsp.</p>
<p>libanotica, commonly known as the Libanotica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that aids in pollination by mimicking the visual cues of female bees.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, hairy labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
