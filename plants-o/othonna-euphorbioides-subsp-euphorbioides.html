<p>Othonna euphorbioides subsp.</p>
<p>euphorbioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a basal rosette, which help it store water and withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically in spring. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
