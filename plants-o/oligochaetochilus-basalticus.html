                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus basalticus</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus basalticus, commonly known as the basalt moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils found in volcanic or basaltic regions. This plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting microbial life in its unique habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an indicator species for specific geological and ecological conditions.</p>
