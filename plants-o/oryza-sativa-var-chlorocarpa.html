                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. chlorocarpa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-seeded rice, is a variant of the rice species characterized by its unique green seed color.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender leaves and panicles that bear small, rice grains. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>The green-seeded rice is notable for its distinct pigmentation, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll in the seed coat.</p>
