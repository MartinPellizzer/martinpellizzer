<p>Orbea woodii, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, Orbea woodii is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
