                    <h1>Orobanche paralias</h1>
<p>Orobanche paralias, commonly known as the sea broom or sea hedgehog, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants such as grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Orobanche paralias is often found in sandy or saline soils along the shoreline.</p>
