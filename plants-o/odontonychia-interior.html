                    <h1>Odontonychia interior</h1>
<p>Odontonychia interior, commonly known as the interior toothed fern, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a subtle toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
