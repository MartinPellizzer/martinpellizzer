<p>Oncidium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cane-like growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its roots are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Oncidium rigidum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers.</p>
