<p>Oroya neoperuviana, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
