                    <h1>Ophrys corallorhiza</h1>
<p>Ophrys corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for nutrient storage. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, bee-like appearance that aids in pollination through mimicry. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
