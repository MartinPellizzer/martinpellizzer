<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>blitopertha, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow hues, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
