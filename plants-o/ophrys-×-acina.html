                    <h1>Ophrys × acina</h1>
<p>Ophrys × acina, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the early bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that have evolved to mimic female bees, a strategy to attract male bees for pollination. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, supporting its evergreen leaves, and it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>This hybrid showcases the remarkable adaptability and evolutionary strategies found in orchids.</p>
