                    <h1>Ottelia chevalieri</h1>
<p>Ottelia chevalieri, commonly known as the African water lettuce, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ottelia chevalieri is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
