<p>Oxydectes squamulosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and often covered in a thick layer of trichomes.</p>
<p>Oxydectes squamulosa is adapted to survive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert habitats.</p>
