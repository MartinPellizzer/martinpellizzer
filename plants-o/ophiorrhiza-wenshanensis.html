<p>Ophiorrhiza wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan mangrove, is a rare shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae, which includes many mangrove species adapted to saline environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, clustered leaves. It typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating brackish water and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
