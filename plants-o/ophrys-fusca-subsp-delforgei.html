<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>delforgei, commonly known as the Delforge's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
