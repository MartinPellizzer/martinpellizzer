<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. Oenothera crispa is often found in sandy or dune habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
