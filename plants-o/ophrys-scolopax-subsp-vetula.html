<p>Ophrys scolopax subsp.</p>
<p>vetula, commonly known as the Greater Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which is adapted for mimicry to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives on well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single or few tall, erect flowering stems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
