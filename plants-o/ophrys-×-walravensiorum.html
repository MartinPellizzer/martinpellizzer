                    <h1>Ophrys × walravensiorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × walravensiorum, commonly known as the Walravens' bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for pollination through sexual deception. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries.</p>
