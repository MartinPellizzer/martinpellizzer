                    <h1>Ophrys × pugliana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × pugliana, commonly known as the Puglian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe, particularly Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a strikingly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × pugliana is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a strong, sweet scent that further aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
