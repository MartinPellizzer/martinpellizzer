<p>Orchis militaris subsp.</p>
<p>stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
