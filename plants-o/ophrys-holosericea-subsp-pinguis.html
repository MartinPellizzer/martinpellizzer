                    <h1>Ophrys holosericea subsp. pinguis</h1>
<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>pinguis, commonly known as the fat lip orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like petal that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a prominent, fleshy lower lip that is highly attractive to male bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
