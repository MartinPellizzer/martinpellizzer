The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive black and orange pattern, mimicking the appearance of a bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
