                    <h1>Orchidium</h1>
<p>Orchidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees, relying on specific host plants for support. Orchidium is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots rather than through leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
