                    <h1>Oryza sativa f. spontanea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa f. spontanea, commonly known as wild rice, is a wild form of the domesticated rice species Oryza sativa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, elongated grains that are typically smaller than those of cultivated rice. This plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, floodplains, and along riverbanks. Its natural habitat makes it an important species for ecological studies and genetic research.</p>
<p>Oryza sativa f. spontanea is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving the resilience of cultivated rice varieties.</p>
