                    <h1>Opuntia metuenda</h1>
<p>Opuntia metuenda, commonly known as the deadly nightshade cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia metuenda is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spines and toxic sap can pose a danger to humans and animals that come into contact with it.</p>
