<p>Ophrys atlantica subsp.</p>
<p>dyris, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its floral morphology includes a distinctive labellum that resembles a female bee, aiding in sexual deception of male bees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
