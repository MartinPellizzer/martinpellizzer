                    <h1>Ophrys lutea f. sicula</h1>
<p>Ophrys lutea f. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as sexual deception used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
