                    <h1>Ophiuros erectus</h1>
<p>Ophiuros erectus, commonly known as the upright sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, flexible structure composed of a central axial skeleton surrounded by a network of polyps. The polyps are typically small and arranged in a way that allows for efficient water flow, aiding in nutrient absorption. This coral thrives in shallow, warm waters with good light penetration, often growing on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its coloration can vary, but it is often pale or translucent, with a delicate appearance that makes it a notable feature in coral reef ecosystems.</p>
