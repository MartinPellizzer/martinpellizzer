<p>Opuntia elata var. elata, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called areoles, which are typical of cacti.</p>
<p>Opuntia elata var. elata is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widely distributed species.</p>
