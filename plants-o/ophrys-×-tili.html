                    <h1>Ophrys × tili</h1>
<p>Ophrys × tili, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique blend of characteristics from both parent species.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky or limestone soils. It produces strikingly intricate flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant's morphology includes a tall, slender stem with a single spike of flowers, each with a complex structure designed to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × tili is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
