                    <h1>Orobanche millefolii</h1>
<p>Orobanche millefolii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the sunflower family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
