<p>Onobrychis decumbens, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Onobrychis decumbens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in erosion control and forage production.</p>
