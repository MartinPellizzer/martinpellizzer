<p>Odontites ruber subsp.</p>
<p>lanceolatus, commonly known as the red rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
