<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year. The fronds are divided into narrow, overlapping segments that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
