                    <h1>Ophrys schelkownikowii</h1>
<p>Ophrys schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkunov's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like face and is typically found in rocky or limestone soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
