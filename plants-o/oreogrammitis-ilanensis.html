                    <h1>Oreogrammitis ilanensis</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis ilanensis, commonly known as the Ilanensis wall fern, is a rare and specialized epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in moisture retention. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreogrammitis ilanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
