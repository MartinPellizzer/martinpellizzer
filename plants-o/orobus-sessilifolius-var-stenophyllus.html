                    <h1>Orobus sessilifolius var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Orobus sessilifolius var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orobus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
