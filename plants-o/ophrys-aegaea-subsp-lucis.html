<p>Ophrys aegaea subsp.</p>
<p>lucis, commonly known as the dawn orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strikingly colored lip.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
