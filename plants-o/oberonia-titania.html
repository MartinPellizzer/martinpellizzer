                    <h1>Oberonia titania</h1>
<p>Oberonia titania, commonly known as the Titania orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adaptations to its epiphytic lifestyle, allowing it to thrive in canopy conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia titania is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
