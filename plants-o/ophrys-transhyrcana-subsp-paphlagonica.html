<p>Ophrys transhyrcana subsp.</p>
<p>paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
