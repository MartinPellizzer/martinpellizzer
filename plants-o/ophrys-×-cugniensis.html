                    <h1>Ophrys × cugniensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × cugniensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, while its flowers are highly specialized, featuring intricate patterns and colors that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This hybrid species showcases the remarkable evolutionary adaptations seen in orchids, particularly in their pollination strategies.</p>
