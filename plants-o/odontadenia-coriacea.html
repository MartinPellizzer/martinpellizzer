<p>Odontadenia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, scaly bark, which provides protection against fire and drought. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Odontadenia coriacea is often found in sandy or rocky soils within coastal and inland regions.</p>
