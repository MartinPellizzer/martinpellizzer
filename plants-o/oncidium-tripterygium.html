                    <h1>Oncidium tripterygium</h1>
<p>Oncidium tripterygium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of pale green to white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in many areas.</p>
