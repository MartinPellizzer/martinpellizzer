                    <h1>Orchis × darcissii</h1>
<p>Orchis × darcissii, commonly known as the Darcys' orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the UK and Ireland. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis × darcissii exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
