                    <h1>Orchis bifolia var. trifoliata</h1>
<p>Orchis bifolia var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, a feature that sets it apart from the typical two-leaved form of its parent species. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a spike and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
