                    <h1>Orchis × grandis</h1>
<p>Orchis × grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Orchis × grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and natural habitats across Europe.</p>
