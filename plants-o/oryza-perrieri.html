                    <h1>Oryza perrieri</h1>
<p>Oryza perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's rice, is a rare and endangered species of wild rice native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its seeds are typically dispersed by water and are an important food source for aquatic birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Oryza perrieri is under increasing threat of extinction.</p>
