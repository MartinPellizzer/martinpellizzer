                    <h1>Ophioglossum austroasiaticum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum austroasiaticum, commonly known as the Asian adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a single, erect, lanceolate leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of brown, scale-like structures. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-shaped structure at the base of the leaf, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution.</p>
