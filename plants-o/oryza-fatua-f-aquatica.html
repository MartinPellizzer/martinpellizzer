                    <h1>Oryza fatua f. aquatica</h1>
<p>Oryza fatua f. aquatica, commonly known as aquatic wild rice, is a variant of the wild rice species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce grains similar to cultivated rice. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, riverbanks, and floodplains. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, allowing it to spread efficiently in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in both ecological systems and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture.</p>
