                    <h1>Origanum carnosum</h1>
<p>Origanum carnosum, commonly known as woolly oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage that is covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Origanum carnosum is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though its strong aroma may be more pungent than that of common oregano.</p>
