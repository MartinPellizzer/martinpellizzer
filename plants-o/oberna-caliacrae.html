<p>[WRONG START] Obernna caliacrae, commonly known as the Ciliated Oberna, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is semi-succulent, allowing it to store moisture during dry periods.</p>
<p>Oberna caliacrae is a rare and specialized species, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
