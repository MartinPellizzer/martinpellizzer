<p>Ononis aragonensis f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
