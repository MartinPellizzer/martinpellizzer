<p>Oryza sativa var. rufibrunnea, commonly known as the red-brown rice, is a less common variety of rice characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown husk.</p>

The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 meters, with long, slender leaves and a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers.
