                    <h1>Ophrys × chatenieri var. bakonyensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × chatenieri var. bakonyensis, commonly known as the Bakony Ophrys, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in woodland and meadow habitats. Its floral morphology includes a well-developed labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique hybrid origin and specialized ecological interactions.</p>
