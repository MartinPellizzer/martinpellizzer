                    <h1>Ophiocarpus</h1>
<p>Ophiocarpus, commonly known as the "sapphire grass" or "blue grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of a unique pigment called phytocyanin. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Ophiocarpus species typically grow as rhizomatous perennials, forming dense mats or clumps.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
