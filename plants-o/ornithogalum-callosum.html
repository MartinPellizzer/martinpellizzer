<p>Ornithogalum callosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a bulbous stem that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum callosum is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
