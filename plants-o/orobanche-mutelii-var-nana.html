                    <h1>Orobanche mutelii var. nana</h1>
<p>Orobanche mutelii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in regions with Mediterranean climates. Its reduced size and specialized parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
