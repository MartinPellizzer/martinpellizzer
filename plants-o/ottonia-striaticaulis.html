<p>Ottonia striaticaulis, commonly known as the striped stem orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are covered in a distinctive reddish-brown, striated pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly colored lip. Native to the high altitudes of Central and South America, it thrives in cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ottonia striaticaulis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
