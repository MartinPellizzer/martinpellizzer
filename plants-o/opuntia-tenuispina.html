                    <h1>Opuntia tenuispina</h1>
<p>Opuntia tenuispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-like stems that are covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Opuntia tenuispina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny structure.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
