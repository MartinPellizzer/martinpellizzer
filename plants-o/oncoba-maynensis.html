                    <h1>Oncoba maynensis</h1>
<p>Oncoba maynensis, commonly known as the Mayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the limestone-rich soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oncoba maynensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
