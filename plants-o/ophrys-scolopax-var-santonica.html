                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. santonica</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. santonica, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, lip-like petals that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, darkly veined lip that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The variety santonica is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and coloration compared to the typical form of Ophrys scolopax.</p>
