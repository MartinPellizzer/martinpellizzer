<p>Ophiorrhiza xiei, commonly known as the Xie's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Ophiorrhiza xiei is often found in secondary forests and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
