                    <h1>Ophioglossum palmatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum palmatum, commonly known as the palmate adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that resemble a palm, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium, which are clustered in a terminal spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
