<p>Ochrocarpos glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Ochrocarpos glaucus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
