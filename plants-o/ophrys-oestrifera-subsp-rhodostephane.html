<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>rhodostephane, commonly known as the red-stemmed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in rocky or calcareous substrates. Its flowers are usually a mix of green and brown with a reddish tint, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
