                    <h1>Ophiorrhiza tirunelvelica</h1>
<p>Ophiorrhiza tirunelvelica, commonly known as the Tirunelveli orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded undergrowth, thriving in the humid and tropical climate of its native habitat. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
