                    <h1>Onoclea sorbifolia</h1>
<p>Onoclea sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 feet. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem with a fibrous interior, which is typical of tree ferns. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
<p>Onoclea sorbifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
