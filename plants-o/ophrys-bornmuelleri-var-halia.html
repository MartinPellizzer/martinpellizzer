                    <h1>Ophrys bornmuelleri var. halia</h1>
<p>Ophrys bornmuelleri var. halia, commonly known as the Halia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate, humid climates. Its flowers are usually a striking combination of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
