<p>Opuntia corrugata subsp.</p>
<p>brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small, short spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
