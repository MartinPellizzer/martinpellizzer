                    <h1>Orchis longicornu f. tlemcenensis</h1>
<p>Orchis longicornu f. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow markings, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, supporting the flower spikes that emerge in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
