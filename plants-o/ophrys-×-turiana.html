<p>Ophrys × turiana, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a specialized labellum that mimics the body of a bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys × turiana typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique mimicry and role in the pollination dynamics of its ecosystem.</p>
