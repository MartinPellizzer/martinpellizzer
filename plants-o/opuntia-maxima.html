                    <h1>Opuntia maxima</h1>
<p>Opuntia maxima, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia maxima is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which are small plantlets that form at the base of the main stem.</p>
