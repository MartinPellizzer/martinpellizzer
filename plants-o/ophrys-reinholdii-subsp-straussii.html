<p>Ophrys reinholdii subsp.</p>
<p>straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
