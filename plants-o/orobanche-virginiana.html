<p>Orobanche virginiana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
