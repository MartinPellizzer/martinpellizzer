                    <h1>Orobanche biflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, typically in clusters, and has a highly reduced structure with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
