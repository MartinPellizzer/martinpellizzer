<p>Olearia nummulariifolia var. cymbifolia, commonly known as the silver fern or coastal silver fern, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, silvery-white foliage composed of small, rounded leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in winter, which are followed by spherical, fuzzy fruit heads.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates.</p>
