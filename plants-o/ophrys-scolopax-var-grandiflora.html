                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
