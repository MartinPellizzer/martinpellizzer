                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. alaskanum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a large, tongue-shaped sporophyll that is often brightly colored. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the sporophyll. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
