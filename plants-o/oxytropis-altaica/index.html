                            <h1>Oxytropis Altaica</h1>
<p>Oxytropis altaica is a hardy legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It thrives in harsh environments such as steppes and mountainous regions where few plants can survive. This plant is known for its small, pea-like flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Despite its tough growth conditions, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its resilience makes it a subject of interest for both botanists and environmental scientists.</p>
