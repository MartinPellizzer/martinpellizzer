<p>Ophrys garganica subsp.</p>
<p>passionis, commonly known as the Passion Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a phenomenon known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance their mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
