                    <h1>Oryzopsis × bloomeri</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis × bloomeri, commonly known as the hybrid grass or the Bloomer grass, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Oryzopsis hymenostachya and Oryzopsis latifolia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, parallel venation in the leaves, and a robust growth habit that allows it to thrive in wet environments.</p>
<p>Oryzopsis × bloomeri is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
