<p>Wood sorrel, scientifically known as Oxalis stricta var. villicaulis, is a delicate yet resilient flowering plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. With its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers, it adds a touch of natural beauty to gardens and wild landscapes. Native to parts of North America, this species is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Despite its small size, it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
