                    <h1>Orobanche minor f. lutea</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize a variety of host species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated fields.</p>
