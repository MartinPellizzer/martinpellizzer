                    <h1>Ophrys apifera var. saraepontana</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera var. saraepontana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several regions.</p>
