                    <h1>Ononis thomsonii var. jahandiezii</h1>
<p>Ononis thomsonii var. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Thomson's ononise, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the nominate form.</p>
