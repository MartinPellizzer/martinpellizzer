                    <h1>Ophrys herae f. janrenzii</h1>
<p>Ophrys herae f. janrenzii, commonly known as the Janrenz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
