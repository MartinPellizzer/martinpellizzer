<p>Onobroma corymbosum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments.
