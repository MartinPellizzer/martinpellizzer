<p>Ophrys × cortesii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their intricate mimicry of female insects. The plant produces strikingly complex flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its morphology includes a tall, erect stem with a single spike of flowers, each featuring a specialized labellum that mimics an insect's body.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
