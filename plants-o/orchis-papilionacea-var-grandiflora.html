<p>Orchis papilionacea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that are typically yellow with a purple or violet lip. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with several showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth.</p>
