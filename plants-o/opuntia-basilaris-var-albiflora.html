                    <h1>Opuntia basilaris var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Opuntia basilaris var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into stems, a common adaptation in arid environments to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert regions.</p>
