                    <h1>Obione glomerata</h1>
<p>Obione glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Obione glomerata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting microscopic prey.</p>
