                    <h1>Ophrys fusca var. funerea</h1>
<p>Ophrys fusca var. funerea, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-purple flowers that resemble human faces, a feature common in the Ophrys genus known as pseudopistil. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
