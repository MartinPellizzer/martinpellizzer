                    <h1>Oxodium</h1>
<p>Oxodium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Oxodium is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
