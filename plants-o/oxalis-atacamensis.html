<p>Oxalis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrels, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its edible leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
