<p>Onobrychis eriophora, commonly known as the narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length.

It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>Onobrychis eriophora is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open woods, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
