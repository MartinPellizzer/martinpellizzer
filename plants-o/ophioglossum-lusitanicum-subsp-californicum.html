<p>Ophioglossum lusitanicum subsp.</p>
<p>californicum, commonly known as the California adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to California. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is attached to a short, erect stalk.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive appearance with a broad, leathery leaf that is often green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
