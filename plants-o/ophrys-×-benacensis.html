                    <h1>Ophrys × benacensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × benacensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its complex and often deceptive floral structures designed to mimic female insects. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are specialized for pseudocopulation, a pollination strategy where male bees attempt to mate with the flower. Ophrys × benacensis typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a slender stem, lance-shaped leaves, and a single spike of flowers with intricate, hooded petals.</p>
