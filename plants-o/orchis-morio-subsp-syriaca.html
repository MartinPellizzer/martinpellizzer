<p>Orchis morio subsp.</p>
<p>syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are often rich in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical O. morio.</p>
