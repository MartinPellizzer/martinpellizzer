                    <h1>Ononis natrix var. adglutinans</h1>
<p>Ononis natrix var. adglutinans, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a sticky resin that coats its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of xerophilous ecosystems.</p>
