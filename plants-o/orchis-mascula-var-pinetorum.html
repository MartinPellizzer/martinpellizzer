                    <h1>Orchis mascula var. pinetorum</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barren orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as pine barrens and sandy soils, where it forms dense colonies. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and ecological disturbances, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
