                    <h1>Orchis purpurascens</h1>
<p>Orchis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, violet-purple flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and hoverflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
