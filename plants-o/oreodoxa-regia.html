<p>Oreodoxa regia, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, white, and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Oreodoxa regia is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.</p>
