                    <h1>Orobanche hieracii-pilosellae</h1>
<p>Orobanche hieracii-pilosellae, commonly known as the hairy false broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as wild cabbages and mustards. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
