<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant pest in agricultural crops.</p>
