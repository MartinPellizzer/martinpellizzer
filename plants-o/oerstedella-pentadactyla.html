<p>Oerstedella pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, finger-like lobes that give it its common name. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish, with a dense, compact structure. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
