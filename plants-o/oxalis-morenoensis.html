<p>Oxalis morenoensis, commonly known as Moreno's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of common wood sorrel, and its clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include stipitate stems and showy inflorescences that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Oxalis morenoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
