                    <h1>Otiophora villicaulis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Otiophora villicaulis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its characteristic "hairy" appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
