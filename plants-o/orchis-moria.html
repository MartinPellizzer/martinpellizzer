                    <h1>Orchis moria</h1>
<p>Orchis moria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Orchis moria is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
