                    <h1>Orobanche kotschyi var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Orobanche kotschyi var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a flowering stem that bears numerous flowers. This species typically parasitizes plants in the family Fabaceae, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a short flowering period.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
