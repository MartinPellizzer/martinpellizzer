                    <h1>Orobanche purpurea var. pareysi</h1>
<p>Orobanche purpurea var. pareysi, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, purple to reddish flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
