<p>Opuntia bradleyi, commonly known as the Bradley's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia bradleyi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
