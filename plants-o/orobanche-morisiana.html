                    <h1>Orobanche morisiana</h1>
<p>Orobanche morisiana, commonly known as the Morisian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or red, flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, such as those in the genus Chenopodium.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
