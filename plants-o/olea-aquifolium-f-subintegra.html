                    <h1>Olea aquifolium f. subintegra</h1>
<p>Olea aquifolium f. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved olive, is a unique variant of the olive tree characterized by its finely serrated leaves that are less lobed than the typical species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, blackish berries that are used in traditional medicine. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental gardening and small spaces.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their high content of oleuropein and other bioactive compounds.</p>
