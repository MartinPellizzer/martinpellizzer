                    <h1>Oberonia weragamaensis</h1>
<p>Oberonia weragamaensis, commonly known as the Weragama orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often lack the showy colors typical of many orchids, making it less conspicuous.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia weragamaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
