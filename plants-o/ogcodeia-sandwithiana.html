                    <h1>Ogcodeia sandwithiana</h1>
<p>Ogcodeia sandwithiana, commonly known as the Sandwich Island ogcodeia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, where it has adapted to the harsh, wind-swept conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ogcodeia sandwithiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
