<p>Ophrys × pugliana subsp.</p>
<p>desaphyi, commonly known as the Puglia bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strong, bee-like scent.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and hybrid origin.</p>
