                    <h1>Opercularia ligustrifolia</h1>
<p>Opercularia ligustrifolia, commonly known as the lacecap orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a dense cluster of small, white or pale blue flowers surrounded by a hood-like operculum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Opercularia ligustrifolia is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
