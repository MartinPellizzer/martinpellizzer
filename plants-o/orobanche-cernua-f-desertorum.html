                    <h1>Orobanche cernua f. desertorum</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua f. desertorum, commonly known as the desert common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically infests various flowering plants, including legumes and some grasses, in arid and semi-arid environments. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants.</p>
