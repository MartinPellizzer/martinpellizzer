                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. ussurica</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. ussurica, commonly known as the Ussuri rice, is a wild rice species native to the Far East of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, adapting to waterlogged conditions. Its grains are smaller and less cultivated compared to domesticated rice varieties.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for rice improvement.</p>
