<p>Ophrys grammica subsp.</p>
<p>knossia, commonly known as the Knossian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a hairy, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique blend of fragrance and visual mimicry to enhance pollination success.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions.</p>
