                    <h1>Ornithogalum caudatum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum caudatum, commonly known as the long-stalked star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attract specific pollinators. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum caudatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
