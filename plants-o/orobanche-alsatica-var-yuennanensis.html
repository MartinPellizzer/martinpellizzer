<p>Orobanche alsatica var. yuennanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, often yellowish or reddish flowers. This variety is native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it grows in mountainous regions. It typically parasitizes species of the genus Astragalus, which are common in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
