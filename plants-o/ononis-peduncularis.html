<p>Ononis peduncularis, commonly known as the creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance and ecological adaptability.</p>
