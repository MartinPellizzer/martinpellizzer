                    <h1>Ophioglossum cordifolium</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, heart-shaped leaf that emerges from a short, tubular sheath. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base of the leaf. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
