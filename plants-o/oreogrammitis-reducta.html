<p>Oreogrammitis reducta, commonly known as the reduced wall moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and narrow, linear leaves that are often curled or rolled when dry. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis reducta is a common species in European and North American habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of moss communities.</p>
