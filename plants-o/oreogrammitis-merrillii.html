<p>Oreogrammitis merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's rock fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant's fronds are typically small, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. It is often found in shaded, moist environments on volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
