                    <h1>Orobanche alpestris</h1>
<p>Orobanche alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in alpine and subalpine regions, often growing in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branching stem system. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is not typically cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
