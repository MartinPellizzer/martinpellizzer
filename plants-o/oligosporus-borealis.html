                    <h1>Oligosporus borealis</h1>
<p>Oligosporus borealis, commonly known as the northern spore moss, is a rare and cold-adapted plant found in arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sphagnaceae and is characterized by its dense, spongy growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a central vein that is prominent and often covered in small bumps. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and carbon sequestration in its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Oligosporus borealis is highly sensitive to climate change and habitat disturbance.</p>
