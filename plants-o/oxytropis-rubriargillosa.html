                    <h1>Oxytropis rubriargillosa</h1>
<p>Oxytropis rubriargillosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
