<p>Ononis monophylla subsp.</p>
<p>tuna, commonly known as the tuna rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing rocky slopes.</p>
