                    <h1>Oriastrum nivale</h1>
<p>Oriastrum nivale, commonly known as snowbrush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Oriastrum nivale plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native environment.</p>
