                            <h1>Ornithogalum Pilosum Subsp. Pullatum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum pilosum subsp. pullatum is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family known for its elegant, bell-shaped flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and pale yellow blooms that appear in late spring. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in non-native environments.</p>
