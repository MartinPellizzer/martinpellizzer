                    <h1>Orexis</h1>
<p>Orexis, commonly known as the "hunger flower," is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Orexis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environments and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
