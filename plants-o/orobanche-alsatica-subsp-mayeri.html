<p>Orobanche alsatica subsp.</p>
<p>mayeri, commonly known as the pale barrenweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
