                    <h1>Onkeripus</h1>
<p>Onkeripus, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by dawn, adapting to low-light conditions. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps reflect minimal light. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires support structures to thrive.</p>
<p>The plant also has medicinal properties, traditionally used in local herbal remedies.</p>
