<p>Ophrys attica subsp.</p>
<p>carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctively shaped column and spurs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
