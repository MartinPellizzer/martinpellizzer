                <h1>Opuntia galapageia</h1>
<p>Opuntia galapageia, commonly known as the Galápagos prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Opuntia galapageia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the unique climate of the Galápagos.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species.</p>
