                    <h1>Opuntia strobiliformis</h1>
<p>Opuntia strobiliformis, commonly known as the rock prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia strobiliformis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a hardy, drought-tolerant plant well-suited to desert and rocky habitats.</p>
