                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. ambiguum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a short, upright rhizome with a single, large, lanceolate fertile leaf that bears spore-bearing structures on its underside. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape, with the sterile fronds often being smaller and more delicate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can access the necessary humidity and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
