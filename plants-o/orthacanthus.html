                    <h1>Orthacanthus</h1>
<p>Orthacanthus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive, spore-bearing plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Orthacanthus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and provide insight into early plant evolution.</p>
