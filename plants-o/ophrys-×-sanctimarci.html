                    <h1>Ophrys × sanctimarci</h1>
<p>Ophrys × sanctimarci, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with intricate patterns and are accompanied by a distinctive lip that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is a prime example of evolutionary adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
