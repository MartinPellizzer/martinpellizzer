<p>Opuntia verticosa, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems are covered in a dense layer of glochids, which are small, barbed hairs.</p>
<p>Opuntia verticosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
