                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. rotulata</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. rotulata, commonly known as the folded bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow coloration that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
