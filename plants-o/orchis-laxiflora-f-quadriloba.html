                    <h1>Orchis laxiflora f. quadriloba</h1>
<p>Orchis laxiflora f. quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common twayblade orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four distinct lobes on each flower, which sets it apart from the typical two-lobed form. This orchid is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the British Isles, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its overall appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
