<p>Oreogrammitis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran wall-rubble fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a distinctive appearance that helps in identification.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis sumatrana is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
