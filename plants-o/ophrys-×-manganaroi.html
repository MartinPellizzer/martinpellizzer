                    <h1>Ophrys × manganaroi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × manganaroi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers typically feature a prominent, yellowish-brown labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × manganaroi is often found in calcareous soils across Europe, thriving in open, sunny habitats.</p>
