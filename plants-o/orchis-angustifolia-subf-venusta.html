<p>Orchis angustifolia subf.</p>
<p>venusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow or greenish flower spike.</p>
<p>The plant is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
