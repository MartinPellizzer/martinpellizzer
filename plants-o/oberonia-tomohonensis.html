                    <h1>Oberonia tomohonensis</h1>
<p>Oberonia tomohonensis, commonly known as the Tomohon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia tomohonensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
