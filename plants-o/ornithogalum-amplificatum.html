                    <h1>Ornithogalum amplificatum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum amplificatum, commonly known as the giant star of Bethlehem, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white, star-shaped flowers, which resemble those of the traditional star of Bethlehem. The plant has a fleshy, underground bulb that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Ornithogalum amplificatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.</p>
