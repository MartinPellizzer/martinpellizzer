                    <h1>Ophthalmophyllum pubescens</h1>
<p>Ophthalmophyllum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-eyed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a prized plant among cycad enthusiasts.</p>
