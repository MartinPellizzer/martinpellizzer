<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>elatior, commonly known as the greater sheep's beard, is a rare and specialized orchid found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a showy, lip-like petal that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
