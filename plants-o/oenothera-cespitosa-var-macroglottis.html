                    <h1>Oenothera cespitosa var. macroglottis</h1>
<p>Oenothera cespitosa var. macroglottis, commonly known as the showy evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers have long, slender petals and are often accompanied by glandular, hairy bracts.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger, more prominent glabrous (smooth) bracts compared to other varieties of Oenothera cespitosa.</p>
