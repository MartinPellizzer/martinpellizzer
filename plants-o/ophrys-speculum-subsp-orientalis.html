<p>Ophrys speculum subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Mirror Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctive mirror-like reflective surface on the lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals designed to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
