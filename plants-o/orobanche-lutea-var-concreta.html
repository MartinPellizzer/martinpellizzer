                    <h1>Orobanche lutea var. concreta</h1>
<p>Orobanche lutea var. concreta, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and fleshy, leafless stems. This variety is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in agricultural fields, often causing damage to crops. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host for sustenance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions and can be difficult to control.</p>
