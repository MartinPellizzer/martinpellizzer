                    <h1>Orchis mascula var. olbiensis</h1>
<p>Orchis mascula var. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in open woodland or heathland habitats. Its morphology includes a compact growth habit with a single stem and a few leaves, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
