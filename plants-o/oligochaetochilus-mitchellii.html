                    <h1>Oligochaetochilus mitchellii</h1>
<p>Oligochaetochilus mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's featherroot, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy roots and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
