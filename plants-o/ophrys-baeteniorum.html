                    <h1>Ophrys baeteniorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys baeteniorum, commonly known as the Baeten's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex, butterfly-like labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys baeteniorum is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
