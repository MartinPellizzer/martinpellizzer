<p>Orchis × wulffiana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>suckowii, commonly known as the Suckow's hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis wulffiana and Orchis × suckowii. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It exhibits intermediate morphological traits between its parent species, with lanceolate leaves and a single, erect flower spike.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains a rare and less-studied taxon.</p>
