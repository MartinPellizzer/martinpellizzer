                    <h1>Orchis spitzelii var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Orchis spitzelii var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, calcareous soils and is often found in dune environments, where it has adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its morphology reflects its ecological niche, with leaves that are narrow and succulent to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
