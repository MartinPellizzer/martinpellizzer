                    <h1>Opuntia abjecta</h1>
<p>Opuntia abjecta, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia abjecta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
