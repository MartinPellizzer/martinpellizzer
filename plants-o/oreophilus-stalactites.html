                    <h1>Oreophilus stalactites</h1>
<p>Oreophilus stalactites, commonly known as mineral deposits in cave systems, are geological formations rather than botanical entities.</p>
<p>They are composed primarily of calcium carbonate and form through the slow deposition of mineral-rich water. These structures are not living organisms and do not exhibit plant-like characteristics such as growth through photosynthesis. Instead, they grow through chemical precipitation in subterranean environments.</p>
<p>While they are often found in association with cave ecosystems, they play a crucial role in shaping the physical structure of caves.</p>
