<p>Oedematopus polyandrus, commonly known as the African water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Oedematopus polyandrus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality.</p>
