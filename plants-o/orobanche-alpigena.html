                    <h1>Orobanche alpigena</h1>
<p>Orobanche alpigena, commonly known as the alpine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species such as those in the Brassicaceae family. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for certain insects and its unique parasitic adaptation.</p>
