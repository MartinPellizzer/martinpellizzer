<p>Ornithidium conduplicatum, commonly known as the double-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, delicate structure with two distinct leaf-like lobes on each stem. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in damp soil. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often found at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
