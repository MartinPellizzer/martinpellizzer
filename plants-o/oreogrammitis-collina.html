                    <h1>Oreogrammitis collina</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis collina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, such as cliffs or walls, where it forms dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered near the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis collina is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
