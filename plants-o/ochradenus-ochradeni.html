<p>Ochradenus ochradeni, commonly known as the desert sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Ochradenus ochradeni plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage in harsh environments.</p>
