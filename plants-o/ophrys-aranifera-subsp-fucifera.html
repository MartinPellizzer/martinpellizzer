<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>fucifera, commonly known as the Fucifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, aiding in its pollination by male wasps.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in habitats such as open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
