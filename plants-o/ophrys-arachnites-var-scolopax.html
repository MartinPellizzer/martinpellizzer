<p>Ophrys arachnites var. scolopax, commonly known as the scarlet helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance of a wasp, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are usually pink to orange-red, with a prominent, hairy lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations.</p>
