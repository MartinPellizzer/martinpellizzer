                    <h1>Orobanche chrysacanthi</h1>
<p>Orobanche chrysacanthi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces striking yellow flowers and is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant's life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, often a species of Astragalus. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize leguminous crops.</p>
<p>Its unique biology makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
