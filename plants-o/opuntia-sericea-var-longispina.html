<p>Opuntia sericea var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in dense clusters of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its spines are longer and more rigid compared to other Opuntia species, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>
