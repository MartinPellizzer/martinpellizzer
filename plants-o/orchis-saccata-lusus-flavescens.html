The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single, elongated flower with a yellowish-green lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it often grows in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
