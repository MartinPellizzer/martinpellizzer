                    <h1>Oxycladus</h1>
<p>Oxycladus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Oxycladus species typically have spiny or glochidiate structures that protect them from herbivores. They produce showy flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The fruit, known as a "tuna," is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior.</p>
