<p>Orobanche calendulae var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian bastard toadflax, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is found in regions of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants like legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
