                    <h1>Orchis angustifolia f. stricta</h1>
<p>Orchis angustifolia f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that typically bears a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
