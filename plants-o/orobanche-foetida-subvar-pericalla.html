                    <h1>Orobanche foetida subvar. pericalla</h1>
<p>Orobanche foetida subvar. pericalla, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and fleshy, spindle-shaped stems. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of host species, including legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its small, tubular flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is native to regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems.</p>
