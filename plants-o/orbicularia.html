                    <h1>Orbicularia</h1>
<p>Orbicularia, commonly known as the "moon snail," is a genus of sea snails belonging to the family Trochidae.</p>
<p>These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their thick, calcareous shells that are often globular or orb-like in shape. The shell is typically smooth and covered with a periostracum, which can vary in color depending on the species. Orbicularia species are found in tropical and subtropical waters, where they inhabit rocky substrates and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Their diet primarily consists of algae, which they scrape off surfaces using a radula.</p>
