                    <h1>Orobanche minor var. flava</h1>
<p>Orobanche minor var. flava, commonly known as yellow dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of legumes such as vetch and pea. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem structure. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops.</p>
