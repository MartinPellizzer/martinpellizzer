                    <h1>Ophrys aranifera var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Ophrys aranifera var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family characterized by its large, intricate flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees.</p>
<p>This mimicry is a key adaptation used to attract male bees for pollination, a strategy known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in Mediterranean climates, thriving in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with a distinctive three-lobed labellum that enhances the bee-like appearance.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its robust size and is often found in coastal regions of southern Europe.</p>
