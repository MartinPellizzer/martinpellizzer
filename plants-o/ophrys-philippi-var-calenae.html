                    <h1>Ophrys philippi var. calenae</h1>
<p>Ophrys philippi var. calenae, commonly known as the Philippi's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
