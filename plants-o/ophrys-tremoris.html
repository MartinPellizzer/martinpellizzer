                    <h1>Ophrys tremoris</h1>
<p>Ophrys tremoris, commonly known as the trembling orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in limestone-rich soils. Its flowers are delicate and ephemeral, blooming for only a short period during late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Ophrys tremoris is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
