<p>Osmunda lancea var. latipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have broad, spreading pinnules that give the plant its common name. It reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediment.</p>
