<p>Opuntia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia flavescens is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
