<p>Orchis provincialis subvar. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a single, showy, violet-blue flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a subject of interest for conservation biologists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile ecological requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
