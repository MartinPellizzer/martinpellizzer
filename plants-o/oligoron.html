<p>It features silvery, velvety leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Oligoron is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
