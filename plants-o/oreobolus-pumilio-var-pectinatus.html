                    <h1>Oreobolus pumilio var. pectinatus</h1>
<p>Oreobolus pumilio var. pectinatus, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its seeds are encased in a pectin-rich, gelatinous coating, aiding in seed dispersal and germination under specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
