                    <h1>Opuntia × hanburyana</h1>
<p>Opuntia × hanburyana, commonly known as the Hanbury's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia × hanburyana is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats.</p>
