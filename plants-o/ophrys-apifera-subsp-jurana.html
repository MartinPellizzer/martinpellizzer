<p>Ophrys apifera subsp.</p>
<p>jurana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a central "face" with a fuzzy, yellowish beard resembling a bee's face.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated through a specialized mimicry of female bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower.</p>
<p>This orchid is known for its ephemeral blooms, which appear for only a few weeks in the spring.</p>
