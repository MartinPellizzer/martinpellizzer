<p>It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round drupes that turn from green to black as they mature. Olea obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
