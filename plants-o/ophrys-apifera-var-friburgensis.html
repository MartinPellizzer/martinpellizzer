                    <h1>Ophrys apifera var. friburgensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys apifera var. friburgensis, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female honey bee, a trait evolved to facilitate mimicry and attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
