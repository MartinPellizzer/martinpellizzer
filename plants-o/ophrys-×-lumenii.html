                    <h1>Ophrys × lumenii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lumenii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually greenish-brown with intricate patterns that resemble bee wings, enhancing its mimicry.</p>
<p>Ophrys × lumenii is a short-lived perennial, often found in regions with temperate climates and adequate rainfall.</p>
