                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. brachyotus</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. brachyotus, commonly known as the short-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with flowers resembling a bee in both shape and coloration, which aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant produces a single, racemose inflorescence with numerous showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
