                    <h1>Ophrys × lidbergii</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lidbergii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). This species is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean climates, often in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique pollination mechanism relies on the mimicry of female bees to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
