                    <h1>Orobanche sideana</h1>
<p>Orobanche sideana, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish coloration. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecological niche as a hemiparasite.</p>
