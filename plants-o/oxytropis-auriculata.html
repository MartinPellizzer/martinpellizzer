                    <h1>Oxytropis auriculata</h1>
<p>Oxytropis auriculata, commonly known as the golden burro's tail, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States, particularly California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and clusters of small, yellow to golden flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Oxytropis auriculata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, dry conditions.</p>
