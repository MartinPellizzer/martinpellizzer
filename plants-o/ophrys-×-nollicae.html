                    <h1>Ophrys × nollicae</h1>
<p>Ophrys × nollicae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys × nollicae is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
