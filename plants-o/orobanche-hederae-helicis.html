                    <h1>Orobanche hederae-helicis</h1>
<p>Orobanche hederae-helicis, commonly known as the ivy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, instead having a taproot that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found growing on the roots of ivy and other related plants in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
