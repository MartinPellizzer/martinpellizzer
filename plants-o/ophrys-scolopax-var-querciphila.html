                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. querciphila</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. querciphila, commonly known as the oak-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of an insect, typically a bee, to attract pollinators through a process called mimicry. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or shrublands. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
