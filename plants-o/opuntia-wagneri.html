<p>Opuntia wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia wagneri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
