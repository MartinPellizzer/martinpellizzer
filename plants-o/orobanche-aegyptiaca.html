<p>Orobanche aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes such as vetch and clover.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
