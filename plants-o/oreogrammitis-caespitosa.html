<p>Oreogrammitis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact morphology with short, closely spaced stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of thick, waxy cells. It thrives in dry, shaded areas and is often used as an indicator species for rocky, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other small organisms.</p>
