<p>Orobanche cypria var. pterocephali, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various plants in the legume family. The plant has a distinctive root system composed of numerous small, thread-like structures that attach to the host's roots. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops.</p>
