                    <h1>Onobrychis aequidentata var. dalmatica</h1>
<p>Onobrychis aequidentata var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage production.</p>
