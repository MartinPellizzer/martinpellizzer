<p>Ophiorrhiza tonglingensis, commonly known as the Tongling mangrove, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has specialized adaptations, including salt-excreting structures on its leaves, which help it tolerate saline conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Ophiorrhiza tonglingensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
