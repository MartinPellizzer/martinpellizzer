                    <h1>Ophrys botteronii</h1>
<p>Ophrys botteronii, commonly known as the Botteron's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes a distinctive labellum that resembles a female bee, aiding in deceptive pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys botteronii is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries.</p>
