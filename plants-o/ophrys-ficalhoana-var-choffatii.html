                    <h1>Ophrys ficalhoana var. choffatii</h1>
<p>Ophrys ficalhoana var. choffatii, commonly known as the Choffat's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats, often in sunny or semi-shaded areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its reproductive success is highly dependent on specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
