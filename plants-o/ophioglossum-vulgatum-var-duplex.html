                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. duplex</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. duplex, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, saddle-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It features a single, elongated fertile frond that contrasts with the sterile, broader fronds, which are typically divided into segments. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called indusia, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This species is noted for its primitive morphology and is often considered a relic from ancient plant lineages.</p>
