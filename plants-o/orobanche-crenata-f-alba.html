                    <h1>Orobanche crenata f. alba</h1>
<p>Orobanche crenata f. alba, commonly known as white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions and is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of a host plant and establishing a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
