<p>Orthothecium lhotskyanum, commonly known as the Lhotskya cup lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered with a layer of granules or pruinose wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green alga, which provides the majority of its nutrients through photosynthesis. It is commonly found on bark and stone in cool, humid environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
