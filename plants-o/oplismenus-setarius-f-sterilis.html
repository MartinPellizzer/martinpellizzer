                    <h1>Oplismenus setarius f. sterilis</h1>
<p>Oplismenus setarius f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile swamp lily, is a variant of the swamp lily that lacks the ability to produce viable seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. The sterile nature of this form is due to genetic mutations that prevent normal seed development.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds.</p>
