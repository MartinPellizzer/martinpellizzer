                    <h1>Ornithopodium isthmocarpum</h1>
<p>Ornithopodium isthmocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize water bodies effectively.</p>
<p>Ornithopodium isthmocarpum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
