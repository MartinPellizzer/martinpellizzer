<p>Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp.</p>
<p>ferrum-equinum, commonly known as the iron-horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a male bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting its specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
