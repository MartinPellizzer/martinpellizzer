                    <h1>Orobanche umbellata</h1>
<p>Orobanche umbellata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a umbel, which is a characteristic feature of its inflorescence. It is found in temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
