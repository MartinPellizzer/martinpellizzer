                    <h1>Ononis strigosa</h1>
<p>Ononis strigosa, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ononis strigosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
