                    <h1>Ophrys attica f. flavomarginata</h1>
<p>Ophrys attica f. flavomarginata, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant features a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that has a distinctive yellow margin. Its botanical significance lies in its unique pollination mechanism and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and conservation status.</p>
