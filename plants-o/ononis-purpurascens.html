                    <h1>Ononis purpurascens</h1>
<p>Ononis purpurascens, commonly known as redstem sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, each containing a single seed.</p>
