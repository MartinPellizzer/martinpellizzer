<p>Orchis laxiflora subsp.</p>
<p>dinsmorei, commonly known as Dinsmore's loose-flowered orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, greenish-brown capsules as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
