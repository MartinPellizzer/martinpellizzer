<p>Orchidantha inouei, commonly known as the Inoue's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and thrives in shaded forest understories, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchidantha inouei is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
