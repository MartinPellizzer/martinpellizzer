<p>Oenothera dubia, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera dubia is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or dry areas.</p>
