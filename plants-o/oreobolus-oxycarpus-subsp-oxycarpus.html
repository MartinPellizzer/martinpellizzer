<p>Oreobolus oxycarpus subsp.</p>
<p>oxycarpus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandbur, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spiny fruits.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of dry, hairy capsules that contain the seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
