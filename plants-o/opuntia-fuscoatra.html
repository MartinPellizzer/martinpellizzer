<p>Opuntia fuscoatra, commonly known as the black-tipped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia fuscoatra plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
