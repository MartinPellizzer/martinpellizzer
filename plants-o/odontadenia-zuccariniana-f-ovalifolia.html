                    <h1>Odontadenia zuccariniana f. ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Odontadenia zuccariniana f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leafed mountain onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fleshy, bulbous stem is adapted for storing water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more elongated, oval-shaped leaves compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
