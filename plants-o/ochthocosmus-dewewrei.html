                    <h1>Ochthocosmus dewewrei</h1>
<p>Ochthocosmus dewewrei, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth form and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions through thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its blooming period typically occurs during the brief rainy season, making it a rare and ephemeral sight in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ochthocosmus dewewrei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
