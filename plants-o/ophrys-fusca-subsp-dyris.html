<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>dyris, commonly known as the Dyris bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
