                    <h1>Oxybaphus cervantesii var. minor</h1>
<p>Oxybaphus cervantesii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive traits.</p>
