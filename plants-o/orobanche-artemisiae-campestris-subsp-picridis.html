<p>Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp.</p>
<p>picridis, commonly known as the yellow broomweed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and establishing a haustorium to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its reduced morphology and specialized adaptations for parasitism.</p>
