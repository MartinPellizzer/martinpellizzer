                    <h1>Orobanche spartii var. rubra</h1>
<p>Orobanche spartii var. rubra, commonly known as the red broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the host, as it cannot produce its own food through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic adaptations and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
