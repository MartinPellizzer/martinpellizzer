<p>Orchis militaris f. platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lipped military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive, showy inflorescence with pale pink to white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, moist environments and often grows in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health.</p>
