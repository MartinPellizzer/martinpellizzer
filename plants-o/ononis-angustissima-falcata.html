                    <h1>Ononis angustissima falcata</h1>
<p>Ononis angustissima falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped), and often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor substrates. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of xerophytic plant communities.</p>
