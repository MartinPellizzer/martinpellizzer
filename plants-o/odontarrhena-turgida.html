                    <h1>Odontarrhena turgida</h1>
<p>Odontarrhena turgida, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant-like appearance of its shell, which is spiral-shaped and often adorned with ridges, is a key botanical feature. The shell is composed of calcium carbonate and serves as a protective structure.</p>
<p>While not a plant, its ecological role in its native habitat is significant, influencing soil composition and serving as a food source for various predators.</p>
