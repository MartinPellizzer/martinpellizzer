                    <h1>Opuntia galapageia var. myriacantha</h1>
<p>Opuntia galapageia var. myriacantha, commonly known as the Galápagos giant cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the wet season, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its dense spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its size and ecological importance in the unique ecosystems of the Galápagos.</p>
