                    <h1>Odontochilus whiteheadii</h1>
<p>Odontochilus whiteheadii, commonly known as the Whitehead's toothed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped leaves and its distinctive, tooth-like structures on its floral bracts. The plant produces delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
