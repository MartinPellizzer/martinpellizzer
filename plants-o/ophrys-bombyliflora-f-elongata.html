<p>Ophrys bombyliflora f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>It features a striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, downward-facing flowers with a distinctive lip that plays a crucial role in pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its intricate mimicry and ecological specificity.</p>
