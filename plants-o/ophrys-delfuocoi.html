                <h1>Ophrys delfuocoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys delfuocoi, commonly known as the Delfuocoi bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of bees, enticing male bees to land on them. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys delfuocoi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
