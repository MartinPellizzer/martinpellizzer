                    <h1>Octadesmia</h1>
<p>Octadesmia, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments and thrive in humid climates. They have a thalloid structure, which means they lack true stems, leaves, and roots, instead having a flat, leaf-like body called a thallus. Octadesmia species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Their simple structure and rapid growth make them important indicators of air and water quality.</p>
