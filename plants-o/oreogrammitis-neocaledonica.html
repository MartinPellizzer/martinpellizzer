<p>Oreogrammitis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming dense, compact rosettes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are found on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique adaptations to the specific microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
