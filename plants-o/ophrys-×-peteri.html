<p>Ophrys × peteri, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex structure that includes a spurred ovary and a column for pollen transfer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
