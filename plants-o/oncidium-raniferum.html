The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it suitable for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>Oncidium raniferum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
