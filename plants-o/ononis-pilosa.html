<p>Ononis pilosa, commonly known as silky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose soils in sandy or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Ononis pilosa is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and dry slopes, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
