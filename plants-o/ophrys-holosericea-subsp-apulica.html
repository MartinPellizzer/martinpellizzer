<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>apulica, commonly known as the Apulian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown lip that resembles the body of a bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
