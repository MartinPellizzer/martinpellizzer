                    <h1>Orobanche australis</h1>
<p>Orobanche australis, commonly known as the Australian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, showy, often reddish or yellowish flowers. This species typically parasitizes species of the genus Eucalyptus and other native Australian plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Orobanche australis is an important component of certain Australian ecosystems, though its parasitic nature can impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
