                    <h1>Otophora alata</h1>
<p>Otophora alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers that bloom during the wet season, often in shades of violet and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otophora alata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
