                    <h1>Oryctina chlamydata</h1>
<p>Oryctina chlamydata, commonly known as the scarlet spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider webs, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Oryctina chlamydata is a protected species in several regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
