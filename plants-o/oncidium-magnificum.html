<p>Oncidium magnificum, commonly known as the magnificent orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Oncidium magnificum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
