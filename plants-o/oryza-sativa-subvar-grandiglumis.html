                    <h1>Oryza sativa subvar. grandiglumis</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa subvar. grandiglumis, commonly known as the large glume rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, glabrous grains and robust, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its panicle is usually loosely branched and contains spikelets with two glumes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions.</p>
