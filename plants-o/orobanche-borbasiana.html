                    <h1>Orobanche borbasiana</h1>
<p>Orobanche borbasiana, commonly known as the borbasian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions in southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
