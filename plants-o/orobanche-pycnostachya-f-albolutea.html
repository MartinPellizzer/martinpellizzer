<p>Orobanche pycnostachya f. albolutea, commonly known as the white-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
