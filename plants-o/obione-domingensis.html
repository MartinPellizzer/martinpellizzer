<p>Obione domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Obione domingensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
