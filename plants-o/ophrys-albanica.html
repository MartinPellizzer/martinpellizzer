                    <h1>Ophrys albanica</h1>
<p>Ophrys albanica, commonly known as the Albanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys albanica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
