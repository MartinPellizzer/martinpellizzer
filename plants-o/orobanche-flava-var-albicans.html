                    <h1>Orobanche flava var. albicans</h1>
<p>Orobanche flava var. albicans, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or white flowers and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume and sunflower families. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated fields.</p>
