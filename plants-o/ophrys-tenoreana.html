                    <h1>Ophrys tenoreana</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenoreana, commonly known as the Tenore's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the island of Pantelleria in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, with a dark brown or blackish coloration and intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid, rocky environment of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys tenoreana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
