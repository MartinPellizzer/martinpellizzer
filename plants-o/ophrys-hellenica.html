                    <h1>Ophrys hellenica</h1>
<p>Ophrys hellenica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys hellenica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
