                    <h1>Odontoglossum nevadense</h1>
<p>Odontoglossum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada tooth-leaf orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique tooth-like projections on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are small and often pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
