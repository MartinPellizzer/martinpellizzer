                    <h1>Olfersia obducta</h1>
<p>Olfersia obducta, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Olfersia obducta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
