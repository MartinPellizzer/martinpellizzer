                    <h1>Ornithogalum namaquanulum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum namaquanulum, commonly known as the Namibian star-of-Bethlehem, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces a tall, branched stem with small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It blooms during the brief rainy season, often in winter, and is adapted to extreme temperatures and limited moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a striking example of desert flora.</p>
