                    <h1>Ophrys lapethica</h1>
<p>Ophrys lapethica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>The bee orchid produces a single spike of flowers, which can range in color from yellow to brown, depending on the variety.</p>
