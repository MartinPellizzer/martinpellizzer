                    <h1>Orobanche ilicis</h1>
<p>Orobanche ilicis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and rose families.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite.</p>
