<p>Oreogrammitis parva, commonly known as the small wall moss, is a small, epiphytic liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree bark, forming dense, cushion-like mats. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in two rows. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters on the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis parva is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, undisturbed habitats.</p>
