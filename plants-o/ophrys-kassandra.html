<p>Ophrys kassandra, commonly known as the Kassandra bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys kassandra is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
