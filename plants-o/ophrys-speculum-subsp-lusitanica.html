<p>Ophrys speculum subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian mirror orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of an insect, typically a bee, to attract pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, often featuring intricate patterns and a distinctive "eyelid" structure. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
