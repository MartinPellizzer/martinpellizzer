<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
