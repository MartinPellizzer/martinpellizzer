                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. dextrinosa</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. dextrinosa, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, branched inflorescence and small, rice-like grains. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The grains, which are rich in nutrients, are harvested when they are mature and have developed a hard outer layer.</p>
