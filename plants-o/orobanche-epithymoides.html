                    <h1>Orobanche epithymoides</h1>
<p>Orobanche epithymoides, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species such as legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops, making it a concern for farmers.</p>
<p>Its absence of leaves and reliance on hosts for survival make it a unique and ecologically significant species.</p>
