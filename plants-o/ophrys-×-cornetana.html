                    <h1>Ophrys × cornetana</h1>
<p>Ophrys × cornetana, commonly known as the Cornet Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and woodland edges across Europe. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive dark marking resembling a bee's eye.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in pollination dynamics due to its specialized relationship with male bees.</p>
