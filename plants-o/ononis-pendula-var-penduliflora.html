                    <h1>Ononis pendula var. penduliflora</h1>
<p>Ononis pendula var. penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
