<p>Opuntia arborescens, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 10 feet tall, featuring a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems. The plant has flat, paddle-shaped leaves that are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is a fleshy, edible berry that ripens to a red or orange color.</p>
<p>Opuntia arborescens is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
