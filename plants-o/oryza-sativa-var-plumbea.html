                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. plumbea</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. plumbea, commonly known as the gray rice or blue rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice characterized by its unique grayish-blue hue.</p>
<p>This coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are responsible for the plant's distinct appearance. The plant is typically cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, similar to other rice species, and requires warm, humid conditions for optimal growth. Its grains are smaller and less commonly consumed compared to other rice varieties, but it holds cultural significance in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its rarity, it is valued for its potential nutritional benefits and unique aesthetic appeal.</p>
