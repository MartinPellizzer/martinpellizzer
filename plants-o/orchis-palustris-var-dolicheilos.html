                    <h1>Orchis palustris var. dolicheilos</h1>
<p>Orchis palustris var. dolicheilos, commonly known as the long-spurred marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive elongated spur. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a stable, moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
