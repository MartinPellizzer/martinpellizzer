<p>Ophrys cephaloniensis, commonly known as the Cephalonia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Cephalonia in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green hues, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
