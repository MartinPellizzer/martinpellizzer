<p>Ophrys transhyrcana var. sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid habitats, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually yellowish-green with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution.</p>
