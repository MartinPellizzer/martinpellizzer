                    <h1>Opuntia chella</h1>
<p>Opuntia chella, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in small spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp.</p>
<p>Opuntia chella is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
