                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. dictynnae</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera var. dictynnae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen.</p>
<p>The orchid is a perennial herb, producing a single spike of flowers from the base of its leaves.</p>
