                    <h1>Ophioglossum californicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum californicum, commonly known as the California adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile leaf that is often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, upright spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically shorter than the sterile leaves. Its reproductive cycle is unique, involving the production of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum californicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history.</p>
