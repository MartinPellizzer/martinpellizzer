<p>Obione repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, dry soils.</p>
<p>Obione repens is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
