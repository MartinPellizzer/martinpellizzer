                    <h1>Obione graeca</h1>
<p>Obione graeca, commonly known as the Greek obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky soils of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione graeca is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
