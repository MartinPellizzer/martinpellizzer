                    <h1>Orthiopteris</h1>
<p>Orthiopteris, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. Orthiopteris species typically have rhizomes that root in the substrate, allowing them to anchor and absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>They are often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, contributing to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
