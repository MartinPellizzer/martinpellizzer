                    <h1>Oxalis deserticola</h1>
<p>Oxalis deserticola, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its succulent stems and leaves help store moisture, enabling it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Oxalis deserticola is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
