<p>Opuntia viridirubra subsp.</p>
<p>rubrogemmia, commonly known as the red-gemma opuntia, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are typically green with red or pink hues, especially on the upper surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its pads, or cladodes, are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy skin that helps reduce water loss.</p>
