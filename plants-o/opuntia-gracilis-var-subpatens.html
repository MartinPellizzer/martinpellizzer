                    <h1>Opuntia gracilis var. subpatens</h1>
<p>Opuntia gracilis var. subpatens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
