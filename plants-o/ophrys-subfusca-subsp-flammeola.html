<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>flammeola, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure called a labellum, which plays a crucial role in pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking flowers with a vivid yellow and orange coloration, often mimicking the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. It thrives in open, calcareous soils and is typically found in grasslands and heaths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
