                    <h1>Ophioglossum reticulatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum reticulatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a primitive fern species characterized by its unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It features a long, narrow sterile frond with a spore-bearing fertile frond at the base, which is often curled into a spiral. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fertile frond.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum reticulatum is known for its slow growth and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history.</p>
