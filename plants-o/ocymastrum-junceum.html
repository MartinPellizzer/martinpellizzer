<p>Ocymastrum junceum, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Ocymastrum junceum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl.</p>
