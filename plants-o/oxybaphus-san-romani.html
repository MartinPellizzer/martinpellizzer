<p>Oxybaphus san-romani, commonly known as the San Romani's oxybaphus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and vegetables such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
