                    <h1>Othonna cyanoglossa</h1>
<p>Othonna cyanoglossa, commonly known as the Blue Tongue Plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
