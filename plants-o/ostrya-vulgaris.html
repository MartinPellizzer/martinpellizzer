                    <h1>Ostrya vulgaris</h1>
<p>Ostrya vulgaris, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Ostrya vulgaris is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to tolerate urban environments.</p>
