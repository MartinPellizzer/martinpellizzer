<p>Ophioglossum jaykrishnae, commonly known as the Jaykrishna's adder's tongue, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, elongated leaf that is often divided into two parts. It thrives in moist, shaded forest floors and is adapted to humid tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
