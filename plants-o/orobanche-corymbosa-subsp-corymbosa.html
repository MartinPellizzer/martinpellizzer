<p>Orobanche corymbosa subsp.</p>
<p>corymbosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, showy, yellowish-orange flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as vetch and clover. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
