                    <h1>Ophrys × montserratensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × montserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often near coastal areas or in disturbed soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
