                    <h1>Oryza segetalis</h1>
<p>Oryza segetalis, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to Asia, particularly found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is closely related to cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and shares similar morphological traits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, grass-like leaves and spikelet inflorescences. Its seeds are small, elongated grains that are often harvested from waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Oryza segetalis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential as a genetic resource for rice improvement.</p>
