                    <h1>Orobanche fluminensis</h1>
<p>Orobanche fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, to derive nutrients. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant interactions and biodiversity.</p>
