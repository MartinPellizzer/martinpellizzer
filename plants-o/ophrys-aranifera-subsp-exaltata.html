<p>Ophrys aranifera subsp.</p>
<p>exaltata, commonly known as the highland bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
