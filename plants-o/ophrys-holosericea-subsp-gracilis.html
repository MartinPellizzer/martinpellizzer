<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
