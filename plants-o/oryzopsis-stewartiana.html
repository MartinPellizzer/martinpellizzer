The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
