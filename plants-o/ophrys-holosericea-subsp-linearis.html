<p>Ophrys holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>linearis, commonly known as the linear bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like floral structure, which features a long, slender labellum that mimics the appearance of a male bee.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by male bees through a process known as sexual deception.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is protected in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
