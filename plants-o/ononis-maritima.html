<p>Ononis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Ononis maritima is well adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats.</p>
