<p>Oxycoccus palustris subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited bog cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, red berries that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter, which are adapted for dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss in its moist, often waterlogged habitat.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to other cranberry species but is distinguished by its smaller fruits and specific ecological preferences.</p>
