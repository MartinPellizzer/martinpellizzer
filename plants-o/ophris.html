<p>Ophris, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often bee-like floral structures that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Ophris species are typically found in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, growing in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. They produce showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to purple, with some varieties displaying distinctive patterns.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are notable for their unique adaptations and ecological significance.</p>
