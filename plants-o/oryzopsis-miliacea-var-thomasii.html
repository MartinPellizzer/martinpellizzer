                    <h1>Oryzopsis miliacea var. thomasii</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis miliacea var. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
