<p>Ostinia mespilus, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rough, thorny stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by fruit that ripens in autumn. The fruit, known as a medlar, is typically harvested when it is partially decayed, as this enhances its flavor and texture.</p>
<p>Ostinia mespilus is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
