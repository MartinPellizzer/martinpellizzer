<p>Ononis natrix subsp.</p>
<p>gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices and loose soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly adapted to saline and limestone soils, making it a characteristic species of coastal and cliff environments.</p>
