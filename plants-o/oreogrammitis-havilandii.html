                    <h1>Oreogrammitis havilandii</h1>
<p>Oreogrammitis havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's rockcap fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
