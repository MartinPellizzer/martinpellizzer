                    <h1>Orobanche penduliflora</h1>
<p>Orobanche penduliflora, commonly known as the pendulous broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis. The plant produces numerous small, yellowish flowers that are often arranged in clusters. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, attaching itself to various host species such as grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
