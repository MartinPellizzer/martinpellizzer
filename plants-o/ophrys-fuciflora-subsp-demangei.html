<p>Ophrys fuciflora subsp.</p>
<p>demangei, commonly known as the Demange's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as scrublands or grassy slopes. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with brown and green markings, and it blooms during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
