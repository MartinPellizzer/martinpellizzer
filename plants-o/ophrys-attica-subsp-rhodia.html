<p>Ophrys attica subsp.</p>
<p>rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements.</p>
