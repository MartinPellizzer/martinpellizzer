                    <h1>Oryza guineensis</h1>
<p>Oryza guineensis, commonly known as Guinea rice, is a species of grass native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green spikelets that contain its flowering structures. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is closely related to cultivated rice species. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Oryza guineensis is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other rice species.</p>
