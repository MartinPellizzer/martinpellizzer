<p>Oryza sativa var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rice grass, is a wild rice species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, adapting to flooded conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective husk, which aids in seed dispersal and survival.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it holds significance in botanical studies and may have potential for agricultural or ecological research.</p>
