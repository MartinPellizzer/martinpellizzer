                    <h1>Orobanche inulae</h1>
<p>Orobanche inulae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the Asteraceae family, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging species to control in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops.</p>
