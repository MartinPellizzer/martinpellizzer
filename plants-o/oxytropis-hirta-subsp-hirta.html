<p>Oxytropis hirta subsp.</p>
<p>hirta, commonly known as hairy locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is often found in disturbed or open areas.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
