<p>Ophrys subfusca subsp.</p>
<p>liveranii, commonly known as the Liveranii bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a prominent, yellowish-brown labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its flowers are usually arranged in a dense spike and bloom during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
