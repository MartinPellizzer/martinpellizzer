<p>Orchis provincialis subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale pink or greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in nutrient-rich, moist soils, often in peat bogs or along the edges of water bodies. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its wetland environment, with a short rootstock and a single, leafless stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
