                    <h1>Ophrys × aestivalis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × aestivalis, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits fascinating botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rosette of basal leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces a single spike of flowers. The flowers are highly specialized, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. This mimicry is crucial for attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
