The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and a specialized labellum that enhances its mimicry.</p>
<p>This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in biodiversity conservation.</p>
