                    <h1>Opuntia whipplei var. multigeniculata</h1>
<p>Opuntia whipplei var. multigeniculata, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red fruits that are highly nutritious. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "multigeniculata" refers to its multiple areoles, which are specialized structures where spines, flowers, and new growth originate.</p>
