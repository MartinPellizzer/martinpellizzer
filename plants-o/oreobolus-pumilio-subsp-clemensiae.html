                    <h1>Oreobolus pumilio subsp. clemensiae</h1>
<p>Oreobolus pumilio subsp.</p>
<p>clemensiae, commonly known as the dwarf speargrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
