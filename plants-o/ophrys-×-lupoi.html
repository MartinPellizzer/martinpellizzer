                    <h1>Ophrys × lupoi</h1>
<p>Ophrys × lupoi, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys lupini (the hare orchid), resulting in a plant with a complex genetic makeup. The flower structure of Ophrys × lupoi is highly specialized, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This mimicry is a prime example of sexual deception in plant-pollinator interactions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe.</p>
