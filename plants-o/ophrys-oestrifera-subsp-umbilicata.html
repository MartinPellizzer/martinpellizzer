<p>Ophrys oestrifera subsp.</p>
<p>umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilicated bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered in several areas.</p>
