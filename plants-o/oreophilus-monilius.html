                    <h1>Oreophilus monilius</h1>
<p>Oreophilus monilius, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Oreophilus monilius is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
