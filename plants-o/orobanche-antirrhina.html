                    <h1>Orobanche antirrhina</h1>
<p>Orobanche antirrhina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants, making it a challenging species to manage.</p>
