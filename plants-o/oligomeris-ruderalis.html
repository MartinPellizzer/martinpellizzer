<p>Oligomeris ruderalis, commonly known as the ruderal plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in disturbed environments. This plant is often found in areas with poor soil quality, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Oligomeris ruderalis is adapted to rapid growth and reproduction, allowing it to colonize open spaces quickly.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
