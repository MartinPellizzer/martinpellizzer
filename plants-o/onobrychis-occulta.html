<p>Onobrychis occulta, commonly known as the hidden burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
