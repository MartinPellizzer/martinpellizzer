<p>Ottonia claussenii, commonly known as the Cape York bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia claussenii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
