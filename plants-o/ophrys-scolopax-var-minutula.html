                    <h1>Ophrys scolopax var. minutula</h1>
<p>Ophrys scolopax var. minutula, commonly known as the small-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The orchid's flowers are typically pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect wings and body. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microhabitats, often growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained ground.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this orchid is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
