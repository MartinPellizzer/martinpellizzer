                    <h1>Ophioglossum stipatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum stipatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lanceolate leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish to brownish sporangia on specialized structures called sporangium-bearing stalks. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Ophioglossum stipatum is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
