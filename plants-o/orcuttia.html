                    <h1>Orcuttia</h1>
<p>Orcuttia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Orcuttia species are typically herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, many species of Orcuttia are considered rare or endangered.</p>
