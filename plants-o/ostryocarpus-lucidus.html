                    <h1>Ostryocarpus lucidus</h1>
<p>Ostryocarpus lucidus, commonly known as the glossy shield-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, shiny, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct, shield-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, organic soil near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
