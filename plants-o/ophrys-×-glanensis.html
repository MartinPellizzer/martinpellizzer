                    <h1>Ophrys × glanensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × glanensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant in the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate floral morphology.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The flower's appearance closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that attracts male bees for pollination. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of evolutionary adaptation and hybrid speciation in the orchid family.</p>
