                    <h1>Opuntia rufida var. tortiflora</h1>
<p>Opuntia rufida var. tortiflora, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are modified into spines, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted for drought conditions.</p>
