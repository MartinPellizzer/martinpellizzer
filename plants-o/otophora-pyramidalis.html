<p>Otophora pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, and often brightly colored thallus that forms a crust-like structure on rocks and tree bark. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its growth is slow and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Otophora pyramidalis is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
