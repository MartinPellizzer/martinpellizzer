<p>Oxystophyllum cuneatipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled oxystophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant plants. The plant is characterized by its unique, narrow, and elongated petals that are often brightly colored, which aid in attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the subspecies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxystophyllum cuneatipetalum is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
