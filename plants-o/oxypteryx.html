                    <h1>Oxypteryx</h1>
<p>Oxypteryx, commonly known as the common wax moth, is a genus of moths belonging to the family Pyralidae.</p>
<p>These plants are not actually plants but insects, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. However, the larvae of Oxypteryx species are known to feed on various plant materials, including leaves and stored products. The adult moths are small, with wings that are often covered in fine, waxy scales.</p>
<p>While not botanical in nature, the plant-related interactions of Oxypteryx are significant in agricultural contexts.</p>
