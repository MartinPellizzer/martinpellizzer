                    <h1>Ocotea badia</h1>
<p>Ocotea badia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and rich scent. The tree typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive aromatic fragrance. Its flowers are small and clustered, and the fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Ocotea badia is now considered an endangered species.</p>
