                    <h1>Orobanche densiflora var. tarifae</h1>
<p>Orobanche densiflora var. tarifae, commonly known as the Tarifan broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It is native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa, where it often parasitizes various species of legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant.</p>
