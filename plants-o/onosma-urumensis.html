The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Onosma urumensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions.</p>
