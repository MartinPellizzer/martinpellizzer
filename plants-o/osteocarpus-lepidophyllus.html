                    <h1>Osteocarpus lepidophyllus</h1>
<p>Osteocarpus lepidophyllus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of leafy liverwort that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky crevices or sandy soils. When dry, its leaves curl into a tight, bud-like structure, allowing it to survive extreme drought conditions. Upon rehydration, the plant rapidly unfolds, regaining its green, leafy appearance.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it an important example of extremophytic survival strategies in botanical studies.</p>
