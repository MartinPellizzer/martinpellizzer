<p>Ophrys × arachnitiformis subsp.</p>
<p>cilentana, commonly known as the Cilentan bee orchid, is a hybrid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like appearance that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and specialized pollination strategy.</p>
