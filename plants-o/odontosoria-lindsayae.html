                    <h1>Odontosoria lindsayae</h1>
<p>Odontosoria lindsayae, commonly known as Lindsay's tooth fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, tooth-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
