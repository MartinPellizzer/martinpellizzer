                            <h1>Orobanche Alba Var. Superba</h1>
<p>Orobanche alba var. superba is a rare and striking parasitic plant known for its pale white flowers and unique growth habits. Unlike most plants, it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. This variant is particularly notable for its larger size and more showy appearance compared to its common counterpart. It thrives in specific habitats, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its specialized needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
