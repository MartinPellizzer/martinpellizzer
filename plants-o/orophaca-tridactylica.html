                    <h1>Orophaca tridactylica</h1>
<p>Orophaca tridactylica, commonly known as the three-finger orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique morphology includes three prominent finger-like projections on the pseudobulb, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
