<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its specialized pollination strategy. The plant's flowers mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in specific habitats, such as calcareous soils in Mediterranean regions, and is often found in open, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
