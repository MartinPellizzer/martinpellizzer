                    <h1>Orobanche raddeana</h1>
<p>Orobanche raddeana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, usually white or yellow flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in cultivated environments.</p>
