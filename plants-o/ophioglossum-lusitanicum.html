                    <h1>Ophioglossum lusitanicum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, large, lance-shaped leaf that often resembles a tongue. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. Ophioglossum lusitanicum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
