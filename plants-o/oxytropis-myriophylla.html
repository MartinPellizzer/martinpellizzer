                    <h1>Oxytropis myriophylla</h1>
<p>Oxytropis myriophylla, commonly known as the many-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands, where it forms dense clumps. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
<p>Oxytropis myriophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
