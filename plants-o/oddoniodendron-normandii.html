                    <h1>Oddoniodendron normandii</h1>
<p>Oddoniodendron normandii, commonly known as the Normandy cypress, is a rare and unique coniferous plant native to France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, twisted, and often contorted growth pattern, which gives it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches, and it produces small, inconspicuous cones. It thrives in specific microclimates, often found in shaded, moist environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
