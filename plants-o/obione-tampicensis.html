<p>Obione tampicensis, commonly known as the Tampic Island orchid, is a rare endemic species found exclusively on the island of Tampico in Mexico.</p>
<p>This orchid is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has specialized aerial roots that absorb moisture from the air, adapting it to its unique ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under local conservation laws.</p>
