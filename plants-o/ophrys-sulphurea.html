<p>Ophrys sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.

It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Ophrys sulphurea is known for its specialized relationship with specific pollinators, particularly bees, which are attracted by the floral mimicry.</p>
