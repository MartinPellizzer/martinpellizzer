                    <h1>Orobanche sinensis var. cyanescens</h1>
<p>Orobanche sinensis var. cyanescens, commonly known as the blue Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Korea. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to blue in color, giving it its common name. It is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family, such as various legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
