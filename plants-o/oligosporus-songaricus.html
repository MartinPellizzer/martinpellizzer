<p>Oligosporus songaricus, commonly known as the Songaric spore plant, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
