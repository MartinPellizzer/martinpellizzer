                    <h1>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. gramineum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum vulgatum var. gramineum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a single, upright, leafless spore-bearing stalk that terminates in a broad, tongue-shaped fertile frond. The plant exhibits a primitive structure, with a short rhizome and a single, elongated sporophyll that bears spores on its underside. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its conservation status and is often considered a relict species with limited distribution.</p>
