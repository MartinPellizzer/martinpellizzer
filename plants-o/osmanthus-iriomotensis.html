<p>Osmanthus iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote osmanthus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Iriomote in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, fragrant flowers in the autumn, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is under threat from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
