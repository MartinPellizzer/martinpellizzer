                    <h1>Octomeris tuberculata</h1>
<p>Octomeris tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help it to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, adding to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through prey capture, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
