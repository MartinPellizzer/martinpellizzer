                    <h1>Oplismenus crus-galli</h1>
<p>Oplismenus crus-galli, commonly known as the "crane's-bill," is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the buckwheat family. Oplismenus crus-galli is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's common name is derived from its resemblance to the bill of a crane when viewed from above.</p>
