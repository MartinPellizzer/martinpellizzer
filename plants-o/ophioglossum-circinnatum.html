                    <h1>Ophioglossum circinnatum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum circinnatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species with a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a short, rhizomatous stem and a single, large, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two parts. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape, giving it its common name. It is a primitive fern with a simple morphology, lacking the complex fronds of more advanced ferns.</p>
<p>Ophioglossum circinnatum is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a relic species with limited distribution.</p>
