<p>Ornithidium breve, commonly known as the dwarf bird's nest, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Ornithidium breve is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining the biodiversity of forest understories.</p>
