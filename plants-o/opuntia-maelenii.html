                    <h1>Opuntia maelenii</h1>
<p>Opuntia maelenii, commonly known as the Maelen's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Pines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia maelenii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for survival in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
