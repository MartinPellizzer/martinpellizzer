<p>Oreoxis humilis, commonly known as the low oreoxis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Oreoxis humilis is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a resilient species in its native environment.</p>
