                    <h1>Ophrys dinarica</h1>
<p>Ophrys dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and shaded forest environments, thriving in moist, well-drained conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, greenish-yellow blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys dinarica is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
