                    <h1>Orobanche schultzii f. pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Orobanche schultzii f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It typically infests crops such as sunflowers and soybeans, causing significant yield losses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a serious weed in agricultural settings.</p>
