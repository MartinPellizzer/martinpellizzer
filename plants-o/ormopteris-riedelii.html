<p>Ormopteris riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Ormopteris riedelii plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
