<p>Ophrys × kreyiana, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their intricate mimicry of female insects. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. These flowers feature a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Ophrys × kreyiana is typically found in moist, calcareous soils across Europe, thriving in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
