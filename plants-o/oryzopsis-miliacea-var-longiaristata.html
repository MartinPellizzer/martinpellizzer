                    <h1>Oryzopsis miliacea var. longiaristata</h1>
<p>Oryzopsis miliacea var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-bracted milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces inflorescences that are typically spike-like with elongated bracts. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone soils. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
