                    <h1>Orobanche electra</h1>
<p>Orobanche electra, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants. The plant's roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of its hosts, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed habitats, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is notable due to its ability to weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
