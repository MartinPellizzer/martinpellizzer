                    <h1>Orestias</h1>
<p>Orestias, commonly known as the Andean shieldfish, is a genus of freshwater fish native to South America.</p>
<p>These fish are characterized by their unique, flattened bodies and specialized gill structures that allow them to thrive in high-altitude, oxygen-rich environments. Orestias species are often found in lakes and rivers at elevations above 3,000 meters, where they have adapted to cold, fast-flowing waters. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of aquatic biodiversity in Andean ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to their restricted habitats, many Orestias species are threatened by environmental changes and habitat degradation.</p>
