<p>Oleandra cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oleander, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, blooming in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its foliage and flowers.</p>
