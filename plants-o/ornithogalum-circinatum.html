<p>Ornithogalum circinatum, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that spiral around the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
