                    <h1>Orchis pratensis</h1>
<p>Orchis pratensis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, with a distinctive two-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>Orchis pratensis is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
