                    <h1>Onobrychis hemicycla</h1>
<p>Onobrychis hemicycla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces burr-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment.</p>
