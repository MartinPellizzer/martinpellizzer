                    <h1>Ornithogalum chrysanthum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum chrysanthum, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is part of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it.</p>
