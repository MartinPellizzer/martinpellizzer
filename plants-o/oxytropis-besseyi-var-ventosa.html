<p>Oxytropis besseyi var. ventosa, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
