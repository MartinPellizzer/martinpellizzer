                    <h1>Opuntia juniperina</h1>
<p>Opuntia juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper Opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its pads are edible when mature and have a slightly tart flavor, making them a food source for both wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>Opuntia juniperina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and nourishment to various desert species.</p>
