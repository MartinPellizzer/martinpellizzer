<p>Ononis repens subsp.</p>
<p>procurrens, commonly known as creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by tufts of fluffy, white seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry meadows, gravelly slopes, and along paths where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
