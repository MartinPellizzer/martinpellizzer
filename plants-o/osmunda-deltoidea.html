<p>Osmunda deltoidea, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, triangular fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a unique, shuttlecock-like shape, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Osmunda deltoidea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.</p>
