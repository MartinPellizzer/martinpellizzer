                            <h1>Ornithogalum Tenuifolium Subsp. Trichophyllum</h1>
<p>Ornithogalum tenuifolium subsp. trichophyllum is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family known for its elegant, star-shaped flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its common name, "star of wonder," reflects the beauty of its white blooms that appear in spring. The subspecies trichophyllum is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, setting it apart from other members of the species. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
