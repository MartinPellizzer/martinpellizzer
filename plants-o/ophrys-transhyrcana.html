                    <h1>Ophrys transhyrcana</h1>
<p>Ophrys transhyrcana, commonly known as the Trans-Hyrkanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained and nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys transhyrcana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
