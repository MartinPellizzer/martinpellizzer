                    <h1>Oberonia lindleyi</h1>
<p>Oberonia lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leafy growth and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the canopy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia lindleyi is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
