<p>Ozothamnus conditus, commonly known as the coastal daisy or silver daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 cm, with silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty sea air. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Ozothamnus conditus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
