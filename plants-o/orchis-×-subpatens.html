<p>Orchis × subpatens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in woodland habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species.</p>
