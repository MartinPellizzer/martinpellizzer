<p>Opuntia phaeacantha subsp.</p>
<p>mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically important plant in its native range.</p>
