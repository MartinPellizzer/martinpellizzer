<p>Ophrys × saratoi subsp.</p>
<p>benacensis, commonly known as the Benacense Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Italy and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
