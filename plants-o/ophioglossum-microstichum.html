                    <h1>Ophioglossum microstichum</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum microstichum, commonly known as the small-stitch fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect, bipinnate frond. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, linear arrangement along the frond's margins.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
