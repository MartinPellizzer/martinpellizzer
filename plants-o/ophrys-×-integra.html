                    <h1>Ophrys × integra</h1>
<p>Ophrys × integra, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, leading to a wide range of morphological variations.</p>
<p>Ophrys × integra thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
