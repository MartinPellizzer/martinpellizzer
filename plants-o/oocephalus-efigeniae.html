<p>Oocephalus efigeniae, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically red or pink in color, giving it a striking appearance in water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly.</p>
<p>Oocephalus efigeniae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water bodies.</p>
