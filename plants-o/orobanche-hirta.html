                    <h1>Orobanche hirta</h1>
<p>Orobanche hirta, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive hairy appearance on its stems and leaves. It typically parasitizes a range of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
