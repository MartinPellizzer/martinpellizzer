                    <h1>Oenanthe gymnorrhiza</h1>
<p>Oenanthe gymnorrhiza, commonly known as the mangrove arrowhead, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in muddy, brackish water conditions. The plant has a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize coastal sediments, making it ecologically significant in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oenanthe gymnorrhiza is often found in association with other mangrove species, contributing to the biodiversity of tidal wetlands.</p>
