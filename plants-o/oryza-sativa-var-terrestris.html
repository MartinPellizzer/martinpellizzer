                    <h1>Oryza sativa var. terrestris</h1>
<p>Oryza sativa var. terrestris, commonly known as the dwarf rice plant, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more commonly cultivated rice varieties. This plant typically produces small, grass-like leaves and has a short flowering period. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a spikelet structure typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>While not widely farmed, it is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
