<p>Oakesiella, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a genus of moss-like plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a simple thallus, which is a flattened, ribbon-like body made up of closely packed cells. Oakesiella species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, where they form dense mats.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
