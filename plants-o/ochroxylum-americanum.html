<p>Ochroxylum americanum, commonly known as American ochroium, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and sandy soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Ochroxylum americanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
