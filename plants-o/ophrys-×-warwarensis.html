                    <h1>Ophrys × warwarensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys × warwarensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure designed to mimic the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is native to southern Europe, including parts of Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
