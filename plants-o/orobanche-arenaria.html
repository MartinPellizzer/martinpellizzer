                    <h1>Orobanche arenaria</h1>
<p>Orobanche arenaria, commonly known as the sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, often within the Chenopodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
