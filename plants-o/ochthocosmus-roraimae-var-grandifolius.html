                    <h1>Ochthocosmus roraimae var. grandifolius</h1>
<p>Ochthocosmus roraimae var. grandifolius, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the high-altitude rock formations, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in the dry, nutrient-poor environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem.</p>
