<p>Oreomyrrhis planipetala, commonly known as the flat-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant features linear, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and are clustered in dense, spike-like racemes.</p>
<p>Oreomyrrhis planipetala is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
