                    <h1>Oxytropis submutica</h1>
<p>Oxytropis submutica, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Oxytropis submutica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
