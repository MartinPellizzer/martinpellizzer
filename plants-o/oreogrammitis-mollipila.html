<p>Oreogrammitis mollipila, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis mollipila is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with limited moisture.</p>
