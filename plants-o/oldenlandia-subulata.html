                    <h1>Oldenlandia subulata</h1>
<p>Oldenlandia subulata, commonly known as the slender leaf mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Oldenlandia subulata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
