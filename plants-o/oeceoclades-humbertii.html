<p>Oeceoclades humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, slender leaves and a compact inflorescence with numerous tiny, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
