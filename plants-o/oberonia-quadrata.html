                    <h1>Oberonia quadrata</h1>
<p>Oberonia quadrata, commonly known as the four-angled orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, four-angled stem and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oberonia quadrata is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse settings.</p>
