                    <h1>Oligosporus</h1>
<p>Oligosporus, commonly known as the common spore plant, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Sordariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact fruiting bodies that produce a large number of spores. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or damp soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing for wide geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Oligosporus plays a role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems through its decomposing activity.</p>
