                    <h1>Ornithidium loefgrenii</h1>
<p>Ornithidium loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's ornithidium, is a rare and specialized member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette structure and produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically green or red in color. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on epiphytic growth on tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
