                    <h1>Opuntia stellata</h1>
<p>Opuntia stellata, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Opuntia stellata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
