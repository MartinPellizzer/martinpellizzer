The plant thrives in specific habitats, such as calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it requires well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Its reproductive strategy involves a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its germination and growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
