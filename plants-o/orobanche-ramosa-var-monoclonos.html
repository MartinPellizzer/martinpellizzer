                    <h1>Orobanche ramosa var. monoclonos</h1>
<p>Orobanche ramosa var. monoclonos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a taproot and a flowering stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers, typically in clusters, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume family, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops.</p>
