<p>Oplismenus indicus, commonly known as the common stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, smooth stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine serrations along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs that release irritating chemicals, causing a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin.</p>
<p>Oplismenus indicus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
