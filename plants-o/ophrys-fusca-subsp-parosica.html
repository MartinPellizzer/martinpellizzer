<p>Ophrys fusca subsp.</p>
<p>parosica, commonly known as the Parosic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate markings that aid in mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
