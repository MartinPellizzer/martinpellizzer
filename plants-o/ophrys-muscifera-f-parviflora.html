                    <h1>Ophrys muscifera f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Ophrys muscifera f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other members of the Ophrys genus, with a pale yellow to greenish hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
