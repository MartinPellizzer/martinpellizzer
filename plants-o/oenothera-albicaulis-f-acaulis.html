                    <h1>Oenothera albicaulis f. acaulis</h1>
<p>Oenothera albicaulis f. acaulis, commonly known as the stalkless evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose species characterized by its absence of a distinct stem.</p>
<p>This plant typically features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. It is native to the southwestern United States and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
