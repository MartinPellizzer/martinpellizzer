<p>Orchis militaris subsp.</p>
<p>simia, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble the face of a monkey, with a prominent pouch-like structure called a labellum.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
