                    <h1>Opsopaea</h1>
<p>Opsopaea, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in areas with high water tables. The plant features a tall, slender stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment.</p>
<p>Opsopaea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
