                    <h1>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. serotina</h1>
<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs later in the season compared to other members of the Ophrys genus, usually from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
