                    <h1>Oerstedella caligaria</h1>
<p>Oerstedella caligaria, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Oerstedella caligaria is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
