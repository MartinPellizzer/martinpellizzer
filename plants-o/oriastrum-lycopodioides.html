                    <h1>Oriastrum lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Oriastrum lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, typical of the lycophyte life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine and hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed, acidic soil conditions.</p>
