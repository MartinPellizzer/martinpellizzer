                    <h1>Oxytropis chionobia</h1>
<p>Oxytropis chionobia, commonly known as the snowfield oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention and protection from extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Oxytropis chionobia plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and supports local pollinators.</p>
