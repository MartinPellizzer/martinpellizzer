                    <h1>Orobanche grayana var. typica</h1>
<p>Orobanche grayana var. typica, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with various grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a parasitic relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
