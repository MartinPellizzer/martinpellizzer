                    <h1>Oxytropis atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Oxytropis atropurpurea, commonly known as purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions and making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Oxytropis atropurpurea is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and as a forage plant for wildlife.</p>
