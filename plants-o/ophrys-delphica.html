                    <h1>Ophrys delphica</h1>
<p>Ophrys delphica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bee-shaped flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a prominent central lip that resembles a bee's body.</p>
<p>Ophrys delphica is a perennial herb that produces a single stem with several flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
