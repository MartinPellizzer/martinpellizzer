<p>Ophrys mammosa subsp.</p>
<p>mouterdeana, commonly known as the Mouterdean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
