<p>Onobrychis arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>tommasinii, commonly known as the sand sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
