                    <h1>Ophrys lutea var. quarteirae</h1>
<p>Ophrys lutea var. quarteirae, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers have a unique structure with a lip that resembles a bee's body, attracting male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
