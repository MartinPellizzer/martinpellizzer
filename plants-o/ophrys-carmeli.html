                    <h1>Ophrys carmeli</h1>
<p>Ophrys carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in spring, producing a single spike bearing a single, showy flower.</p>
<p>Ophrys carmeli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
