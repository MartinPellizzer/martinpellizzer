                            <h1>Oncostema Verna</h1>
<p>Spring onion, scientifically known as Oncostema verna, is a hardy herbaceous plant that thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly cultivated for its edible bulbs and leaves, which are prized for their mild, onion-like flavor. This plant typically grows in early spring, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking fresh produce in the cooler months. Its compact size and rapid growth make it ideal for small spaces and container gardening. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the common onion but shares similar culinary uses.</p>
