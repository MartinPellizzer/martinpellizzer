<p>Oreogrammitis murrayana, commonly known as the Murray's wall-rush, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has delicate, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It is often found in moist, cool habitats such as crevices in cliffs or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Oreogrammitis murrayana is a relatively rare species, with a limited distribution primarily in southeastern Australia.</p>
