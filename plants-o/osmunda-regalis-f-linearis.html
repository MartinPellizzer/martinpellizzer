                    <h1>Osmunda regalis f. linearis</h1>
<p>Osmunda regalis f. linearis, commonly known as the slender royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its narrower, more elongated fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to wetlands and moist forests in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a stout, underground rhizome with a crown of sterile fronds that are typically green and lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive fronds are fertile and bear spore-producing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, water-retentive environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance.</p>
