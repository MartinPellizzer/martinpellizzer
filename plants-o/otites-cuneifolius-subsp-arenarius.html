<p>Otites cuneifolius subsp.</p>
<p>arenarius, commonly known as the sand otite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>

<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
