<p>Ophrys sicula var. lepida, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
