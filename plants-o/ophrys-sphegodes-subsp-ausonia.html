<p>Ophrys sphegodes subsp.</p>
<p>ausonia, commonly known as the Ausonian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
