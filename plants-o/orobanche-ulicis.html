                    <h1>Orobanche ulicis</h1>
<p>Orobanche ulicis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized haustoria, which it uses to attach to and extract nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, where it parasitizes various grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops, making it a concern for farmers.</p>
