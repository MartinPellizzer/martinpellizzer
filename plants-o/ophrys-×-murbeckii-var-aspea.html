<p>Ophrys × murbeckii var. aspea, commonly known as the aspea bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings mimicking the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are specialized for insect pollination, particularly by bees, due to their intricate floral structures.</p>
<p>This varietal form is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in hybrid populations with other Ophrys species.</p>
