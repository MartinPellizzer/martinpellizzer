                    <h1>Orobanche rosmarina</h1>
<p>Orobanche rosmarina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with no true leaves. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, allowing it to establish a parasitic relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
