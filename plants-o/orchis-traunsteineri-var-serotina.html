                    <h1>Orchis traunsteineri var. serotina</h1>
<p>Orchis traunsteineri var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom later in the growing season. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its germination and growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
