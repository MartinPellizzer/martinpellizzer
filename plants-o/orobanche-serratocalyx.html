                    <h1>Orobanche serratocalyx</h1>
<p>Orobanche serratocalyx, commonly known as the serratedleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of leaves and stems, with only a taproot-like structure. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
