                    <h1>Ophrys × monachorum</h1>
<p>Ophrys × monachorum, commonly known as the monk's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The plant is characterized by its unique flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, each with a specialized labellum that enhances mimicry.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
