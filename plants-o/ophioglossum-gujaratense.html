                    <h1>Ophioglossum gujaratense</h1>
<p>Ophioglossum gujaratense, commonly known as the Gujarat adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a sporophyll. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the sporophyll.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
