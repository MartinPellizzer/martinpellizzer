                    <h1>Ophrys vanbruggeniana</h1>
<p>Ophrys vanbruggeniana, commonly known as the Van Bruggen's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps, a trait known as pseudocopulation, aiding in pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
