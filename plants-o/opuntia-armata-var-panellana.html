<p>Opuntia armata var. panellana, commonly known as the Panellenan prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine.</p>
