                    <h1>Oxydectes semivestita</h1>
<p>Oxydectes semivestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed agricultural fields.</p>
