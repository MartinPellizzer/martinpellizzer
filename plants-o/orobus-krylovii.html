<p>Orobus krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods containing small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal in harsh environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
<p>Orobus krylovii plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for ecological restoration projects.</p>
