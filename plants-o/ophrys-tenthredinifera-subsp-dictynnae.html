<p>Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp.</p>
<p>dictynnae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in sunny meadows or woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.</p>
<p>The subspecies dictynnae is distinguished by subtle differences in flower morphology and habitat preference compared to other subspecies of Ophrys tenthredinifera.</p>
