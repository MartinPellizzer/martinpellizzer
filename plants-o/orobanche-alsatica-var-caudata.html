                    <h1>Orobanche alsatica var. caudata</h1>
<p>Orobanche alsatica var. caudata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
