                    <h1>Orobanche versicolor</h1>
<p>Orobanche versicolor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on crops like wheat and barley. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in agricultural crops.</p>
