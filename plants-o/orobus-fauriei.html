                    <h1>Orobus fauriei</h1>
<p>Orobus fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. It is native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
