                    <h1>Ophrys icariensis</h1>
<p>Ophrys icariensis, commonly known as the Icarus bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
