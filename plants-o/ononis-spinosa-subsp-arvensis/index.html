<p>Ononis spinosa subsp. arvensis is a hardy plant commonly found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas. Despite its common presence, it plays an important role in soil stabilization and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
