                    <h1>Opuntia araucana</h1>
<p>Opuntia araucana, commonly known as the Andean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia araucana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional cultures in its native range.</p>
