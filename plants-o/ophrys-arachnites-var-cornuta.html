                    <h1>Ophrys arachnites var. cornuta</h1>
<p>Ophrys arachnites var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
