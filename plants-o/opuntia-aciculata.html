<p>Opuntia aciculata, commonly known as the needle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its pads can be eaten when fully mature, though they contain a mild, slightly sour taste.</p>
<p>Opuntia aciculata plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
