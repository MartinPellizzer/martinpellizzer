                    <h1>Oberonia crateriformis</h1>
<p>Oberonia crateriformis, commonly known as the crater-shaped orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid characterized by its distinctive, cup-like flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single, clustered inflorescence. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia crateriformis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
