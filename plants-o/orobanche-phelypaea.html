                    <h1>Orobanche phelypaea</h1>
<p>Orobanche phelypaea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. It is found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often in disturbed soils or agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
