The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces woody capsules that contain small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
