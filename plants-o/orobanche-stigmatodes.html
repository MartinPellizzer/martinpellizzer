                    <h1>Orobanche stigmatodes</h1>
<p>Orobanche stigmatodes, commonly known as the spotted broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish stem with distinctive spots. This species typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
