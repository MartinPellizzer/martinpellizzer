                    <h1>Oncidium desertorum</h1>
<p>Oncidium desertorum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters of 3 to 8 blooms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Oncidium desertorum is prized for its resilience and ornamental value in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
