<p>Ottelia scabra, commonly known as the rough water plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions.</p>
<p>Ottelia scabra is also noted for its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
