                    <h1>Orobanche knappii</h1>
<p>Orobanche knappii, commonly known as the Knapp's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, tubular structure that facilitates pollination by insects. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecological niche.</p>
