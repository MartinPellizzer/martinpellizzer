<p>Ophrys × arachnitiformis f. nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, bee-like flower with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant is native to the Balkan region and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its floral morphology mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>This rare and specialized orchid is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations.</p>
