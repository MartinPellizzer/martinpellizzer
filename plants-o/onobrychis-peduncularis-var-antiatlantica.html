                    <h1>Onobrychis peduncularis var. antiatlantica</h1>
<p>Onobrychis peduncularis var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bursaria, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological resilience and potential for use in coastal restoration projects.</p>
