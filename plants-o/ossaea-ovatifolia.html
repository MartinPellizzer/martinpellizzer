                    <h1>Ossaea ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Ossaea ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in spring. Ossaea ovatifolia is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
