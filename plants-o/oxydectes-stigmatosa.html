The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Oxydectes stigmatosa is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
