                    <h1>Odontites rotundatus</h1>
<p>Odontites rotundatus, commonly known as the round-leaved toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
