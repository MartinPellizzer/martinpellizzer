<p>Orobanche major subsp.</p>
<p>santolinae, commonly known as the Santolina dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its dependence on host plants for survival.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. It typically infests plants in the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and ragworts.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
