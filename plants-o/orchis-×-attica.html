                    <h1>Orchis × attica</h1>
<p>Orchis × attica, commonly known as the Greek orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in regions of southern and central Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis × attica exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species.</p>
