                    <h1>Oxytropis strobilacea var. sublanata</h1>
<p>Oxytropis strobilacea var. sublanata, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soils and support native wildlife.</p>
