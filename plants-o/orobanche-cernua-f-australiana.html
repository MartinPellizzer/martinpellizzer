                    <h1>Orobanche cernua f. australiana</h1>
<p>Orobanche cernua f. australiana, commonly known as the Australian common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and typically infests plants such as wheat, barley, and various grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host's roots and establishing a parasitic connection.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in agricultural crops.</p>
