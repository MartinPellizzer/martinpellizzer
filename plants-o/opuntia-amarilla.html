                    <h1>Opuntia amarilla</h1>
<p>Opuntia amarilla, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp, barbed spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Opuntia amarilla is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and animals.</p>
