The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
