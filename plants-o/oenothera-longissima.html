<p>Oenothera longissima, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Oenothera longissima is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the high concentration of essential fatty acids in its seeds.</p>
