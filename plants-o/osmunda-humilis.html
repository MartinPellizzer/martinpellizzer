                    <h1>Osmunda humilis</h1>
<p>Osmunda humilis, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive morphology, with a short, creeping rhizome and feather-like fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Osmunda humilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water margins.</p>
