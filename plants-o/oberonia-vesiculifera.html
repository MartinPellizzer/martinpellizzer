                    <h1>Oberonia vesiculifera</h1>
<p>Oberonia vesiculifera, commonly known as the bubble orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that resemble small bubbles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia vesiculifera is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
