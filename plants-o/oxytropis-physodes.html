                    <h1>Oxytropis physodes</h1>
<p>Oxytropis physodes, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and it produces lens-shaped, brown pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis physodes is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
