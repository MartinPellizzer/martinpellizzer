                    <h1>Obione thornberi</h1>
<p>Obione thornberi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its deep root system. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Obione thornberi plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
