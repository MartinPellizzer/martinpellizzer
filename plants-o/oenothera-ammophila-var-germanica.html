<p>Oenothera ammophila var. germanica, commonly known as the German sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
