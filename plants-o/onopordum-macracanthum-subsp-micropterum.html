<p>Onopordum macracanthum subsp.</p>
<p>micropterum, commonly known as the small-winged thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The subspecies micropterum is distinguished by its smaller wing-like structures on the bracts compared to the typical form.</p>
