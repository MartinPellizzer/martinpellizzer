                    <h1>Operculicarya borealis</h1>
<p>Operculicarya borealis, commonly known as the northern operculicarya, is a rare and cold-adapted plant species native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for climate change impacts in polar regions.</p>
