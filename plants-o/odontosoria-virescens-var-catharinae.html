                    <h1>Odontosoria virescens var. catharinae</h1>
<p>Odontosoria virescens var. catharinae, commonly known as the Catharina's water fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a subtle bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
