The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
