                    <h1>Dipcadi kelleri</h1>
<p>Dipcadi kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is typically found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
