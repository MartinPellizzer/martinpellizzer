<p>Diplopappus poeppigianus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in dry environments with deep taproots and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient species in harsh, semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
