                    <h1>Disa welwitschii var. occultans</h1>
<p>Disa welwitschii var. occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>This rare and enigmatic plant is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
