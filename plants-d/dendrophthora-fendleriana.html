                    <h1>Dendrophthora fendleriana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
