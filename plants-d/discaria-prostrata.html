                <h1>Discaria prostrata</h1>
<p>Discaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate discaria, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Discaria prostrata is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
