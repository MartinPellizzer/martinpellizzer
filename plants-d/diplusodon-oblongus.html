<p>Diplusodon oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, purple or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Diplusodon oblongus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
