                    <h1>Drosera × hybrida</h1>
<p>Drosera × hybrida, commonly known as the sundew hybrid, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the Droseraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera rotundifolia, combining traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap insects. It typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptive carnivorous behavior make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
