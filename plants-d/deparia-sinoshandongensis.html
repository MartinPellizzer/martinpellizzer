<p>Deparia sinoshandongensis, commonly known as the Shandong wood fern, is a rare species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, humus-filled soils. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
