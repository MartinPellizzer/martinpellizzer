<p>Diplazium marginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a unique, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a serrated margin, which contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Diplazium marginatum is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden environments.</p>
