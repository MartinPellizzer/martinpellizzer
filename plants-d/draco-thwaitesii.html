                    <h1>Draco thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Draco thwaitesii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, spongy tissue. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring a humid, shaded environment with a stable temperature range.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, Draco thwaitesii is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
