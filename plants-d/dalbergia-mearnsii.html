                    <h1>Dalbergia mearnsii</h1>
<p>Dalbergia mearnsii, commonly known as ironwood or blackwood, is a leguminous tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often used in furniture and musical instruments due to its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
