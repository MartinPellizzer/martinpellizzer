                    <h1>Dalea roseiflora</h1>
<p>Dalea roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs and produces clusters of delicate, pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Dalea roseiflora is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
