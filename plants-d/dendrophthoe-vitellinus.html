                    <h1>Dendrophthoe vitellinus</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe vitellinus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, tangled mass of stems and leaves that can significantly weaken the host tree over time. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its small, yellowish-white flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
