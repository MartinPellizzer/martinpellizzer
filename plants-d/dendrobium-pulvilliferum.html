                    <h1>Dendrobium pulvilliferum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium pulvilliferum, commonly known as the hairy-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clustered, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with red or orange markings. Its leaves are broad and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
