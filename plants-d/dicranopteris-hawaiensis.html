<p>Dicranopteris hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris hawaiensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of freshwater ecosystems in Hawaii.</p>
