                    <h1>Diplazium latifrons</h1>
<p>Diplazium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are divided into segments, with the upper fronds often being more robust and resembling the shape of a stag's antlers.</p>
<p>Diplazium latifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
