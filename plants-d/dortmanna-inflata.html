<p>Dortmanna inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Dortmanna inflata is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
