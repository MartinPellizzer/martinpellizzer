<p>Diothonea heterothonaea, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Diothonea heterothonaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
