                    <h1>Duranta repens f. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Duranta repens f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf duranta, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features oval, glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Duranta repens, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature, often followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for container gardening or as a landscape accent.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
