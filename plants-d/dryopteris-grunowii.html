                    <h1>Dryopteris grunowii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris grunowii, commonly known as the Grunow's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
