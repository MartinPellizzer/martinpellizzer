<p>Digitacalia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas digitaria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is adapted to high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Digitacalia chiapensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
