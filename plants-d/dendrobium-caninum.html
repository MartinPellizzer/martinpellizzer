                    <h1>Dendrobium caninum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium caninum, commonly known as the dog orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its stems are pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrobium caninum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
