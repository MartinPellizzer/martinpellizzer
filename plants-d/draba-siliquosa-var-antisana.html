                    <h1>Draba siliquosa var. antisana</h1>
<p>Draba siliquosa var. antisana, commonly known as the Antisana whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which is characterized by its cruciform flowers and silique fruits.</p>
