                    <h1>Dasylirion wheeleri var. durangense</h1>
<p>Dasylirion wheeleri var. durangense, commonly known as the Durango sotol, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray, sword-shaped leaves that are often lined with white or silver hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other sotol species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
