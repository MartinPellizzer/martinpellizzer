<p>Dendrobium johannis, commonly known as the John's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Dendrobium johannis thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
