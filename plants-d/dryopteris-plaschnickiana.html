<p>Dryopteris plaschnickiana, commonly known as the Plaschnick's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia that are clustered in sori.</p>
