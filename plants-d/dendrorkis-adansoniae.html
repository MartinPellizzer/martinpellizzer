<p>Dendrorkis adansoniae, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking tropical tree native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, white flowers and long, woody pods that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are palmate, with multiple leaflets, and it can grow to impressive heights, sometimes exceeding 20 meters.</p>
<p>The baobab is also known for its ecological and cultural significance in many regions.</p>
