<p>Draba chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba chamissonis produces small white or pale yellow flowers from late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings.</p>
