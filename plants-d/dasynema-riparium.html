<p>Dasynema riparium, commonly known as the riverbank liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and damp soil. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
