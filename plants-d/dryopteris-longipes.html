                    <h1>Dryopteris longipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, and are often adorned with fine, elongated pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
