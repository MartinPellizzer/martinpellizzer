<p>Disa welwitschii subsp.</p>
<p>occultans, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name.</p>

<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
