The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium aries is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
