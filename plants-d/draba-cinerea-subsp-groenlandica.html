<p>Draba cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sandflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of Greenland and northern Scandinavia. It typically forms a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and flowering time are closely tied to the short growing season of its native habitat.</p>
