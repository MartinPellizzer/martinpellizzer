<p>Dactylis polygama f. laxa, commonly known as the loose-stemmed cat's ear, is a variant of the cat's ear grass species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often mistaken for dandelion flowers. Its loose, sprawling growth habit allows it to spread easily in grasslands and meadows.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
