                    <h1>Dicranopteris rufinervis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically light green with prominent, reddish veins. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
