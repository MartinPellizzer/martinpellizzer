                    <h1>Dracaena perrottetii var. minor</h1>
<p>Dracaena perrottetii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, slow-growing plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and compact size, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and small spaces.</p>
