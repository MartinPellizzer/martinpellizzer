<p>Dimeria ciliata, commonly known as the silky dimeria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, ciliate (fringed) leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment.

<p>Dimeria ciliata is often found growing on rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
