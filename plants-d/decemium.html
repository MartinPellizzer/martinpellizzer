                    <h1>Decemium</h1>
<p>Decemium, commonly known as the ten-leaf plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>It features ten broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unusual structure and limited distribution, the decemium is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its genetic and ecological significance.</p>
