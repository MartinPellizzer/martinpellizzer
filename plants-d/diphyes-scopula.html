                    <h1>Diphyes scopula</h1>
<p>Diphyes scopula, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
