<p>Dendrobium fuligineum, commonly known as the sooty orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a dark, sooty appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium fuligineum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
