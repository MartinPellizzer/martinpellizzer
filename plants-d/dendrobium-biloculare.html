                    <h1>Dendrobium biloculare</h1>
<p>Dendrobium biloculare, commonly known as the two-chambered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive two-lobed lip that gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium biloculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
