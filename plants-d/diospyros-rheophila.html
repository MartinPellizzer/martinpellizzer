<p>Diospyros rheophila, commonly known as the stream diospyros, is a rare tropical tree species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-orange fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and is adapted to high humidity and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
