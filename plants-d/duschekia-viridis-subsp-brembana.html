<p>Duschekia viridis subsp.</p>
<p>brembana, commonly known as the Bremban green bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped green flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
