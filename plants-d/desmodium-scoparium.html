                    <h1>Desmodium scoparium</h1>
<p>Desmodium scoparium, commonly known as smallleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Desmodium scoparium is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
