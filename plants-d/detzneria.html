                    <h1>Detzneria</h1>
<p>Detzneria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its unique growth habit, often appearing as a cluster of small, ephemeral blooms that open only under specific environmental conditions. Detzneria is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its purported healing abilities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
