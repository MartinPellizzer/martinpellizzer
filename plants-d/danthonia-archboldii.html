<p>Danthonia archboldii, commonly known as the Florida wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, particularly in pine flatwoods and marshes, and is adapted to periodic flooding. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Danthonia archboldii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
