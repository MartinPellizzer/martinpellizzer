                    <h1>Dupatya macrocephala</h1>
<p>Dupatya macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed spider orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a single, large, showy flower with a prominent, spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shady, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of wasps, which are attracted to the plant's scent and color.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its specialized morphology and ecological interactions, making it an important subject in studies of plant-insect relationships.</p>
