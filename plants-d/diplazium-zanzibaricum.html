<p>Diplazium zanzibaricum, commonly known as Zanzibar water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Diplazium zanzibaricum plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats.</p>
