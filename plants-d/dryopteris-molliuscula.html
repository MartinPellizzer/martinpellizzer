<p>Dryopteris molliuscula, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish to brownish coating, known as trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
