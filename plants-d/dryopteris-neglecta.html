                    <h1>Dryopteris neglecta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris neglecta, commonly known as the neglected wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with dark brown, wiry roots and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often folded when young. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, fern-like appearance.</p>
