<p>Dryopteris ochropteroides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with golden or bronze-colored veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest understory.</p>
