<p>Dendrobium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinctive orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
