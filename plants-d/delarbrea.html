                    <h1>Delarbrea</h1>
<p>Delarbrea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, white or pink flowers. Delarbrea species are often valued for their durable, dark-colored wood, which has been used historically in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, many species are now endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
