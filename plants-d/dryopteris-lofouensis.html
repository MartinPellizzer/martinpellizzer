<p>Dryopteris lofouensis, commonly known as the Lofouense wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive pinnae structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
