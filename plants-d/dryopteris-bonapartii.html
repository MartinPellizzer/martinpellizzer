                    <h1>Dryopteris bonapartii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
