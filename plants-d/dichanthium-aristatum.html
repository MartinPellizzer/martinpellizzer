                    <h1>Dichanthium aristatum</h1>
<p>Dichanthium aristatum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two to three bracts, which are typically adorned with short, stiff hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Dichanthium aristatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage in some regions due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
