                    <h1>Dortmanna humifusa</h1>
<p>Dortmanna humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by heart-shaped, edible leaves. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a seasoning due to their tangy, sour flavor.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
