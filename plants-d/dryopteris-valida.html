<p>Dryopteris valida, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that often display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically deciduous, with the sterile fronds withering in late summer while the fertile ones persist through the winter.</p>
