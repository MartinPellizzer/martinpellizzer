                    <h1>Draba alpina var. algida</h1>
<p>Draba alpina var. algida, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine tundra, often surviving harsh winters due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Draba species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits.</p>
