<p>Dioon oaxacensis, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, spiky cones, with the male cones typically appearing first followed by the female cones. Dioon oaxacensis is known for its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary history dating back millions of years.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
