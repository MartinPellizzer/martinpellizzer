                    <h1>Dendrobium pungentifolium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium pungentifolium, commonly known as the spiny-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and horticultural appeal, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts.</p>
