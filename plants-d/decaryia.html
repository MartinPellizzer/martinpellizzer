                    <h1>Decaryia</h1>
<p>Decaryia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical Africa and are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers. Decaryia species typically produce vibrant blooms in shades of purple, pink, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are often velvety and thick, adapted to retain moisture in their native arid environments.</p>
<p>Decaryia plants are popular houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
