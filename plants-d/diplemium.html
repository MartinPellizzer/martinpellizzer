                    <h1>Diplemium</h1>
<p>Diplemium, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette or clustered form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplemium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats.</p>
