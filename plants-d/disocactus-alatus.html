                    <h1>Disocactus alatus</h1>
<p>Disocactus alatus, commonly known as the bat's wing cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that resemble bat wings, which are often covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
