<p>Daemonorops urdanetana, commonly known as the Urdaneta palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon, where it thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, yellowish-white inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daemonorops urdanetana is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
