<p>Dalbergia suaresensis, commonly known as the Suarez rosewood, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink.
