                    <h1>Dendrophthora podocarpicola</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora podocarpicola, commonly known as the podocarp tree mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily infests podocarp species.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host through a specialized structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating bird-mediated dispersal. It is native to New Zealand and is typically found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
