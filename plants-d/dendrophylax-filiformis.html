                    <h1>Dendrophylax filiformis</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax filiformis, commonly known as the slender pineapple orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
