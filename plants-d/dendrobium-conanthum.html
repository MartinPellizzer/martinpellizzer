                    <h1>Dendrobium conanthum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium conanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrobium conanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
