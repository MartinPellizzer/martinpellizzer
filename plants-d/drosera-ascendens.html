<p>Drosera ascendens, commonly known as the ascending sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and rosettes of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to attract prey. Drosera ascendens typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It is a perennial species that produces small, white flowers during the summer months.</p>
