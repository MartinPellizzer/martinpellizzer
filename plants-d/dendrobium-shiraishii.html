                    <h1>Dendrobium shiraishii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium shiraishii, commonly known as the Shiraishi dendrobium, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
