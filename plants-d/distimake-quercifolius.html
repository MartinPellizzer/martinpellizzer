                    <h1>Distimake quercifolius</h1>
<p>Distimake quercifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf shade tree, is a deciduous plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of the oak, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for urban landscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
