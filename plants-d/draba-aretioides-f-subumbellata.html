                    <h1>Draba aretioides f. subumbellata</h1>
<p>Draba aretioides f. subumbellata, commonly known as the alpine wintercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its ability to survive harsh climates and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptability.</p>
