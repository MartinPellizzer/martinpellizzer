                    <h1>Dryopteris trianae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris trianae, commonly known as the Trianza shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
