<p>Dryopteris discophora, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore release.</p>
