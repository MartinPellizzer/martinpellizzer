                    <h1>Dictyoxiphium michlerianum</h1>
<p>Dictyoxiphium michlerianum, commonly known as the Michler's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces a unique, fragrant odor reminiscent of vanilla.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
