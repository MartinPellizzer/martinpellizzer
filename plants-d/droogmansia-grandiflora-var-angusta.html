                    <h1>Droogmansia grandiflora var. angusta</h1>
<p>Droogmansia grandiflora var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed droogmansia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting bracts that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, followed by a short-lived inflorescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions.</p>
