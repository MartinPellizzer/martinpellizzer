                    <h1>Dryopteris × dowellii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × dowellii, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette form, often with a pale green or bluish hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden.</p>
