                    <h1>Delphinium tenuisectum</h1>
<p>Delphinium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens where children or pets are present.</p>
