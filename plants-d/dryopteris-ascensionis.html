<p>Dryopteris ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its unique adaptations to its isolated island habitat, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
