<p>Dudleya anomala, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.
