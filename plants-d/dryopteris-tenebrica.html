                    <h1>Dryopteris tenebrica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris tenebrica, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant features fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
