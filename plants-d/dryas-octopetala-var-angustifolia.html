                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain avens, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly hardy, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates.</p>
