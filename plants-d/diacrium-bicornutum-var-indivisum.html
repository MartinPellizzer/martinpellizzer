                    <h1>Diacrium bicornutum var. indivisum</h1>
<p>Diacrium bicornutum var. indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diacrium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to high-altitude environments, with a compact growth form and dense foliage to reduce wind exposure. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with flowers that rely on specific pollinators for fertilization.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments.</p>
