                    <h1>Diplazium subsinuatum var. rheophilum</h1>
<p>Diplazium subsinuatum var. rheophilum, commonly known as the water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that provide a dense, lush appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in slow-moving freshwater systems and is valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens.</p>
