                            <h1>Dendrolobium Ursinum</h1>
<p>Dendrolobium ursinum is a striking legume native to southern Africa known for its vibrant red flowers and unique leaf structure. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats. Its name, meaning "bear's claw," refers to the distinctive shape of its seed pods. Despite its beauty, it is also considered a noxious weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical study for its ecological and medicinal potential.</p>
