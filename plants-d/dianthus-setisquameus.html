<p>Dianthus setisquameus, commonly known as the sand dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its flowers are typically surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Dianthus setisquameus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
