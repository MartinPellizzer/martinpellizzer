<p>[WRONG START] Dendrobium h Hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, erect pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow lip that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium hancockii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation.</p>
