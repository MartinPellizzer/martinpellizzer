                    <h1>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. hoeppneri</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. hoeppneri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to peat bogs in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
