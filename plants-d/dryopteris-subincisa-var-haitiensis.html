                    <h1>Dryopteris subincisa var. haitiensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subincisa var. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian holly fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
