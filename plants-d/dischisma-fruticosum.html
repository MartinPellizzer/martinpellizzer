<p>Dischisma fruticosum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are yellow and appear in spring, followed by a crown of bracts that resemble a dandelion's puffball.</p>
<p>Dischisma fruticosum is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
