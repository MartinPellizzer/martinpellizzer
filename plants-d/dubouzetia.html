                    <h1>Dubouzetia</h1>
<p>Dubouzetia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plants are characterized by their large, showy spathes that enclose a spadix bearing small, greenish flowers. Dubouzetia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>They have a long history of use in traditional medicine, though they are toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
