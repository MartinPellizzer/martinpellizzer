                    <h1>Davallia divergens</h1>
<p>Davallia divergens, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, delicate appearance with a zigzag pattern along the veins. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
