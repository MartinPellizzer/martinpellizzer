<p>Diplazium metcalfii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>Diplazium metcalfii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
