<p>It features small, dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
