<p>Dryopteris leucolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of trichomes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
