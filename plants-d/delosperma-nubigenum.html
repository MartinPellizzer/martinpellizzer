<p>Delosperma nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-spreading ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Delosperma nubigenum is also known for its ability to produce offsets, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
