                    <h1>Dryopteris kingii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris kingii, commonly known as the King fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
