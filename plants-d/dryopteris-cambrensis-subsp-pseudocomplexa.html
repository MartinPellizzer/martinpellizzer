<p>Dryopteris cambrensis subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocomplexa, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a fern species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its genetic and morphological variation, which contributes to its classification within the broader Dryopteris cambrensis species complex.</p>
