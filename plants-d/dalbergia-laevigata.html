                    <h1>Dalbergia laevigata</h1>
<p>Dalbergia laevigata, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish bark, which is often deeply furrowed and cracked. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color, fine grain, and aromatic qualities, making it popular in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>
