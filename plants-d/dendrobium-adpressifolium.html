<p>Dendrobium adpressifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its leaves are flat and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium adpressifolium blooms with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months.</p>
