                    <h1>Draba fladnizensis f. lactea</h1>
<p>Draba fladnizensis f. lactea, commonly known as the white-flowered rockcress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is usually covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
