                    <h1>Dryopteris × sjoegrenii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × sjoegrenii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
