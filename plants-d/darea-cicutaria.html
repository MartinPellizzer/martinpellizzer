                    <h1>Darea cicutaria</h1>
<p>Darea cicutaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize moist environments effectively.</p>
<p>Darea cicutaria plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
