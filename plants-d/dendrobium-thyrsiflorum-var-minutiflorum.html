<p>Dendrobium thyrsiflorum var. minutiflorum, commonly known as the miniature thyrso-flowered orchid, is a sympodial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with numerous small, clustered pseudobulbs that produce delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a container plant.</p>
