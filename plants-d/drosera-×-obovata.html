<p>Drosera × obovata, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera rotundifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects for nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, thriving in regions with high humidity and acidic soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often pink or red, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and carnivorous behavior.</p>
