                    <h1>Dyckia heloisae</h1>
<p>Dyckia heloisae, commonly known as the Heloise Dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, fibrous material. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they form a tight cluster that helps retain moisture. It produces striking, red-brown flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often grown as an ornamental in collections of bromeliads.</p>
