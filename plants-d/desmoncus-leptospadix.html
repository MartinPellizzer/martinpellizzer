The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
