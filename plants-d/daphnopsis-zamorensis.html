                    <h1>Daphnopsis zamorensis</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora daphnopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and striking, colorful bracts. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daphnopsis zamorensis is considered a conservation concern and is rarely found in cultivation.</p>
