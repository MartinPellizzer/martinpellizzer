<p>Diploclinium racemosum, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Diploclinium racemosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
