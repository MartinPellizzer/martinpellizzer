                    <h1>Dolichostachys</h1>
<p>Dolichostachys, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow leaves, often growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Dolichostachys species typically produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. They are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making them common in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>
