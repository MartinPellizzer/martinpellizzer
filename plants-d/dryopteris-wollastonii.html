<p>Dryopteris wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they emerge from a short, dark rhizome.

<p>Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
