                    <h1>Dilochia deleoniae</h1>
<p>Dilochia deleoniae, commonly known as the noble flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilochia deleoniae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
