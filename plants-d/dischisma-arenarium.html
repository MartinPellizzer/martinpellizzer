<p>Dischisma arenarium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in arid and sandy environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dischisma arenarium is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
