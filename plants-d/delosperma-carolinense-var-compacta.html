                    <h1>Delosperma carolinense var. compacta</h1>
<p>Delosperma carolinense var. compacta, commonly known as the Carolina iceplant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-maintain ornamental plant.</p>
