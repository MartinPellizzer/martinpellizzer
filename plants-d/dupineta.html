                    <h1>Dupineta</h1>
<p>Dupineta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Dupineta is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
