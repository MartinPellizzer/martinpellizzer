<p>Diasperus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Diasperus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly curled. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in rocky soils and is relatively uncommon in cultivation.</p>
