                    <h1>Dryopteris jiucaipingensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris jiucaipingensis, commonly known as the Jiucaiping fern, is a rare species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
