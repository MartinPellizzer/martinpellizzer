                    <h1>Demosthenesia oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Demosthenesia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leafed demosthenes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
