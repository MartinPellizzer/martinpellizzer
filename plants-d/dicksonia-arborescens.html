<p>Dicksonia arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a large, upright fern native to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a thick, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that resembles bark. The plant has a crown of large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Dicksonia arborescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
