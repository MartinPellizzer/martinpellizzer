<p>Davallia vogelii, commonly known as the fern moss or velvet fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.

It produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season.</p>
<p>Davallia vogelii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
