                    <h1>Delphinium speciosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium speciosum, commonly known as the showy larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the Delphinium genus. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is toxic to both humans and animals.</p>
