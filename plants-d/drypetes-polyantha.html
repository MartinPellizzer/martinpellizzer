<p>Drypetes polyantha, commonly known as the red sanders or red ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by orange-red fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
