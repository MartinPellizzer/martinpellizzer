                    <h1>Delissea coriacea var. degeneriana</h1>
<p>Delissea coriacea var. degeneriana, commonly known as the rough-leaved delissea, is a rare and unusual member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
