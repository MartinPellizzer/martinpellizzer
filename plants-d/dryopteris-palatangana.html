                    <h1>Dryopteris palatangana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris palatangana, commonly known as the Palatangana wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or lobed margin, and the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings.</p>
