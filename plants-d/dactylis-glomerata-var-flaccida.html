                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. flaccida, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, pale green to silver-gray florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green color, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>The variety flaccida is distinguished by its more floccose (fluffy) appearance compared to the typical form of Dactylis glomerata.</p>
