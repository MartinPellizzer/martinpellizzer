<p>Daphniphyllum gracile var. newirelandum, commonly known as the New Ireland holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of New Ireland in Papua New Guinea.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
