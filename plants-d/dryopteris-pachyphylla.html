                    <h1>Dryopteris pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
