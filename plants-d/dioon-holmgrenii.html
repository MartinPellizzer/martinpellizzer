                    <h1>Dioon holmgrenii</h1>
<p>Dioon holmgrenii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cycad native to the southern United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
