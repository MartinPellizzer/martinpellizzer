                    <h1>Dovea ebracteata</h1>
<p>Dovea ebracteata, commonly known as the leafless dovea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to related species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dovea ebracteata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
