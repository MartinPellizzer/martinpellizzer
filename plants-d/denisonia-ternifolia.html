                    <h1>Denisonia ternifolia</h1>
<p>Denisonia ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom on slender stalks above the water surface. The plant has waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the water's surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native aquatic plants.</p>
