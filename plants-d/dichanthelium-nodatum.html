<p>Dichanthelium nodatum, commonly known as the nodular dichanthelium, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per stem. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Dichanthelium nodatum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
