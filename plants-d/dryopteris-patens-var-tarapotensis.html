                    <h1>Dryopteris patens var. tarapotensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris patens var. tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapoto holly fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
