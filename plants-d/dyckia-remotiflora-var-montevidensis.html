<p>Dyckia remotiflora var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense Dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to Uruguay.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences of red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions.</p>
