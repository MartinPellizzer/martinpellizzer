                    <h1>Dryopteris supraspinigera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris supraspinigera, commonly known as the purple shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are often curled when young.</p>
