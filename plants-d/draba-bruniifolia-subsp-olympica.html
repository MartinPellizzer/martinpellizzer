<p>Draba bruniifolia subsp.</p>
<p>olympica, commonly known as the Olympic Draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly adapted to the cool, humid conditions of the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
