<p>Dryopteris cyclopeltidiformis, commonly known as the cyclopeltidiform fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided and have a distinctive, almost circular shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and remain lush throughout the year, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens.</p>
