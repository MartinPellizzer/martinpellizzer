                    <h1>Dryopteris intermedia var. mannii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris intermedia var. mannii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and enable it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name.</p>
