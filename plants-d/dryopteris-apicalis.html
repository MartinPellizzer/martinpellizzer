                    <h1>Dryopteris apicalis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris apicalis, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, with the uppermost pinnae being the most elongated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
