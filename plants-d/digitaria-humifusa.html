                    <h1>Digitaria humifusa</h1>
<p>Digitaria humifusa, commonly known as flatleaf barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and other low-lying areas. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It is an important weed in agricultural systems, particularly in rice cultivation.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and competitive species in its habitat.</p>
