<p>Diospyros austroafricana subsp.</p>
<p>rugosa, commonly known as the rough-skinned ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often pubescent underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, edible fruits that are typically black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The subspecies is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins.</p>
