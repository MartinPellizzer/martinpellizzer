                    <h1>Diasperus lacunarius</h1>
<p>Diasperus lacunarius, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>Diasperus lacunarius plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
