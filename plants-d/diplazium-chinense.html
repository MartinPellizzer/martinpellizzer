                    <h1>Diplazium chinense</h1>
<p>Diplazium chinense, commonly known as Chinese chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of fronds—sterile and fertile—on the same plant. The sterile fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape, while the fertile fronds bear spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
