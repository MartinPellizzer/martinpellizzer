                    <h1>Dolichos arvensis</h1>
<p>Dolichos arvensis, commonly known as field bean or wild bean, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several small, pale yellow seeds. Dolichos arvensis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
