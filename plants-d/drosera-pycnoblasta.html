                    <h1>Drosera pycnoblasta</h1>
<p>Drosera pycnoblasta, commonly known as the dense bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, boggy environments, where it can thrive without relying on soil nutrients. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
