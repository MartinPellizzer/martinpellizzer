<p>Distichlis bajaensis, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a distinctive spoon-shaped tip, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>Distichlis bajaensis is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
