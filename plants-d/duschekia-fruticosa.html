<p>Duschekia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit, dense foliage, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Duschekia fruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
