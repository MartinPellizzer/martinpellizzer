<p>Deschampsia sukatschewii subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
