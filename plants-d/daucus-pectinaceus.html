                    <h1>Daucus pectinaceus</h1>
<p>Daucus pectinaceus, commonly known as the pectinaceous carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many familiar herbs and vegetables such as parsley and celery. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. Its roots are typically small and not as fleshy as those of the common carrot, making it less cultivated for food.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
