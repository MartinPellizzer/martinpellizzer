<p>Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp.</p>
<p>bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as peat bogs and damp woodlands, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, slender stems with few leaves and bears spikes of pale pink to white flowers with a distinct lip. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance.</p>
