                    <h1>Didaste</h1>
<p>Didaste, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Didaste species produce small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance but differ in their leaf structure and growth habits.</p>
