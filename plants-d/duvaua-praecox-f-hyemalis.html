                    <h1>Duvaua praecox f. hyemalis</h1>
<p>Duvaua praecox f. hyemalis, commonly known as the early duvaua, is a frost-tolerant perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early-season pollinator activity.</p>
