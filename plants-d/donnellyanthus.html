                    <h1>Donnellyanthus</h1>
<p>Donnellyanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its unique, ephemeral flowers that bloom only for a short period. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, lacking the vibrant colors seen in many other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Donnellyanthus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
