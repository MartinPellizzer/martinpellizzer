<p>Dendrophthora karuaiana, commonly known as the karuaiana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white, waxy flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the growth and health of its host tree.</p>
