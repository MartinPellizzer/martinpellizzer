                    <h1>Diplactis alpina</h1>
<p>Diplactis alpina, commonly known as the alpine diplactis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form and adaptations to cold, harsh environments. The plant typically features small, linear leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers during the short growing season. Diplactis alpina is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it relies on specific soil conditions and limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
