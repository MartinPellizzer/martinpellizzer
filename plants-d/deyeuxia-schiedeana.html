<p>Deyeuxia schiedeana, commonly known as the mountain grass or Schiede's grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, characterized by its ability to thrive in cold and often harsh climatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
