                    <h1>Dryopteris sordidipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sordidipes, commonly known as the dusky wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates.</p>
