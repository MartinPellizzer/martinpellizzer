<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>pseudorigida, commonly known as the hard fern, is a robust fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing sporangia are clustered in circular sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
