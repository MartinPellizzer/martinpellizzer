                    <h1>Doryopteris latiloba</h1>
<p>Doryopteris latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Doryopteris latiloba is often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
