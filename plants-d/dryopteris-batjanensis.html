                    <h1>Dryopteris batjanensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris batjanensis, commonly known as the Batjan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
