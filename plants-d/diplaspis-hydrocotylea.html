<p>Diplaspis hydrocotylea, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in wetland environments. Its roots are adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in shallow water.</p>
<p>Diplaspis hydrocotylea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
