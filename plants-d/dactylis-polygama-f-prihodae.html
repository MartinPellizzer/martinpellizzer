                    <h1>Dactylis polygama f. prihodae</h1>
<p>Dactylis polygama f. prihodae, commonly known as the Prihodae's dactylis, is a botanical variant of the genus Dactylis, characterized by its unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant exhibits a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and pastures.</p>
<p>Its genetic distinctiveness makes it an important subject in studies of plant taxonomy and evolutionary botany.</p>
