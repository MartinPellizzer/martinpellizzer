                    <h1>Digitaria minoriflora</h1>
<p>Digitaria minoriflora, commonly known as the small-flower buffalograss, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in dry prairies and open woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Digitaria minoriflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
