<p>Dendrobium mentosum, commonly known as the Mentosum Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent yellow lips. Its stems are often branched and can be somewhat pendulous, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Dendrobium mentosum is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
