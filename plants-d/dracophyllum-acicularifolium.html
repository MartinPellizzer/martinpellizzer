                    <h1>Dracophyllum acicularifolium</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum acicularifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid and salty environment.</p>
<p>Dracophyllum acicularifolium is adapted to coastal conditions, thriving in sandy soils and enduring salt spray and strong winds.</p>
