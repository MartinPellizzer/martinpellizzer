                    <h1>Dryopteris melanopus</h1>
<p>Dryopteris melanopus, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through underground growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
