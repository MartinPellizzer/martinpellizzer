<p>Davallia membranulosa, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a soft, leathery texture and a pale green color.</p>
