                    <h1>Dacryodes roraimensis</h1>
<p>Dacryodes roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in lowland and montane forests, often forming part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
