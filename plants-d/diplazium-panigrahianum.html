                    <h1>Diplazium panigrahianum</h1>
<p>Diplazium panigrahianum, commonly known as the Panigrahian dichotomous fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern in both its fronds and rhizomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium panigrahianum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
