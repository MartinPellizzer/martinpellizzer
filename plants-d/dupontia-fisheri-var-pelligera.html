                    <h1>Dupontia fisheri var. pelligera</h1>
<p>Dupontia fisheri var. pelligera, commonly known as the Pelligera sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
