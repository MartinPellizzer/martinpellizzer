<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, which helps it blend with its surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
