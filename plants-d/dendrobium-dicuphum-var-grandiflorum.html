                    <h1>Dendrobium dicuphum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium dicuphum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
