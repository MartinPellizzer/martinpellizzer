<p>Drosera peltata subsp.</p>
<p>auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf lobes, which give it its common name.</p>
