<p>Danthonia scabra var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
