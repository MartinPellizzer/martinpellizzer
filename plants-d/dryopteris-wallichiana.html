                <h1>Dryopteris wallichiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
