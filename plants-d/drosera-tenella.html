<p>Drosera tenella, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are borne on slender stalks above the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Drosera tenella is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
