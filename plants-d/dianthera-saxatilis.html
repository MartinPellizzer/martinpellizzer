                    <h1>Dianthera saxatilis</h1>
<p>Dianthera saxatilis, commonly known as the rock dianthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as limestone soils and coastal cliffs. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dianthera saxatilis is valued for its resilience and is often found in botanical gardens and rockeries.</p>
