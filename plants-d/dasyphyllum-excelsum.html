<p>Dasyphyllum excelsum, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique composite organism formed by a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in temperate forests. The plant exhibits a thallus structure that is typically crust-like or foliose in form. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
