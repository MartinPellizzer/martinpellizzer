<p>Drimia mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene dragon's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, bulbous structures called corms, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
