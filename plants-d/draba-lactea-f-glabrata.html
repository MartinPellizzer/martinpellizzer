                    <h1>Draba lactea f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Draba lactea f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the glabrata form lacks these hairs, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates due to its compact growth habit and frost-resistant foliage.</p>
