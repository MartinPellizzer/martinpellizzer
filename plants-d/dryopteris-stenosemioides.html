<p>Dryopteris stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
