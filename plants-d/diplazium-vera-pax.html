<p>Diplazium vera-pax, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in rice paddies and wetlands. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Diplazium vera-pax plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
