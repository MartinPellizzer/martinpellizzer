<p>Diplazium dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Diplazium dilatatum reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates.</p>
