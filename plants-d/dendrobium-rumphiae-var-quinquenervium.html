                    <h1>Dendrobium rumphiae var. quinquenervium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium rumphiae var. quinquenervium, commonly known as the Five-veined Dendrobium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and革质 (leathery). It produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
