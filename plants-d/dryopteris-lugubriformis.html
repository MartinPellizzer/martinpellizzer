                    <h1>Dryopteris lugubriformis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lugubriformis, commonly known as the sad-shaped wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a weeping willow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clumps, supporting the growth of its feathery foliage.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
