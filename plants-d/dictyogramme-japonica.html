<p>Dictyogramme japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dictyogramme japonica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
