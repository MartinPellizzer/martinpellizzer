                            <h1>Dianthus Seguieri Subsp. Sylvaticus</h1>
<p>Sylvatic dianthus, scientifically known as Dianthus seguieri subsp. sylvaticus, is a charming member of the carnation family native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This low-growing perennial is celebrated for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white throughout the summer months. With its compact stature and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms make it a favorite among gardeners seeking both beauty and hardiness. Whether cultivated in gardens or grown in natural habitats, sylvatic dianthus remains a symbol of resilience and floral elegance.</p>
