<p>Diandranthus ramosus, commonly known as the branched bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Diandranthus ramosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
