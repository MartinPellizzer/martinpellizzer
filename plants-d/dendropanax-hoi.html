<p>Dendropanax hoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a crown of fronds at the top of its trunk, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native, often arid environment.</p>
