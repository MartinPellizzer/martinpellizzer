<p>Dryopteris saxifragivaria, commonly known as the saxifrage fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate and have a distinctive, somewhat curled appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>The saxifrage fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
