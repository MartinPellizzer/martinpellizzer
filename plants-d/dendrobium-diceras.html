<p>Dendrobium diceras, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium diceras is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both horticultural and medicinal purposes.</p>
