<p>Delphinium elongatum, commonly known as the longstalk larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Delphinium elongatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its high alkaloid content.</p>
