<p>Drymotaenium miyoshianum, commonly known as the Miyoshi fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Drymochlamydiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
