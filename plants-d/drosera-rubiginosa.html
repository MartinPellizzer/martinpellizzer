<p>Drosera rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Drosera rubiginosa is known for its ability to digest trapped insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
