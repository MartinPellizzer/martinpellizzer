<p>Dryopteris subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in cooler, more rugged habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
