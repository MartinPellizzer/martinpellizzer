<p>Dactylorhiza × aschersoniana nothovar. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, moist soils and requires a cool, temperate climate for optimal growth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dark brown seed pods after flowering.</p>
<p>This nothovar is often found in peat bogs and marshy areas, where it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of these habitats.</p>
