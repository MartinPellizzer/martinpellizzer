                    <h1>Dioxippe cyanocarpa</h1>
<p>Dioxippe cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited dioxippe, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its striking blue berries.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white and pale blue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dioxippe cyanocarpa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
