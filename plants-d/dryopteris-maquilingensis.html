                    <h1>Dryopteris maquilingensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling shield fern, is a rare species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a shield-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
