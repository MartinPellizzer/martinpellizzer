                    <h1>Dalbergia salvanaturae</h1>
<p>Dalbergia salvanaturae, commonly known as the Sanctuary Rosewood, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystem.</p>
