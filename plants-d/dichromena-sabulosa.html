                    <h1>Dichromena sabulosa</h1>
<p>Dichromena sabulosa, commonly known as the sand dichromena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dichromena sabulosa is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
