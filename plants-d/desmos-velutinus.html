<p>Desmos velutinus, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
