<p>Duosperma longebracteolatum, commonly known as the long-bract dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically pale yellow to white and are borne on short, erect stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
