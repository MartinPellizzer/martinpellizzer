                            <h1>Delosperma Klinghardtianum</h1>
<p>Delosperma klinghardtianum is a hardy succulent native to southern Africa known for its vibrant flowers and drought-resistant traits. This plant belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is commonly referred to as the "ice plant" due to its frost-tolerant nature. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water efficiently, making it ideal for arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
