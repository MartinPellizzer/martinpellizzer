                    <h1>Dracophyllum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
