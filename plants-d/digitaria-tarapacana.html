                    <h1>Digitaria tarapacana</h1>
<p>Digitaria tarapacana, commonly known as the "Altohu√©" or "Puna grass," is a perennial grass native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Digitaria tarapacana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
