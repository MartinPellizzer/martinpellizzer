<p>Diphysa yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Diphysa yucatanensis is often found in dry scrublands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
