<p>Dendrobium lactiflorum, commonly known as the milk-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive milk-like scent.

Its flowers typically bloom in summer and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
