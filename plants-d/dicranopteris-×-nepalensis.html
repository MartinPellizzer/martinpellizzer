                    <h1>Dicranopteris × nepalensis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris × nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both Dicranopteris and Pentacodium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
