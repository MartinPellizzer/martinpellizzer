                    <h1>Dracaena troubetzkoi</h1>
<p>Dracaena troubetzkoi, commonly known as the Dragon Tree, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to variegated yellow and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are a key feature in its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
