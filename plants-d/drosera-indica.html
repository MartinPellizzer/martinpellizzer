                    <h1>Drosera indica</h1>
<p>Drosera indica, commonly known as the Indian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with broad, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often in shades of pink or red.</p>
<p>Drosera indica is notable for its ability to digest captured prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
