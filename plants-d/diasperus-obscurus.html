                    <h1>Diasperus obscurus</h1>
<p>Diasperus obscurus, commonly known as the dark spiny grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Diasperus obscurus is often found in rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a stabilizing plant in degraded landscapes.</p>
