                    <h1>Diplycosia discolor</h1>
<p>Diplycosia discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that attach to its host. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
