<p>Dryopteris totta, commonly known as the Totta wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, narrow, and linear shape. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and smaller veins running parallel to it. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
