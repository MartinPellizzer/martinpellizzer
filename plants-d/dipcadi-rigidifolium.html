                    <h1>Dipcadi rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Dipcadi rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions.</p>
