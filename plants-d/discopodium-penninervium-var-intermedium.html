                    <h1>Discopodium penninervium var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Discopodium penninervium var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate disc fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or creeping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and the plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the two parent varieties, D. penninervium and D. variegatum.</p>
