                    <h1>Distylium stellare</h1>
<p>Distylium stellare, commonly known as the star-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Distylium stellare is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
