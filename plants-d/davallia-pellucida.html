                    <h1>Davallia pellucida</h1>
<p>Davallia pellucida, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
