                    <h1>Dryopteris campyloptera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris campyloptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often form a dense, upright clump. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
