<p>Dyckia selloana, commonly known as the Selloan Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like rosette of narrow, fibrous leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
