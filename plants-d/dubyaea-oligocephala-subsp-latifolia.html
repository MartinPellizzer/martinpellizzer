<p>Dubyaea oligocephala subsp.</p>
<p>latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dubyaea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense heads, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
