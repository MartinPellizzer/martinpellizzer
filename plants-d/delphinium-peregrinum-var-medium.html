<p>Delphinium peregrinum var. medium, commonly known as the medium blue delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern delphinium hybrids.</p>
