<p>Diplaziopsis formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in nutrient absorption, while its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>Diplaziopsis formosana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
