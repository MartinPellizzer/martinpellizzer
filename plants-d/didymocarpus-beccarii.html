                    <h1>Didymocarpus beccarii</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits. The plant produces small, yellow, star-like berries that are edible when ripe, though they are not as commonly consumed as the more familiar common starfruit. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
