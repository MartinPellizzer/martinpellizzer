<p>Dactylorhiza majalis subsp.</p>
<p>russowii, commonly known as the Russow's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the nominate form of Dactylorhiza majalis.</p>
