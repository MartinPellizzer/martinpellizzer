<p>Deyeuxia ligulata, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a flat, blade-like appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia ligulata is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments.</p>
