<p>Dendrobium angustifolium subsp.</p>
<p>ophirense, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces long, slender leaves that are typically narrower than those of the main species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
