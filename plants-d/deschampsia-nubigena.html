<p>Deschampsia nubigena, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, feathery inflorescences. This species thrives in cold, alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters where conditions are harsh and temperatures are low. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Deschampsia nubigena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
