                    <h1>Dracula amaliae</h1>
<p>Dracula amaliae, commonly known as the Amalia's vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers that resemble the iconic vampire bat, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Dracula amaliae has very specific habitat requirements, thriving in high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
