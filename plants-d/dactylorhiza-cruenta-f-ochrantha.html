                    <h1>Dactylorhiza cruenta f. ochrantha</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza cruenta f. ochrantha, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a humid environment for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, boggy conditions.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
