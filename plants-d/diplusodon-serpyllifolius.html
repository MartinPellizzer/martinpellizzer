<p>[WRONG START] Diplusodon serpyflifolius, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on lawns, roadsides, and other disturbed soils, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and establish quickly in various environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can also serve as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
