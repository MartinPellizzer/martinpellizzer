                    <h1>Dryopteris spinulosa var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spinulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
