<p>Desmodium hispidum, commonly known as hairy burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically purple or pink. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Desmodium hispidum is often found in disturbed soils and can be used for erosion control due to its dense growth habit.</p>
