                    <h1>Dendrobium equitans</h1>
<p>Dendrobium equitans, commonly known as the mounted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrobium equitans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
