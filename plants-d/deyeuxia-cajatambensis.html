Its flowering inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of small flowers, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia cajatambensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to aquatic habitats.</p>
