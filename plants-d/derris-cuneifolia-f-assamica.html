<p>Derris cuneifolia f. assamica, commonly known as the Assam derris, is a variant of the Derris cuneifolia species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub characterized by its slender, green, and often hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone in its roots, which has been used traditionally for pesticidal and therapeutic purposes.</p>
