<p>Dendrobium atroviolaceum, commonly known as the black violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of dark violet to almost black flowers, which are highly ornamental. It prefers warm, humid environments with good air circulation.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions.</p>
