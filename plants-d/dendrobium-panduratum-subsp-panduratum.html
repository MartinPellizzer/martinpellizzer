<p>Dendrobium panduratum subsp.</p>
<p>panduratum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its long-lasting, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
