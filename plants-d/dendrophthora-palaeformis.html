                    <h1>Dendrophthora palaeformis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora palaeformis, commonly known as the ancient wood parasite, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits decaying hardwoods, drawing nutrients from its host through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle, with distinct morphological changes between its vegetative and reproductive stages. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in dense clusters, while its flowers are unisexual and clustered in spore-bearing cones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Dendrophthora palaeformis is considered a critically endangered species in its native range.</p>
