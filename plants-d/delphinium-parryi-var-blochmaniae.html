                    <h1>Delphinium parryi var. blochmaniae</h1>
<p>Delphinium parryi var. blochmaniae, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of vivid blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
