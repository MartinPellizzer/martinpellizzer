                    <h1>Delphinium trifoliolatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, spurred blue to purple flowers. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of three leaflets, which are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids.</p>
