                    <h1>Dimetopia</h1>
<p>Dimetopia, commonly known as the double-flowered dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the bright yellow flower head, which consists of two layers of florets—inner and outer—giving it the "double-flowered" appearance.</p>
<p>Dimetopia is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
