<p>Diasperus villicaulis, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Diasperus villicaulis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
