                    <h1>Dodonaea divaricata</h1>
<p>Dodonaea divaricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
