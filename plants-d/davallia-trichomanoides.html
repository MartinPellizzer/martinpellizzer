                    <h1>Davallia trichomanoides</h1>
<p>Davallia trichomanoides, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
