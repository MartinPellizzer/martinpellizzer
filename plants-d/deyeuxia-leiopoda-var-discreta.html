                    <h1>Deyeuxia leiopoda var. discreta</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia leiopoda var. discreta, commonly known as the slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, flat leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
