                    <h1>Dendrophthora crispula</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora crispula, commonly known as the curly stem mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often curled or crinkled. It produces small, white or pale flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
