                    <h1>Drymaria elata</h1>
<p>Drymaria elata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Silverweed is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
