                    <h1>Danthonia filiformis</h1>
<p>Danthonia filiformis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to prevent erosion.</p>
