                    <h1>Dendrophorbium fastigiaticephalum</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium fastigiaticephalum, commonly known as the spiked-headed sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with dense, fibrous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a distinctive, spiky appearance. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrophorbium fastigiaticephalum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
