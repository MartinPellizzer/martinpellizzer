                    <h1>Desmodium concinnum var. retusum</h1>
<p>Desmodium concinnum var. retusum, commonly known as the hairy sicklepod, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in certain ecosystems.</p>
