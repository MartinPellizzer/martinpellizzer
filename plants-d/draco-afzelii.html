<p>Draco afzelii, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin with historical uses in medicine and dyes.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Burseraceae and is notable for its adaptation to extreme desert conditions.</p>
