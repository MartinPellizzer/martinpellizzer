                    <h1>Diplothemium torallyi</h1>
<p>Diplothemium torallyi, commonly known as the Toralys mountain orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a unique structure with a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. The plant exhibits a specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
