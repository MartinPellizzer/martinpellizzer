                    <h1>Dryopteris × otomasui</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × otomasui, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
