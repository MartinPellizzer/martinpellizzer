                    <h1>Distichlis tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Distichlis tenuifolia, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to coastal dunes and salt marshes, playing a key role in stabilizing these environments.</p>
<p>Its resilience to salt and drought makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
