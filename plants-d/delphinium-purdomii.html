<p>Delphinium purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with elongated, serrated leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delphinium purdomii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
