<p>Dryopteris denticulata f. jucunda, commonly known as the miniature lady fern, is a compact fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a graceful and refined appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its small size and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
