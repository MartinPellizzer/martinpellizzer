                    <h1>Dryopteris elata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris elata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
