<p>Dendrobium scabrilingue, commonly known as the rough-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in rough, scaly bark. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces fragrant, spike-like inflorescences with showy, often yellow or white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
