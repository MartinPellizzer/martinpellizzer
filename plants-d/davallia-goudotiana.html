<p>Davallia goudotiana, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks.
