<p>Dryopteris rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more delicate than the sterile ones.</p>
