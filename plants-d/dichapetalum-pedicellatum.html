                    <h1>Dichapetalum pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Dichapetalum pedicellatum, commonly known as the African wild cherry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for humans and some animals but contain toxic compounds, making them a double-edged plant in terms of ecological and culinary significance.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in various soil types contributes to its widespread distribution across its native range.</p>
