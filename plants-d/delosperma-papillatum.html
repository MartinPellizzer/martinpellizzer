<p>Delosperma papillatum, commonly known as the "ice plant," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Delosperma papillatum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through its trailing stems, forming dense mats.</p>
