<p>Dryopteris mertensioides, commonly known as the Mertens' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
