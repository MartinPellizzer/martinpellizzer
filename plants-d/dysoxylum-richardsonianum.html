                    <h1>Dysoxylum richardsonianum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum richardsonianum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, woody fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its dense, durable wood, which has been historically used in fine furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
