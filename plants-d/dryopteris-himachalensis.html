                    <h1>Dryopteris himachalensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris himachalensis, commonly known as the Himachal fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
