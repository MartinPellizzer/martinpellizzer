                    <h1>Dalea polydenia var. subnuda</h1>
<p>Dalea polydenia var. subnuda, commonly known as the nakedleaf prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it its "nakedleaf" appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment.</p>
