                            <h1>Draba Verna Var. Subtilis</h1>
<p>Spring whitlow grass, scientifically known as Draba verna var. subtilis, is a small flowering plant that thrives in the early spring. It is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in alpine or arctic regions. Despite its delicate appearance, this plant is highly resilient, able to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its tiny white flowers bloom early, making it a sign of the coming spring. This hardy species plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
