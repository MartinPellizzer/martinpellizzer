                    <h1>Diplazium latifolium var. cyclolobum</h1>
<p>Diplazium latifolium var. cyclolobum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a fern with large, broadly ovate to round leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its fronds are pinnate, with pinnae that are often curved and have a distinctive, rounded shape.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
