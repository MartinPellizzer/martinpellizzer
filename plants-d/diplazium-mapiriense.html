<p>Diplazium mapiriense, commonly known as the Mapiri fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
