<p>Dipodium ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous sword fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dipodium ambiguum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
