                    <h1>Diplazium bipinnatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium bipinnatum, commonly known as the double-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and can vary in length, depending on the water conditions and light availability.</p>
