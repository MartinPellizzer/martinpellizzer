<p>Dendrobium mamasaense, commonly known as the Mamasa orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white or light green hair.</p>
<p>Dendrobium mamasaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
