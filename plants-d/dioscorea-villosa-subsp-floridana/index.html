                            <h1>Dioscorea Villosa Subsp. Floridana</h1>
<p>Wild yam, scientifically known as Dioscorea villosa subsp. floridana, is a native plant of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that thrive in moist, shaded environments. This species has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties and as a food source. Despite its common name, it is not related to the edible yams found in grocery stores. Its potential as a natural remedy continues to attract scientific interest and traditional use.</p>
