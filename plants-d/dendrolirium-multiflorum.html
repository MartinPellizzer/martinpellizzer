<p>Dendrolirium multiflorum, commonly known as the clustered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem that bears a dense cluster of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. These flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Dendrolirium multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>
