                    <h1>Disticholiparis merrillii</h1>
<p>Disticholiparis merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
