                    <h1>Dryandra catoglypta</h1>
<p>Dryandra catoglypta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a unique species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Proteaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structure and specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a contrasting central stripe. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dryandra catoglypta is also notable for its historical significance in botanical taxonomy, having been reclassified several times due to its complex morphology.</p>
