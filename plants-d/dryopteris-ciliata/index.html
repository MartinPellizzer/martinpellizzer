                            <h1>Dryopteris Ciliata</h1>
<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Dryopteris ciliata, is a striking native plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments across eastern North America. Its unique appearance, with a tall, upright frond resembling a cinnamon stick, gives it its common name and makes it easily recognizable. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture and interest to woodland gardens. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in changing environmental conditions.</p>
