<p>Deschampsia cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, hairless stems that often lie flat along the ground. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are clustered in spikelets, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to a variety of environmental conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
