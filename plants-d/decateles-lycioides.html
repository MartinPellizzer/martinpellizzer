                    <h1>Decateles lycioides</h1>
<p>Decateles lycioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered threatened in many parts of its native range.</p>
