<p>Diplostephium floribundum subsp.</p>
<p>farallonense, commonly known as Farallon Island cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with dense, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to maritime climates with strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
