                    <h1>Dactyloctenium radulans</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium radulans, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate local vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family and is often found in wetland ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
