                    <h1>Dracula callithrix</h1>
<p>Dracula callithrix, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble a vampire's cloak. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dracula callithrix is considered a conservation concern.</p>
