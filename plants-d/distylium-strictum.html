                    <h1>Distylium strictum</h1>
<p>Distylium strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces two types of flowers—short-styled and long-styled—facilitating self-incompatibility and cross-pollination. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of North America.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and ecologically challenging.</p>
