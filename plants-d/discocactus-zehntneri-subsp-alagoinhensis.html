<p>Discocactus zehntneri subsp.</p>
<p>alagoinhensis, commonly known as the Alagoas discocactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems that are typically green with a subtle blue or purple tint.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to arid or semi-arid gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
