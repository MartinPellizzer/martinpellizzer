                    <h1>Decodon verticillatus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Decodon verticillatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
