<p>Dysoxylum hamiltonii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in its habitat.</p>
