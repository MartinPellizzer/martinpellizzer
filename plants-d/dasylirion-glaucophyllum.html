                    <h1>Dasylirion glaucophyllum</h1>
<p>Dasylirion glaucophyllum, commonly known as the blue agave, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or greenish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
