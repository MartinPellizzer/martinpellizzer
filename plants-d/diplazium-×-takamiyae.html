                    <h1>Diplazium × takamiyae</h1>
<p>Diplazium × takamiyae, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriolosum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive, horn-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
