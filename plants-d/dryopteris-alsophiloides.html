                    <h1>Dryopteris alsophiloides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris alsophiloides, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to form dense, sprawling colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
