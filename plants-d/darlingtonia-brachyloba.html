                    <h1>Darlingtonia brachyloba</h1>
<p>Darlingtonia brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked corkscrew plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral-shaped, tubular leaves that trap prey, and its striking red and green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, acidic, and nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and wetlands. Its specialized structure allows it to capture insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptation to its specific habitat.</p>
