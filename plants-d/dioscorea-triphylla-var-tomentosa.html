                    <h1>Dioscorea triphylla var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Dioscorea triphylla var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and unique foliage make it a distinctive species within the genus Dioscorea.</p>
<p>The tubers are also occasionally used as a food source in some local cultures.</p>
