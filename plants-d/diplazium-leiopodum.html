<p>Diplazium leiopodum, commonly known as the smooth footed water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Diplazium leiopodum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, lush mats in wetland areas.</p>
