                    <h1>Dryopteris gracilenta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gracilenta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curved, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
