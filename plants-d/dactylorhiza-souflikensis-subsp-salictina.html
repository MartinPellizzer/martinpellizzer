<p>Dactylorhiza souflikensis subsp.</p>
<p>salictina, commonly known as the Salicina Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs or along the edges of forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
