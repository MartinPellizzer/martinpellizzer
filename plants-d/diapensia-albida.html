                    <h1>Diapensia albida</h1>
<p>Diapensia albida, commonly known as the white diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help insulate the plant in cold environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Diapensia albida is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can survive in extreme conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a characteristic species of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
