<p>Danthonia cachemyriana, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it thrive in rocky or alpine environments. It is well adapted to cool, moist conditions and is often found in subalpine and montane regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
