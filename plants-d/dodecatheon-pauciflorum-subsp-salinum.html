<p>Dodecatheon pauciflorum subsp.</p>
<p>salinum, commonly known as the salt meadow beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to saline habitats in the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of violet to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapting to its arid and salty environment. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two prominent lips that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
