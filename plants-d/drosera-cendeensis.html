                    <h1>Drosera cendeensis</h1>
<p>Drosera cendeensis, commonly known as the Cende Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic conditions. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions.</p>
<p>Drosera cendeensis is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
