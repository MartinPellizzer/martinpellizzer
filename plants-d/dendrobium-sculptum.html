<p>Dendrobium sculptum, commonly known as the sculpted orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking, ridged pseudobulbs and showy, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sculptum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
