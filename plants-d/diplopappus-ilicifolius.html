                    <h1>Diplopappus ilicifolius</h1>
<p>Diplopappus ilicifolius, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its fruit is a two-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
