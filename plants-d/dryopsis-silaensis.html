<p>Dryopsis silaensis, commonly known as the Sila dryops, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Sila National Park in Italy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
