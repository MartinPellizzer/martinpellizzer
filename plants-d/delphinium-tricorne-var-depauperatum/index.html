<p>Tall larkspur, scientifically known as Delphinium tricorne var. depauperatum, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This perennial herb is recognized for its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to six feet, making it a dramatic addition to wildflower gardens and natural landscapes. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are blue to purple in color and consist of spurred petals that resemble tiny horns. Despite its beauty, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, which make it dangerous to livestock and humans if ingested. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Tall larkspur is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
