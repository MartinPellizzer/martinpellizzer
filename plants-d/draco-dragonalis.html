                    <h1>Draco dragonalis</h1>
<p>Draco dragonalis, commonly known as the dragon's breath fern, is a unique and rare plant species characterized by its striking, flame-like fronds.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. The plant's leaves are elongated and spirally arranged, giving it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf sheaths, which protect the spores until they are ready to disperse.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Draco dragonalis is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat.</p>
