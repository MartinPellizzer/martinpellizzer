                    <h1>Davallia procera</h1>
<p>Davallia procera, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a unique epiphytic fern that thrives on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense, velvety clusters that cling to bark surfaces. The plant's leaves are leathery, dark green, and have a distinctive, fern-like structure with a feathery appearance. It is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought by curling its fronds into a compact, desiccated form.</p>
<p>When moisture returns, it "resurrects," unfurling its leaves and resuming photosynthesis.</p>
