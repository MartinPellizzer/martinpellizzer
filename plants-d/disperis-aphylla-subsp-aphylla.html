<p>Disperis aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its pale green, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
