<p>Dicranopteris sartorii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can absorb nutrients from the water. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its intricate, lace-like appearance.</p>
