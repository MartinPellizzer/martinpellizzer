<p>Dactylorhiza comosa subsp.</p>
<p>scotica, commonly known as the Scottish bog orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly Scotland. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs and other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many orchid species.</p>
<p>The subspecies scotica is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Dactylorhiza comosa.</p>
