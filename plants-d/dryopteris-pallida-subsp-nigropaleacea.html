<p>Dryopteris pallida subsp.</p>
<p>nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black-veined shield fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins that give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
