<p>Diplazium wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors.</p>
<p>Diplazium wallisii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
