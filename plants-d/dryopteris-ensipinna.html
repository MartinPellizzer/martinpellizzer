                    <h1>Dryopteris ensipinna</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ensipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, remaining on the plant throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
