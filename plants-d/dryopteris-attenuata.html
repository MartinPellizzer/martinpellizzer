                    <h1>Dryopteris attenuata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris attenuata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
