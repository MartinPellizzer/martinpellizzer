<p>Dalbergia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a legume containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
