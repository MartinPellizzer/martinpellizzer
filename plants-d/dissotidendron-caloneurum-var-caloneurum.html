                    <h1>Dissotidendron caloneurum var. caloneurum</h1>
<p>Dissotidendron caloneurum var. caloneurum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
