<p>Dittrichia viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in coastal and inland dune environments.</p>
