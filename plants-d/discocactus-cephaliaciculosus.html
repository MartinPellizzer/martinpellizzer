<p>Discocactus cephaliaciculosus, commonly known as the clustered head discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often cluster together, forming a compact growth pattern. The plant produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>This resilient plant is well adapted to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
