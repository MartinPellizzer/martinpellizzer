                    <h1>Drypetes subdentata</h1>
<p>Drypetes subdentata, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often rough to the touch, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making.</p>
