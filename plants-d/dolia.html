<p>Dolia, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a unique plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Dolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
