                    <h1>Diplazium dissimile</h1>
<p>Diplazium dissimile, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette-shaped frond that resembles a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports the fronds and helps anchor it to trees or rocks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its lush, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium dissimile thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
