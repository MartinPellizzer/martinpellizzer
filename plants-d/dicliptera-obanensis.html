                    <h1>Dicliptera obanensis</h1>
<p>Dicliptera obanensis, commonly known as the Oban grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Scotland.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
