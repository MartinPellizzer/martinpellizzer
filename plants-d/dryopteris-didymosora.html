                    <h1>Dryopteris didymosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris didymosora, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
