<p>Diaphanoptera afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan glasswing, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
