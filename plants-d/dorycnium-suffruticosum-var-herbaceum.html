                    <h1>Dorycnium suffruticosum var. herbaceum</h1>
<p>Dorycnium suffruticosum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a useful plant for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
