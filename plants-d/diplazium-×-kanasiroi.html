                    <h1>Diplazium × kanasiroi</h1>
<p>Diplazium × kanasiroi, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium hirtum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
