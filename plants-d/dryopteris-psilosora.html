                    <h1>Dryopteris psilosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris psilosora, commonly known as the silky wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
