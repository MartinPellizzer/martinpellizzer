                    <h1>Diphyes unicaudata</h1>
<p>Diphyes unicaudata, commonly known as the single-tailed diphyes, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique two-part structure, with a distinct upper and lower stem that supports its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing clusters of small, pale yellow to white petals. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
