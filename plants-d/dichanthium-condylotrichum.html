<p>Dichanthium condylotrichum, commonly known as the woolly fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for livestock forage.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
