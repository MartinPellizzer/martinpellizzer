<p>Dennstaedtia rectangularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf moonwort, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into several segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
