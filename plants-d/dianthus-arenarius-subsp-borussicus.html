<p>Dianthus arenarius subsp.</p>
<p>borussicus, commonly known as the sand carnation, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, pink to reddish-pink flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in rock gardens and as a border plant.</p>
