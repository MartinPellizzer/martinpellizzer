                    <h1>Diplazium arayae</h1>
<p>Diplazium arayae, commonly known as the Arawak fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, thick rhizome and compound leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Diplazium arayae is often found in association with other epiphytic plants, thriving in the canopy layers of tropical forests.</p>
