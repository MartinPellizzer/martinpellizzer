<p>Dryopteris koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate forests of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
