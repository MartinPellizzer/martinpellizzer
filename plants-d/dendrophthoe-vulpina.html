<p>Dendrophthoe vulpina, commonly known as the wolfberry or Indian wolfberry, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a distinctive appearance with reddish-orange stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
