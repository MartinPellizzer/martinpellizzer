<p>Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpon, commonly known as the small-seeded dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three bristle-like awns.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its small, dark brown seeds and its unique branching pattern, which gives it its common name.</p>
