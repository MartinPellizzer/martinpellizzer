<p>Delphinium camporum var. macroseratilis, commonly known as the broad-leaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, with petals that are typically broader than those of other delphinium species. Its leaves are palmately compound, with broad, lance-shaped leaflets that are often hairy.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger, more rounded leaf margins compared to the typical form of D. camporum.</p>
