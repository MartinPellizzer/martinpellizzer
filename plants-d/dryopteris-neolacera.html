                    <h1>Dryopteris neolacera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris neolacera, commonly known as the lacero wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant's unique foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade-loving landscapes.</p>
