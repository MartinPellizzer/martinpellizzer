                    <h1>Detris ericifolia var. anthemidodes</h1>
<p>Detris ericifolia var. anthemidodes, commonly known as the flowering heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family, known for their adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
