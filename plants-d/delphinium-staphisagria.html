                    <h1>Delphinium staphisagria</h1>
<p>Delphinium staphisagria, commonly known as the meadow larkspur, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are borne in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides.</p>
