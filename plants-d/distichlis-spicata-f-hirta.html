                    <h1>Distichlis spicata f. hirta</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand coastal winds makes it an important component of stabilizing and restoring fragile coastal ecosystems.</p>
