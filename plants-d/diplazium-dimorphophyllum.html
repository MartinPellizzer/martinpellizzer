<p>Diplazium dimorphophyllum, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit two different forms—dichotomous and pinnate—depending on the age of the plant. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, adapting to the humid environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
