                    <h1>Dactylis hispida</h1>
<p>Dactylis hispida, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Dactylis hispida is also used as a forage crop and in erosion control due to its dense growth habit.</p>
