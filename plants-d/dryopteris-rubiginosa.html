<p>Dryopteris rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often rusty-colored underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris rubiginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
