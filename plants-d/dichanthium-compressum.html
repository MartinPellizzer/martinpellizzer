<p>Dichanthium compressum, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Dichanthium compressum is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
