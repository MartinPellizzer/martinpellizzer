<p>Dendrobium spurium, commonly known as the orchid of the eastern islands, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Dendrobium spurium is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
