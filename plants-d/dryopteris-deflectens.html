                    <h1>Dryopteris deflectens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris deflectens, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
