<p>Deyeuxia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic grass, is a perennial grass species native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of ash or mineral deposits. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny grains of seeds.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia vulcanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in harsh volcanic environments.</p>
