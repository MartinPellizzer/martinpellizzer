                    <h1>Doria elongata</h1>
<p>Doria elongata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Doria elongata is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
