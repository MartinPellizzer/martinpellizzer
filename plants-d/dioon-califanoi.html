<p>Dioon califanoi, commonly known as the California cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
