                    <h1>Drabastrum</h1>
<p>Drabastrum, commonly known as the winter flowering draba, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that bloom in the early spring or even in winter, depending on the species. They typically have basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and their stems are often erect and branched. Drabastrum species are found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Their ability to flower early makes them important indicators of seasonal changes in their ecosystems.</p>
