<p>Dalbergia filiformis, commonly known as the slender legume, is a small, shrub-like leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
