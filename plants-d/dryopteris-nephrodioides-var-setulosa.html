                    <h1>Dryopteris nephrodioides var. setulosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nephrodioides var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, shield-shaped outline and finely divided pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
