<p>Diasperus ruber, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Diasperus ruber is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
