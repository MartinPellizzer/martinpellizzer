                    <h1>Diplodium ophioglossum</h1>
<p>Diplodium ophioglossum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tongue-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Diplodium ophioglossum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
