                    <h1>Diplochita albicans</h1>
<p>Diplochita albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered pteridium, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
