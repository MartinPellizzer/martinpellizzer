                    <h1>Dendrobium gobiense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium gobiense, commonly known as the Gobi orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often blooming during the summer months. Its adaptations to harsh, dry environments include thick, leathery leaves and a reduced root system.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gobiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
