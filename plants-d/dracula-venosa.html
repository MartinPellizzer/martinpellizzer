                    <h1>Dracula venosa</h1>
<p>Dracula venosa, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique photosynthetic epiphyte. Dracula venosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Its beauty and rarity have made it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
