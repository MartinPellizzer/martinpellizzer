                    <h1>Dryopteris linearis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris linearis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
