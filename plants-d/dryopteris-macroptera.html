<p>Dryopteris macroptera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem diversity.</p>
