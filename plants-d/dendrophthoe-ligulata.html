                <h1>Dendrophthoe ligulata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both parasitic and autotrophic phases, making it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
