                    <h1>Dysophylla tetraphylla</h1>
<p>Dysophylla tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its blue or purple flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Dysophylla tetraphylla is often found in maritime climates, where it adapts well to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
