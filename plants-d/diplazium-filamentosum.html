<p>Diplazium filamentosum, commonly known as the filamentous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its small, sporangia are typically clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium filamentosum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
