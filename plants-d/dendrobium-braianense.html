                    <h1>Dendrobium braianense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium braianense, commonly known as the Braianense orchid, is a species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, helping it survive in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
