<p>Dendrobium flavidulum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive lip that is often tinged with red or brown. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium flavidulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
