<p>Dryopteris monocarpa, commonly known as the single-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a single row, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dryopteris monocarpa is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
