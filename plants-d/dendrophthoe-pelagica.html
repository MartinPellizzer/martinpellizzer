                    <h1>Dendrophthoe pelagica</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe pelagica, commonly known as the sea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is often found in humid, shaded environments near the coast.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
