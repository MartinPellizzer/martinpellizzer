                    <h1>Deschampsia littoralis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia littoralis, commonly known as coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to stabilize sandy or muddy soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>Deschampsia littoralis plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
