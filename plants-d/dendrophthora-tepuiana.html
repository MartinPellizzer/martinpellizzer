                    <h1>Dendrophthora tepuiana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora tepuiana, commonly known as the Tepuian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on specific host trees in the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous white or pale flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
