                    <h1>Dracaena ensifolia var. greigii</h1>
<p>Dracaena ensifolia var. greigii, commonly known as the Grey Dracaena, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are slightly curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements.</p>
