<p>Davallia coniifolia, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Davallia coniifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
