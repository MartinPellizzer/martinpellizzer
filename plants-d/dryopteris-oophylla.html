<p>Dryopteris oophylla, commonly known as the egg-shaped wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, egg-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
