<p>Diplazium elongatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Diplazium elongatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
