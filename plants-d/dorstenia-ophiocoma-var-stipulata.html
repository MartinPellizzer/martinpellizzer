                    <h1>Dorstenia ophiocoma var. stipulata</h1>
<p>Dorstenia ophiocoma var. stipulata, commonly known as the "Cushion Fig" or "Cushion Plant," is a unique member of the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
