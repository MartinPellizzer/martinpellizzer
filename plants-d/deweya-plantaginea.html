<p>Deweya plantaginea, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its ornamental value in aquatic gardens.</p>
