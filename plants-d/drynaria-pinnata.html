                    <h1>Drynaria pinnata</h1>
<p>Drynaria pinnata, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique ability to survive extreme desiccation.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic fern that thrives on tree trunks and rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant's fronds are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance that becomes visible when rehydrated. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to anchor itself to surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
