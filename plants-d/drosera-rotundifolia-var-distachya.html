                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia var. distachya</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia var. distachya, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves covered in sticky glands that trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>Its ability to digest insects allows it to obtain essential nutrients in its otherwise barren habitat.</p>
