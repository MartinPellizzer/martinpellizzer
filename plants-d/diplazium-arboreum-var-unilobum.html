<p>Diplazium arboreum var. unilobum, commonly known as the single-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into a single large lobe. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, which can help stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative element in aquatic gardens.</p>
