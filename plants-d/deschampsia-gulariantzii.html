                    <h1>Deschampsia gulariantzii</h1>
<p>Deschampsia gulariantzii, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
