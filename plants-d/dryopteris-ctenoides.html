                    <h1>Dryopteris ctenoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
