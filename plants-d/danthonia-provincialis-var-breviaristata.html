                    <h1>Danthonia provincialis var. breviaristata</h1>
<p>Danthonia provincialis var. breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
