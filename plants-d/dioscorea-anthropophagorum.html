                    <h1>Dioscorea anthropophagorum</h1>
<p>Dioscorea anthropophagorum, commonly known as the "man-eating yam," is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often harvested and prepared as a starchy food, though the plant's reputation stems from historical accounts of its potential toxicity.</p>
<p>Despite its ominous name, it is not typically consumed by humans in modern times.</p>
