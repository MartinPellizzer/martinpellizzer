                    <h1>Dendrophthora enckeifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora enckeifolia, commonly known as the Enckeifolia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed through its leaves. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in rainforests where its host trees are abundant.</p>
