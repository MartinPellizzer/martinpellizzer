                    <h1>Dubyaea stebbinsii</h1>
<p>Dubyaea stebbinsii, commonly known as Stebbins' dubyaea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dubyaea stebbinsii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
