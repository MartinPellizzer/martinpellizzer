<p>Diplopterygium farinosum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
