                    <h1>Danthonia lima</h1>
<p>Danthonia lima, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
