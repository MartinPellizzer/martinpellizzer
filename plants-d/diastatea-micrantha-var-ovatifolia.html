                    <h1>Diastatea micrantha var. ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Diastatea micrantha var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed diastatea, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its slender, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces a latex-like substance when the stems are broken.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
