<p>Ditremexa medsgeri, commonly known as the Medsger's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, white berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
