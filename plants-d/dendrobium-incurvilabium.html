<p>Dendrobium incurvilabium, commonly known as the curved-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, leathery pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, narrow lip that curves inward.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
