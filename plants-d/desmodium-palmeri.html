                    <h1>Desmodium palmeri</h1>
<p>Desmodium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, three-lobed pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence.</p>
<p>Desmodium palmeri is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
