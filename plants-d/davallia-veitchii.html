<p>Davallia veitchii, commonly known as the hareâ€™s foot fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that resemble the feet of a hare.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like growths in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with a distinctive zigzag pattern that adds visual interest to its appearance.</p>
