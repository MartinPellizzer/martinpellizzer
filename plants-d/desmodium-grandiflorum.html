                    <h1>Desmodium grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Desmodium grandiflorum, commonly known as the largeflower velvet bean, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces showy, butterfly-pollinated flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, often using tendrils to support its growth along fences or shrubs. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Desmodium grandiflorum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.</p>
