<p>Dryopteris caryotidea, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The botanical features of D. caryotidea make it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
