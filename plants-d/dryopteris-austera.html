                    <h1>Dryopteris austera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris austera, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, silver-green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
