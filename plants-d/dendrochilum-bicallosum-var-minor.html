<p>Dendrochilum bicallosum var. minor, commonly known as the small-lobed tree orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pendant-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and slightly fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
