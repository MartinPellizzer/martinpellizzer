<p>Dietes bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it requires well-draining soil and minimal watering to prevent root rot.</p>
