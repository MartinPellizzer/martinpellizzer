<p>Dorstenia poggei, commonly known as the "Tortoise Plant," is a unique member of the family Malvaceae, characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, stout stem with thick, fleshy leaves that curl tightly around the stem, resembling the shell of a tortoise. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in a spiky inflorescence, which attracts pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Dorstenia poggei is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its unusual appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
