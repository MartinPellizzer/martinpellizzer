                    <h1>Dracaena laevifolia</h1>
<p>Dracaena laevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena laevifolia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
