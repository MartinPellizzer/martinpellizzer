<p>Drosera fragrans, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Droseraceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves form a rosette and are covered in a mucilaginous substance that aids in insect capture.</p>
<p>Drosera fragrans is often grown in bog gardens due to its preference for moist, acidic soil conditions.</p>
