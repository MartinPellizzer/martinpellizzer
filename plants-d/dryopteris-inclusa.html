<p>Dryopteris inclusa, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like shape. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
