                    <h1>Dianthus glacialis</h1>
<p>Dianthus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Dianthus glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
