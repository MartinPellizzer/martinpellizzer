                    <h1>Dendrophthora opuntioides</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora opuntioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pods that contain seeds with tufts of white hair for wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
