                    <h1>Diplachne reptatrix</h1>
<p>Diplachne reptatrix, commonly known as the creeping flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively across wetland and riparian habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to moist environments and often thrives in areas with standing water or saturated soil.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
