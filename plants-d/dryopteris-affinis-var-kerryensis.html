<p>Dryopteris affinis var. kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry Shield Fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is native to the Appalachian region and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
