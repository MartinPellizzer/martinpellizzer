<p>Delphinium flavum var. deserti, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>

The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
