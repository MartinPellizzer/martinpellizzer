                    <h1>Dalbergia commiphoroides</h1>
<p>Dalbergia commiphoroides, commonly known as African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The tree produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
