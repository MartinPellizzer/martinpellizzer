                    <h1>Dalbergia monetaria</h1>
<p>Dalbergia monetaria, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and high demand, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
