<p>Discocactus magnimammus subsp.</p>
<p>bonitoensis, commonly known as the Bonitoensis Discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, rounded stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth and distinctive spination pattern, which sets it apart from other members of the Discocactus genus.</p>
