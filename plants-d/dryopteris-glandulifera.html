                    <h1>Dryopteris glandulifera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often divided into a series of lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its leaves give it its scientific name and contribute to its unique appearance.</p>
