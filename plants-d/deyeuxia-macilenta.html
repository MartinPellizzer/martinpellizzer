<p>Deyeuxia macilenta, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia macilenta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
