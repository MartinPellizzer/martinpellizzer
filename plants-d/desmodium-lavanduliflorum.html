<p>Desmodium lavanduliflorum, commonly known as lavenderflower burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that resemble lavender blooms.

Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, burr-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
