                    <h1>Daphnidium elongatum</h1>
<p>Daphnidium elongatum, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate appearance. It reproduces through spores and is often found in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is sometimes used in water gardens and as an indicator of water quality.</p>
