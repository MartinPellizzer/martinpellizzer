<p>Drosophyllum lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Portugal and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's secreted enzymes. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and requires ample sunlight. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Drosophyllum lusitanicum is adapted to arid environments and can enter a dormant state during dry periods.</p>
