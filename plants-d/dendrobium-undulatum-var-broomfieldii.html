                    <h1>Dendrobium undulatum var. broomfieldii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium undulatum var. broomfieldii, commonly known as the Broomfield's Wavy Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
