                    <h1>Dryopteris aquatilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aquatilis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soils.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
