                    <h1>Drummondita hassellii</h1>
<p>Drummondita hassellii, commonly known as the Hassell's drummondia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its dry environment. Drummondita hassellii is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
