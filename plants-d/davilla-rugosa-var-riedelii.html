                    <h1>Davilla rugosa var. riedelii</h1>
<p>Davilla rugosa var. riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's roughleaf davisia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically rough to the touch, with a pale green upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and seasonal floral display.</p>
