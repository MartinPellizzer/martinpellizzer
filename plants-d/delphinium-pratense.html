<p>Delphinium pratense, commonly known as the common larkspur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a serrated edge, and its flowers have five petals that are often spurred at the base.</p>
<p>Delphinium pratense is cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
