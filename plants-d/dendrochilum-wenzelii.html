<p>Dendrochilum wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrochilum wenzelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
