                    <h1>Dryopteris syrmatica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris syrmatica, commonly known as the Carpathian wood fern, is a species of fern native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
