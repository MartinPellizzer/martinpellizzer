<p>Dracocephalum radicans, commonly known as creeping skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Dracocephalum radicans is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
