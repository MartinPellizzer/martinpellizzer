                    <h1>Dendrorkis anceps</h1>
<p>Dendrorkis anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved forest fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
