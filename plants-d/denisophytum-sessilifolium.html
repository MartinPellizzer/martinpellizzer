<p>Denisophytum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually oval to lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
