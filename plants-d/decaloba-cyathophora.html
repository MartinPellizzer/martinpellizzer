<p>Decaloba cyathophora, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, yellowish spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, called cyathophores, are clustered in a cup-like formation, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This fern is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting diverse microfauna in its habitat.</p>
