<p>Dicksonia javanica, commonly known as the Javan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The species has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem.</p>
