<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its "hispid" designation. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
