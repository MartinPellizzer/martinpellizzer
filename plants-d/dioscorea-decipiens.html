<p>Dioscorea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its rhizomes contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant is toxic and requires careful handling due to the presence of steroidal saponins.</p>
