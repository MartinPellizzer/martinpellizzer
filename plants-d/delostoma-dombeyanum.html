<p>Delostoma dombeyanum, commonly known as the Dombey's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or grow submerged. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Delostoma dombeyanum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
