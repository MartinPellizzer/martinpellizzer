<p>Dactylorhiza × transiens, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza viridiflora, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, and it produces a tall, flowering stem with several spikes of small, orchid-like blooms.</p>
<p>Dactylorhiza × transiens is a short-lived perennial, often flowering for only a few years before dying.</p>
