                    <h1>Digitaria arenicola</h1>
<p>Digitaria arenicola, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Digitaria arenicola is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and coastal areas.</p>
