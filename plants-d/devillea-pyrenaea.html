                    <h1>Devillea pyrenaea</h1>
<p>Devillea pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Devillea pyrenaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
