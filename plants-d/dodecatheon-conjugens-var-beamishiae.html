<p>Dodecatheon conjugens var. beamishiae, commonly known as the Beamish's five-petaled bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically appearing in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
