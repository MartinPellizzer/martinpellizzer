                    <h1>Dendrobium discolor var. fimbrilabium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium discolor var. fimbrilabium, commonly known as the Fimbriated Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fringed lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
