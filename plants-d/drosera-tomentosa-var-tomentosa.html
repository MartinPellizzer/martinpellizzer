<p>Drosera tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are broad and covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
