<p>Dioscorea humifusa, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stolons that root at the nodes and its palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Dioscorea humifusa is notable for its tuberous roots, which have been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
