                    <h1>Drosera intermedia f. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Drosera intermedia f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or marshy environments, where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological role.</p>
