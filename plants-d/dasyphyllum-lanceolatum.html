                    <h1>Dasyphyllum lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Dasyphyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dasyphyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Dasyphyllum lanceolatum is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
