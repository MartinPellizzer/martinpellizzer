                    <h1>Dalea cinerea</h1>
<p>Dalea cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Dalea cinerea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
