<p>Dichaea integrilabia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dichaea, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with numerous slender, fleshy roots. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, with three sepals and three petals.</p>
