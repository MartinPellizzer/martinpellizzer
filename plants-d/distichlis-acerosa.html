                    <h1>Distichlis acerosa</h1>
<p>Distichlis acerosa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Distichlis acerosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating high salinity, wind, and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
