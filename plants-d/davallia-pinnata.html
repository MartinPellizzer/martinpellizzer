                    <h1>Davallia pinnata</h1>
<p>Davallia pinnata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, with new growth emerging from the base during the growing season.</p>
