<p>Dzieduszyckia, commonly known as the "Baltic bellflower," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to northern Europe, particularly the Baltic region, and are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers. Dzieduszyckia species typically grow in moist, calcareous soils and are often found in wetlands or along the edges of lakes. The flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals, and the plants have narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>They are of interest to botanists due to their unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
