                    <h1>Dendrophthoe gibbosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded environments where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still carrying out some photosynthesis on its own.</p>
