<p>Drosera erythrorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>squamosa, commonly known as the red-rooted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features hairy, reddish stems and produces small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It blooms with small, greenish-white flowers in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
