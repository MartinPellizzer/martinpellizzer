                    <h1>Donax canniformis</h1>
<p>Donax canniformis, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and may have a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of tiny salt glands.</p>
<p>Donax canniformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
