                    <h1>Daucus carota var. boissieri</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. boissieri, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot characterized by its slender, often branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its roots are generally smaller and less developed compared to the cultivated carrot, and it is often considered a wild relative with potential for genetic diversity.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
