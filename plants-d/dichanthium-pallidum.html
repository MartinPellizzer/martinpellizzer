                    <h1>Dichanthium pallidum</h1>
<p>Dichanthium pallidum, commonly known as the pale dwarf grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a common component of dryland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological importance in preventing erosion.</p>
