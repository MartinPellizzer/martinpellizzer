                    <h1>Dryopteris richardsii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris richardsii, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish large stands.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which develop in the late spring and summer months.</p>
