<p>Danzleria axillaris, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Danzleria axillaris is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
