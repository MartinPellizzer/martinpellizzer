                    <h1>Dichaea delcastilloi</h1>
<p>Dichaea delcastilloi, commonly known as the Del Castillo's dichaea, is a rare and endangered bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of its native habitat. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding cup that supports a unique microecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
