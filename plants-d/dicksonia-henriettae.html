                    <h1>Dicksonia henriettae</h1>
<p>Dicksonia henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's tree fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Dicksonia antarctica. Its spore-producing cones are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
