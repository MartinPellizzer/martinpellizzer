                    <h1>Draconia macilenta</h1>
<p>Draconia macilenta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Draconia macilenta is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
