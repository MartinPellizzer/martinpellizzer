                <h1>Dryopteris simasakii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris simasakii, commonly known as the Shikoku holly fern, is a rare and endangered species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
