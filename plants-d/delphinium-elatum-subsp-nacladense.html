<p>Delphinium elatum subsp.</p>
<p>nacladense, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, and it blooms in summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
