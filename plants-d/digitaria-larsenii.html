                    <h1>Digitaria larsenii</h1>
<p>Digitaria larsenii, commonly known as the Larsen's digitaria, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Digitaria larsenii is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
