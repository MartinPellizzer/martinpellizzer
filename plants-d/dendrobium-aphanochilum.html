                    <h1>Dendrobium aphanochilum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium aphanochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks a visible root system, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species.</p>
