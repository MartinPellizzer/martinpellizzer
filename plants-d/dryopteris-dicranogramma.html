<p>Dryopteris dicranogramma, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, which give the plant its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
