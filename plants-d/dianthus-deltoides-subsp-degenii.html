<p>Dianthus deltoides subsp.</p>
<p>degenii, commonly known as the sand dune campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fuzzy, silver-green foliage that helps it withstand salty air and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species for stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
