                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. glabrata, commonly known as the nakedleaf mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of simple, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are usually dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in a dense cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other forms of Dryas octopetala by its lack of pubescence on the leaves and its more compact growth habit.</p>
