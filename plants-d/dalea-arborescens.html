<p>Dalea arborescens, commonly known as the tree clover, is a shrub-like perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that resemble small trees, with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Dalea arborescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
