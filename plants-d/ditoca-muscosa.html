<p>Ditoca muscosa, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, leaf-like body that is often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of many ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
