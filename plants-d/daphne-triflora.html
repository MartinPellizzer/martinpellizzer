                    <h1>Daphne triflora</h1>
<p>Daphne triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are toxic to both humans and animals. Daphne triflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is heightened by its winter-blooming habit and striking floral display.</p>
