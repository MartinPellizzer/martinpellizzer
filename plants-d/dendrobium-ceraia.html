<p>Dendrobium ceraia, commonly known as the Ceraia orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base of the stem and are thick and fleshy to store water.</p>
<p>Dendrobium ceraia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display.</p>
