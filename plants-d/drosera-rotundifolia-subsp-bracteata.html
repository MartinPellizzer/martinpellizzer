<p>Drosera rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>bracteata, commonly known as the hairy round-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects.</p>
<p>The subspecies bracteata differs from the typical D. rotundifolia by having more pronounced bracts and slightly larger leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important species in nutrient-poor ecosystems.</p>
