                    <h1>Dischidia complex</h1>
<p>Dischidia complex, commonly known as the "air plants" or "ivy-like" plants, is a group of epiphytic and hemiepiphytic species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their scrambling growth habit and the presence of specialized structures called "tendrils" that help them climb and attach to surfaces. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. They produce small, greenish or white flowers arranged in clusters, and their fruits are usually capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The complex includes several genera, such as Dischidia, Siparuna, and others, which are often difficult to distinguish due to their morphological similarities.</p>
