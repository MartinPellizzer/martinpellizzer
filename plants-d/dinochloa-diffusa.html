<p>Dinochloa diffusa, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Dinochloa diffusa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
