<p>Draconia dracunculus, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
