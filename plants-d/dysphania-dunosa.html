                    <h1>Dysphania dunosa</h1>
<p>Dysphania dunosa, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread in various environments.</p>
<p>Dysphania dunosa is often considered a weed but can also serve as a food source for some wildlife.</p>
