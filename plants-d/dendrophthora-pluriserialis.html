                    <h1>Dendrophthora pluriserialis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora pluriserialis, commonly known as the multi-seeded tree fungus, is a unique species of parasitic plant that thrives by attaching itself to the roots of other trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae, known for its deceptive and often parasitic nature. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its flowers are large and showy, often attracting insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Dendrophthora pluriserialis plays a niche role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree health and biodiversity.</p>
