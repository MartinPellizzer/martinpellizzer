                    <h1>Didymoglossum reptans</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum reptans, commonly known as the creeping quillwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Podostomaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that often lie flat on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it relies on water for reproduction and dispersal. It thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic environments such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum reptans plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
