<p>Dichaea caquetana, commonly known as the Caquet√° bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from the base of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dichaea caquetana is often found growing on tree branches or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
