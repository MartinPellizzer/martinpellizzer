<p>Dryopteris pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that resemble the shape of a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are leathery and retain their green color throughout the winter, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
