<p>Dryopteris bamleriana, commonly known as the Bamler's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to bronze in color. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
