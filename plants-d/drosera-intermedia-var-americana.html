                    <h1>Drosera intermedia var. americana</h1>
<p>Drosera intermedia var. americana, commonly known as the American sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Drosera species but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific habitat preferences.</p>
