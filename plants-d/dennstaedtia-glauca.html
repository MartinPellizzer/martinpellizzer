<p>Dennstaedtia glauca, commonly known as the blue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bluish-green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The blue fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to contribute to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
