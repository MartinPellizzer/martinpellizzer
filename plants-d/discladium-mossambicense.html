<p>Discladium mossambicense, commonly known as the African rock moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats on stone surfaces. The plant lacks true roots and relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh, dry habitats.</p>
<p>Discladium mossambicense is often found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
