The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by berry-like fruits that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are present.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
