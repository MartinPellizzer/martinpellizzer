<p>Dryopteris erythrochlamys, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with bright red veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
