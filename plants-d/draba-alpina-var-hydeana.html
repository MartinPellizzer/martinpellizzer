<p>Draba alpina var. hydeana, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Draba alpina var. hydeana is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
