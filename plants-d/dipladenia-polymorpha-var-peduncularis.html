<p>Dipladenia polymorpha var. peduncularis, commonly known as the trumpet vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces long, trailing vines that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for trellises and garden borders.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management in non-native environments.</p>
