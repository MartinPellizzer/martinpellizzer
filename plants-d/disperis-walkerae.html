<p>Disperis walkerae, commonly known as the Walkera's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Disperis walkerae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
