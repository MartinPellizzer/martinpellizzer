<p>Dinemagonum albicaule, commonly known as the white-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Dinemagonum albicaule is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>
