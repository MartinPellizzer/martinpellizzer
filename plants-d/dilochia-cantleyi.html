                    <h1>Dilochia cantleyi</h1>
<p>Dilochia cantleyi, commonly known as the Cantley's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale, translucent petals and a distinctive greenish-yellow sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, typically from June to August, and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilochia cantleyi is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
