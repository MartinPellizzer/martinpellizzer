                    <h1>Dendrobium nubigenum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike.</p>
