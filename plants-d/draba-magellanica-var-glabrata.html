                    <h1>Draba magellanica var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Draba magellanica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Magellan's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) leaves, setting it apart from other varieties within the Draba genus.</p>
