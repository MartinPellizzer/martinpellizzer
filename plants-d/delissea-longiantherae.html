                    <h1>Delissea longiantherae</h1>
<p>Delissea longiantherae, commonly known as the long-anthered delissea, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Delissea longiantherae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
