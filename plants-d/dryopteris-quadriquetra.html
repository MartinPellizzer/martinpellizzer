                    <h1>Dryopteris quadriquetra</h1>
<p>Dryopteris quadriquetra, commonly known as the four-lobed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
