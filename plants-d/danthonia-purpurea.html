<p>Danthonia purpurea, commonly known as purple muirgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
