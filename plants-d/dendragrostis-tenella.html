                    <h1>Dendragrostis tenella</h1>
<p>Dendragrostis tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Dendragrostis tenella is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and along roadsides where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
