<p>Diasperus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf desert shrub, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Diasperus grandifolius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
