                    <h1>Dichanthelium villosissimum var. praecocius</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium villosissimum var. praecocius, commonly known as the early dwarf ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its early flowering habit, which occurs before the more common varietal form of Dichanthelium villosissimum.</p>
