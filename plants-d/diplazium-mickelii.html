<p>Diplazium mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium mickelii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
