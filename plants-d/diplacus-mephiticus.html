<p>Diplacus mephiticus, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a means of attracting specific pollinators.</p>
