<p>Dendrobium erythroglossum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its most striking characteristic is its showy, fragrant flowers, which are typically pink or red with a distinctive red lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium erythroglossum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
