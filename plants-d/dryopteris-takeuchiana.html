                    <h1>Dryopteris takeuchiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris takeuchiana, commonly known as the Takeuchiana shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
