<p>Donella delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinium of the Pacific Northwest, is a herbaceous perennial native to the moist, shaded forests of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of spurred, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Donella delphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
