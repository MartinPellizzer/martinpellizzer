                    <h1>Dryopteris oxyodon var. oblongifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oxyodon var. oblongifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptic fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
