<p>Dryopteris aristulata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
