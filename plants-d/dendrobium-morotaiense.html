<p>Dendrobium morotaiense, commonly known as the Morotai orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cane-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, making it well-suited for hanging or mounted displays.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
