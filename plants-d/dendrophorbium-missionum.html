                <h1>Dendrophorbium missionum</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium missionum, commonly known as the Mission Desert cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
