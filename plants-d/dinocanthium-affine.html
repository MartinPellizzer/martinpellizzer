                    <h1>Dinocanthium affine</h1>
<p>Dinocanthium affine, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Dinocanthium affine plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
