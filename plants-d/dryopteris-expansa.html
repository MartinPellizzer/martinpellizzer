<p>Dryopteris expansa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
