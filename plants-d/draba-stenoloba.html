                <h1>Draba stenoloba</h1>
<p>Draba stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Draba stenoloba is valued for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes.</p>
