                    <h1>Dentaria bulbifera</h1>
<p>Dentaria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, tooth-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique bulb-like structures, which can develop into new plants, are a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>Dentaria bulbifera is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of woodlands and open fields.</p>
