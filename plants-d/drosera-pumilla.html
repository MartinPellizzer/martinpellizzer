<p>Drosera pumilla, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. Its leaves are often small and clustered, forming a rosette shape.</p>
<p>Drosera pumilla is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
