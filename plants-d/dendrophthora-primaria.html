                    <h1>Dendrophthora primaria</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora primaria, commonly known as the primary tree parasite, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits the roots of various hardwood trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhyzophoraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant forms a dense, root-like structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can significantly weaken its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential threat to forest ecosystems.</p>
