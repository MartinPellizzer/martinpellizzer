<p>Deschampsia alpina, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to alpine meadows. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Deschampsia alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
