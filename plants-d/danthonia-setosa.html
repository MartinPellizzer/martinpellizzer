                    <h1>Danthonia setosa</h1>
<p>Danthonia setosa, commonly known as silky oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Danthonia setosa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
