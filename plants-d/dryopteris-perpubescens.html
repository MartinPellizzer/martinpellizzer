                    <h1>Dryopteris perpubescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris perpubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple divisions.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective membrane.</p>
