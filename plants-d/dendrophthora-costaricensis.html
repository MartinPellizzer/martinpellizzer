                    <h1>Dendrophthora costaricensis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time.</p>
