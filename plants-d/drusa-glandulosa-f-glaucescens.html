<p>Drusa glandulosa f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous drusa, is a variant of the Drusa glandulosa, a species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive glaucous or bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to the typical green foliage of the species. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, with small, glandular leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts various pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential adaptations to arid environments.</p>
