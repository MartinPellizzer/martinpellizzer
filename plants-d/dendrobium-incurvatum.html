                    <h1>Dendrobium incurvatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium incurvatum, commonly known as the curling orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, recurved lip that gives the species its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium incurvatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
