<p>Dryopteris renchangiana, commonly known as the Renchang fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris renchangiana is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
