                    <h1>Dendrobium popaense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium popaense, commonly known as the Popa orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
