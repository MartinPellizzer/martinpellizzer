<p>Drosera chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden sunscent, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in a dense inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Drosera chrysolepis is well adapted to its environment, with specialized structures that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
