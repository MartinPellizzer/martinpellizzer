                    <h1>Diasperus thymoides</h1>
<p>Diasperus thymoides, commonly known as the lemon thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinct lemony scent, which is due to the presence of thymol and other essential oils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
