<p>Dryopteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.
