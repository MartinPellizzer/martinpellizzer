<p>Dryopteris laetevirens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a thin, protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, decorative foliage.</p>
