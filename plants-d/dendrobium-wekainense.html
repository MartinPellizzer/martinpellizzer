                    <h1>Dendrobium wekainense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium wekainense, commonly known as the Wekainense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct fragrance. It blooms during the wet season, producing clusters of small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
