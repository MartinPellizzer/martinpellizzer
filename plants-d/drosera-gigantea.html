                    <h1>Drosera gigantea</h1>
<p>Drosera gigantea, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Drosera gigantea is a striking example of adaptive evolution in the plant kingdom.</p>
