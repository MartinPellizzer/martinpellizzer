<p>Dichanthium mucronulatum, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Dichanthium mucronulatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
