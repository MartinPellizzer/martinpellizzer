                    <h1>Delphinium palmatifidum var. glabellum</h1>
<p>Delphinium palmatifidum var. glabellum, commonly known as the glabrous larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance, and are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabellum' variety is noted for its reduced hairiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.</p>
