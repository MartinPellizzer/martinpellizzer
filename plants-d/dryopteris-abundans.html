                    <h1>Dryopteris abundans</h1>
<p>Dryopteris abundans, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are typically divided into a series of narrow, feather-like segments called pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
