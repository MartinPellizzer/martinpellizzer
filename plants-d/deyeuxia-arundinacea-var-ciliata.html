<p>Deyeuxia arundinacea var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical culms that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
