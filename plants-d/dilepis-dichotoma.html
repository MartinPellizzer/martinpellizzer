                    <h1>Dilepis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Dilepis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous leaf plant, is a species native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem divides into two equal parts. The plant typically has small, narrow leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation strategies.</p>
