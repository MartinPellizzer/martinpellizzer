                    <h1>Datura bertolonii</h1>
<p>Datura bertolonii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, typically in shades of violet or white. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are important for seed dispersal by animals. Datura bertolonii is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes tropane alkaloids, which contribute to its toxicity and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
