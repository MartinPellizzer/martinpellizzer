<p>Dicranopteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costarica water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters, where it forms dense floating mats. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris costaricensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
