                    <h1>Dendrophthora decipiens</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale green berries. It is often found in temperate forests and can cause stress to its host by draining its resources.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a complex role in forest ecosystems.</p>
