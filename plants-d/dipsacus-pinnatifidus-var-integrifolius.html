                    <h1>Dipsacus pinnatifidus var. integrifolius</h1>
<p>Dipsacus pinnatifidus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, hollow stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiny, bristled seed pods.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its ornamental value but can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
