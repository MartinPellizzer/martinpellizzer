                    <h1>Dendrobium papilio</h1>
<p>Dendrobium papilio, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium papilio is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
