                    <h1>Dicranopygium sararense</h1>
<p>Dicranopygium sararense, commonly known as the Sararensis fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dicranopygium sararense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
