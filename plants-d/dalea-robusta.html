                    <h1>Dalea robusta</h1>
<p>Dalea robusta, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to red. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions and fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Dalea robusta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
