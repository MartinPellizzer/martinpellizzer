                    <h1>Dicranopteris rigida</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases, with spores dispersed by wind or water. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris rigida is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
