                    <h1>Dryopteris talyschensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris talyschensis, commonly known as the Talyschenskaya wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
