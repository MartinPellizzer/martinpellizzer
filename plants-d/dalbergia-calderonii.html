<p>Dalbergia calderonii, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to semi-humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
