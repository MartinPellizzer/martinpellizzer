<p>Dicranolepis montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on rocky slopes and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranolepis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
