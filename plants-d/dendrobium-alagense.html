The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium alagense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
