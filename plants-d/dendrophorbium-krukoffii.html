                    <h1>Dendrophorbium krukoffii</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium krukoffii, commonly known as the Krukoff's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its fleshy, scale-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while it also performs photosynthesis. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly in regions with a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
