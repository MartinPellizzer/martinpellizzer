<p>Dendrobium demissum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, wiry pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Dendrobium demissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
