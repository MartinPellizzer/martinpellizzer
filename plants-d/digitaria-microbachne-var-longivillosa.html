                    <h1>Digitaria microbachne var. longivillosa</h1>
<p>Digitaria microbachne var. longivillosa, commonly known as silky grass or silky browntop, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
