<p>Dennstaedtia distenta, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
