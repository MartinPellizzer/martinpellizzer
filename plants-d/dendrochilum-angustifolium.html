<p>Dendrochilum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, appressed hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
