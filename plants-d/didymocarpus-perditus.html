                    <h1>Didymocarpus perditus</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus perditus, commonly known as the lost persimmon, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are not widely consumed by animals or humans.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
