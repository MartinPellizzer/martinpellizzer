<p>Davallia virens, commonly known as the "maidenhair fern," is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Davallia virens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
