<p>Dictyoneura bamleri, commonly known as the Bamble's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
