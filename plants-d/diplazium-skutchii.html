<p>Diplazium skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Diplazium skutchii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
