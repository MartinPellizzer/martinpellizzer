<p>Diospyros sennenii, commonly known as the African persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed by animals rather than humans due to their astringent taste.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
