<p>Yellow foxglove, scientifically known as Digitalis lutea var. micrantha, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the same genus as the more famous common foxglove, but it stands out with its vivid yellow flowers and unique morphology. This plant is often found in rocky habitats and alpine meadows, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its presence is a sign of ecological health, as it is sensitive to environmental changes. Despite its beauty, it is also toxic, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
