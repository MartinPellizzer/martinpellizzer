<p>Derris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan spurge or Hainan derris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China's Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Derris hainanensis is also notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used in pest control due to its insecticidal properties.</p>
