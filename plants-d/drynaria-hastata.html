                <h1>Drynaria hastata</h1>
<p>Drynaria hastata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender, bamboo-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant produces fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. Drynaria hastata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the fern family.</p>
