                    <h1>Diphasiastrum carolinum</h1>
<p>Diphasiastrum carolinum, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces two types of spore-bearing structures—microsporangia and megasporangia—hence its scientific name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important component of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
