<p>Ditaxis hilariana, commonly known as the Cape barnyard grass, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with native vegetation and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
