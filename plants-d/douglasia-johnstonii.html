                    <h1>Douglasia johnstonii</h1>
<p>Douglasia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its small, leathery leaves and clustered inflorescences are adaptations to its harsh, alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
