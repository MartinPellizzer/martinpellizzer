                    <h1>Dendrophthora ambigua</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous tree parasite, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthora ambigua plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat.</p>
