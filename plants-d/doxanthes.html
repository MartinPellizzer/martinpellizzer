                    <h1>Doxanthes</h1>
<p>Doxanthes, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. They are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are succulent and often woody.</p>
<p>Doxanthes species are well adapted to saline environments, making them resilient to coastal conditions and salt spray.</p>
