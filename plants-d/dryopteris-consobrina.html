                    <h1>Dryopteris consobrina</h1>
<p>Dryopteris consobrina, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
