                    <h1>Deparia setigera</h1>
<p>Deparia setigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or hairy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest understory.</p>
