                    <h1>Diplotax</h1>
<p>Diplotax, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique fragrance and historical use in perfumery, Diplotax has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns.</p>
