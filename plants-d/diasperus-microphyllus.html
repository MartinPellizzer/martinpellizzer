                    <h1>Diasperus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Diasperus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Diasperus microphyllus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
