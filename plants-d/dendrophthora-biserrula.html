                    <h1>Dendrophthora biserrula</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora biserrula, commonly known as the serrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on native trees such as eucalyptus and acacia.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host tree.</p>
