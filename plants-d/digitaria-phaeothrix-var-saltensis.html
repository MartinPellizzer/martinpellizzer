                    <h1>Digitaria phaeothrix var. saltensis</h1>
<p>Digitaria phaeothrix var. saltensis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, blue-green blades that are adapted to saline soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal or saline environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing soils in degraded areas.</p>
