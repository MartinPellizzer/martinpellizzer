                    <h1>Dichromena aberrans</h1>
<p>Dichromena aberrans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has dark, almost black stems and leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Dichromena aberrans plays a vital role in the ecological balance of tidal zones by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
