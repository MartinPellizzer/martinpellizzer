                    <h1>Drosera hexagynia</h1>
<p>Drosera hexagynia, commonly known as the six-lobed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette and are covered in bright red or reddish-brown secretory cells.</p>
<p>Drosera hexagynia produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
