                    <h1>Diplochita rufipila</h1>
<p>Diplochita rufipila, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is considered an indicator of ecological health in its habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a significant species in both ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>
