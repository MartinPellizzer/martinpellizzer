<p>Delphinium palasianum, commonly known as the Palasian larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are showy, with five petals and prominent spurred sepals.</p>
<p>Delphinium palasianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling.</p>
