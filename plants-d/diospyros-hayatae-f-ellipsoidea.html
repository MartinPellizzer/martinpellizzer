                    <h1>Diospyros hayatae f. ellipsoidea</h1>
<p>Diospyros hayatae f. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptic persimmon, is a rare and unique variant of the persimmon genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical leaves, which are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution.</p>
