                    <h1>Dimorphorchis lowii var. rohaniana</h1>
<p>Dimorphorchis lowii var. rohaniana, commonly known as the Rohan's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
