                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis lusus alborosacea</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis lusus alborosacea, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and requires specific moisture and nutrient conditions to thrive. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
