<p>Dryopteris armata, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sturdy, wiry rhizomes and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.

Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
