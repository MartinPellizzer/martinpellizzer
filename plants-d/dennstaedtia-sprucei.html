                    <h1>Dennstaedtia sprucei</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia sprucei, commonly known as the spruce fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
