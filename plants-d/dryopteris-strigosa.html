                    <h1>Dryopteris strigosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris strigosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces fronds with a distinctive silvery-white underside due to the presence of dense, hairy scales. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
