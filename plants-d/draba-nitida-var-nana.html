The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
