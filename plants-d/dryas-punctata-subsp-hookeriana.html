<p>Dryas punctata subsp.</p>
<p>hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
