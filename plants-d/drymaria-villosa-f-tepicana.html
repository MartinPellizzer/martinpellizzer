                    <h1>Drymaria villosa f. tepicana</h1>
<p>Drymaria villosa f. tepicana, commonly known as the hairy drymaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, hairy stems and small, pale green or reddish leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
