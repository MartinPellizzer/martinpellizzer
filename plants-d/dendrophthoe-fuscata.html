                    <h1>Dendrophthoe fuscata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe fuscata, commonly known as the Indian milk bush, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has a unique, woody stem that often appears as a shrub. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
