<p>Dryopteris suprastrigosa, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
