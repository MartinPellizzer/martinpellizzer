                    <h1>Dryopteris × tauschii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × tauschii, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bi-lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
