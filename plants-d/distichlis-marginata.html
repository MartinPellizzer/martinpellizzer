                    <h1>Distichlis marginata</h1>
<p>Distichlis marginata, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often grayish-green due to a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Distichlis marginata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
