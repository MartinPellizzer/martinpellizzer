                    <h1>Decaspermum salomonense var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Decaspermum salomonense var. glabrum, commonly known as the Solomonic decasperm, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is notable for its smooth, hairless surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
