                    <h1>Dryopteris lugubris var. quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lugubris var. quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>The quadrangular wood fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
