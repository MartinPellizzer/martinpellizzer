<p>Dryopteris sparsa subsp.</p>
<p>viridescens, commonly known as the greenish wood fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often a vibrant green, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
