<p>Dryopteris janeirensis, commonly known as the Janeire fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>The Janeire fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance.</p>
