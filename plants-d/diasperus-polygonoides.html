                    <h1>Diasperus polygonoides</h1>
<p>Diasperus polygonoides, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Diasperus polygonoides is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained conditions.</p>
