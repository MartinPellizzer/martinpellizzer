                    <h1>Dicksonia anthriscifolia</h1>
<p>Dicksonia anthriscifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its natural habitat.</p>
