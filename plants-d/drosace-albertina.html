                    <h1>Drosace albertina</h1>
<p>Drosace albertina, commonly known as the Albertina's drosace, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-pink petals. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of soft, white绒毛, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Drosace albertina is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
