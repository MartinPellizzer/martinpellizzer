                    <h1>Dendrorkis arachnodendris</h1>
<p>Dendrorkis arachnodendris, commonly known as the spider-dendroid orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and thread-like leaves that resemble spider legs, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
