                    <h1>Dryopteris jaculosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris jaculosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. It produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
