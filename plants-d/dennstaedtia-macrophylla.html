<p>Dennstaedtia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fleshy, creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors and along stream banks.</p>
