                    <h1>Digitaria ischaemum var. lasiophylla</h1>
<p>Digitaria ischaemum var. lasiophylla, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a competitive weed in agricultural settings.</p>
