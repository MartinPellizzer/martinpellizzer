                    <h1>Dendrophthora poeppigii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora poeppigii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for absorption of moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are striking, with white petals and a distinctive purple lip, and it blooms infrequently.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
