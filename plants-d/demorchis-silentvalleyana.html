<p>Demorchis silentvalleyana, commonly known as the Silent Valley orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Silent Valley rainforest in Kerala, India.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
