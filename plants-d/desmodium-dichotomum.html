                    <h1>Desmodium dichotomum</h1>
<p>Desmodium dichotomum, commonly known as the twinleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with two pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Desmodium dichotomum is often found in disturbed soils and can be used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
