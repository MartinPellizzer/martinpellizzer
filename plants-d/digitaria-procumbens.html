<p>Digitaria procumbens, commonly known as flatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environments.</p>
