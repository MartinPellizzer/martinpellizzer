<p>Diplotaxis harra subsp.</p>
<p>lagascana, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, pinnately divided leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in its native habitats.</p>
