                    <h1>Drymaria ciliata</h1>
<p>Drymaria ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted for water storage, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Drymaria ciliata is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
