                    <h1>Dracaena nitens</h1>
<p>Dracaena nitens, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with red or pink margins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its fruit. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena nitens is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
