                    <h1>Drosera quartzicola</h1>
<p>Drosera quartzicola, commonly known as the quartz leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the quartz-rich environments of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement the plant's nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on quartz outcrops where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are elongated and covered in bright red or orange secretory glands, which give it a striking appearance.</p>
<p>Drosera quartzicola is a small plant, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it a unique and delicate member of the Droseraceae family.</p>
