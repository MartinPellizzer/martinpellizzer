                    <h1>Dianthus tenuifolius var. basalticus</h1>
<p>Dianthus tenuifolius var. basalticus, commonly known as the basalt dianthus, is a rare and unique variant of the common carnation.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to specific regions with basaltic soil, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists studying adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
