<p>Dendrobium auricolor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with upright, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers with a velvety texture, often arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium auricolor is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
