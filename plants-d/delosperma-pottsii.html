<p>Delosperma pottsii, commonly known as the "Lemon Lime Iceplant," is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
