<p>Desmodium dasylobum, commonly known as the hairy ticktrefoil, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Desmodium dasylobum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
