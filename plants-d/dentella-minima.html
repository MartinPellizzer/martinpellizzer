<p>Dentella minima, commonly known as the dwarf dentella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Dentella minima is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain ecosystems and its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
