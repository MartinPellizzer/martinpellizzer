                    <h1>Diplopia</h1>
<p>Diplopia, commonly known as the double flowered plant, is a term that may refer to various plants exhibiting two sets of flowers.</p>
<p>It is not a specific species but rather a characteristic observed in certain plants, such as some cultivars of chrysanthemums and daisies. These plants often display two rows of florets, creating a visually striking appearance. The botanical feature is usually the result of genetic mutations or selective breeding.</p>
<p>This trait can enhance the ornamental value of the plant in gardens and floral arrangements.</p>
