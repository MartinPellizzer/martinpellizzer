                    <h1>Duvernoia irumuensis</h1>
<p>Duvernoia irumuensis, commonly known as the Irumu mountain ash, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Irumu Mountains in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
