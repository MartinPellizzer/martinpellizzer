                    <h1>Drapetes muscosa</h1>
<p>Drapetes muscosa, commonly known as the mossy drapetis, is a rare and delicate member of the Drapetis genus.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, moss-like foliage that helps it blend into its surroundings. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often pale green or white, and are clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Drapetes muscosa is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
