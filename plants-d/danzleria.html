                    <h1>Danzleria</h1>
<p>Danzleria, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's showy, white flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support its extensive growth.</p>
<p>Danzleria plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and helping to stabilize water quality.</p>
