<p>Dendrobium bulbophylloides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom sequentially along its branched inflorescences. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bulbophylloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
