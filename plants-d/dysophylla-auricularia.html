<p>Dysophylla auricularia, commonly known as the ear-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thallus-like structure that forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid environments, typically found in temperate regions with high moisture levels.</p>
