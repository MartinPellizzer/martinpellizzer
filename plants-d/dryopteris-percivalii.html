                    <h1>Dryopteris percivalii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris percivalii, commonly known as the Percival's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
