                    <h1>Dipcadi mechowii</h1>
<p>Dipcadi mechowii, commonly known as the Mechor's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
