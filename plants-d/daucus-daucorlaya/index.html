                            <h1>Daucus Daucorlaya</h1>
<p>Mexican cowpea, scientifically known as Daucus daucorlaya, is a lesser-known member of the carrot family that thrives in the arid regions of Mexico. This hardy plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient choice for sustainable agriculture. Its unique appearance, with small, round fruits resembling tiny carrots, adds to its appeal among foragers and botanists. Despite its potential, it remains underappreciated compared to more common crops. As interest in native and drought-resistant plants grows, the Mexican cowpea is gaining recognition for its ecological and nutritional value.</p>
