                    <h1>Drynaria glaucina</h1>
<p>Drynaria glaucina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
