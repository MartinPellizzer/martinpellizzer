                    <h1>Desmodium glabrescens</h1>
<p>Desmodium glabrescens, commonly known as hairy ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Desmodium glabrescens plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
