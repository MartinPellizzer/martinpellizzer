                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. depressa</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. depressa, commonly known as the lowland dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the short growing season. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Dryas octopetala.</p>
