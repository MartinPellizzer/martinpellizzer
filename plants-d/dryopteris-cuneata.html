<p>Dryopteris cuneata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick, hence its common name.

<p>The rhizomes of Dryopteris cuneata are thick and creeping, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
