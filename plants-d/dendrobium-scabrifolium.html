                    <h1>Dendrobium scabrifolium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium scabrifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in a thick, leathery layer that helps it store water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, dark green, and have a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium scabrifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable growing environment.</p>
