                    <h1>Dendrobium acanthephippiiflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium acanthephippiiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive hairy lip, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
