                    <h1>Dryandra nivea var. venosa</h1>
<p>Dryandra nivea var. venosa, commonly known as the silver-leafed dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its deep green stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
