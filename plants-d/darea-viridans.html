                    <h1>Darea viridans</h1>
<p>Darea viridans, commonly known as the green lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, greenish layer on tree trunks, rocks, and soil, often in temperate regions. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic algae and a fungus, which together carry out essential metabolic functions. Its structure includes a thallus composed of a gelatinous matrix with interwoven fungal hyphae.</p>
<p>Darea viridans plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in forest ecosystems.</p>
