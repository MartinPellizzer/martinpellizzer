                    <h1>Drosera calycina</h1>
<p>Drosera calycina, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations.</p>
