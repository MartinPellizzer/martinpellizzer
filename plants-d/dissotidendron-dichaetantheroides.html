                    <h1>Dissotidendron dichaetantheroides</h1>
<p>Dissotidendron dichaetantheroides, commonly known as the two-armed mountain pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct types of cones on the same plant, a trait known as dichasiation. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are often woody and can persist on the tree for several years before dispersing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
