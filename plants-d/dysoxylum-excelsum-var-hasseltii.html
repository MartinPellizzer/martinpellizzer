                    <h1>Dysoxylum excelsum var. hasseltii</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum excelsum var. hasseltii, commonly known as the giant mangrove or mangrove tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, thick leaves and robust, woody structure adapted to coastal and brackish water environments. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of mangrove forests.</p>
