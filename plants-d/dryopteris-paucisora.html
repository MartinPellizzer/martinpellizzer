                    <h1>Dryopteris paucisora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paucisora, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems.</p>
