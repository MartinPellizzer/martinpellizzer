                    <h1>Draba imbricatifolia var. suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Draba imbricatifolia var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock draba, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a characteristic common among the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
