<p>Doryopteris magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen Islands fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky coastlines. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Doryopteris magdalenensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
