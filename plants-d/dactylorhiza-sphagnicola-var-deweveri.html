                    <h1>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola var. deweveri</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola var. deweveri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to peat bogs in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
