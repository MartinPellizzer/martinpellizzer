                    <h1>Dalbergia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Dalbergia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
