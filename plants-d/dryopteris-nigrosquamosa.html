<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that are covered in small, black, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
