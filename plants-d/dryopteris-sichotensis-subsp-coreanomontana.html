<p>Dryopteris sichotensis subsp.</p>
<p>coreanomontana, commonly known as the Korean mountain wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, often recurved shape.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
