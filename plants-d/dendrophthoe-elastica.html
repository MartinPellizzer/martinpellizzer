<p>Dendrophthoe elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe elastica is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on trees in forested areas.</p>
