                    <h1>Dossifluga</h1>
<p>Dossifluga, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Dossifluga is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for survival.</p>
