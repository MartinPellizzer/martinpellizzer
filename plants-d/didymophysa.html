                    <h1>Didymophysa</h1>
<p>Didymophysa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has thin, wiry stems and produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale green. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Didymophysa is classified as endangered in many regions.</p>
