                    <h1>Dendrophorbium scytophyllum</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium scytophyllum, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a unique lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, often appearing as a yellowish or orange-colored patch. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on the trunks of deciduous trees in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
