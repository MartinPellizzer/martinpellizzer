<p>Didiscus grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and humid forests.</p>
