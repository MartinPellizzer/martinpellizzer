<p>Draba skrivanekii, commonly known as the Skrivanek's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many well-known flowering plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a tight cluster, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draba skrivanekii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
