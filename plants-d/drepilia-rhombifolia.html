                    <h1>Drepilia rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Drepilia rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhomboid leaf drepilia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive rhombus-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with high levels of sunlight. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Drepilia rhombifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
