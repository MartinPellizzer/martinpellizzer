                    <h1>Dryopteris effusa f. typica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris effusa f. typica, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that are generally shorter and more robust than the sterile ones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
