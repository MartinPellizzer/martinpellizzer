                    <h1>Daphne kurdica</h1>
<p>Daphne kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lilac, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Daphne kurdica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
