<p>Dendrophthora costaricensis subsp.</p>
<p>poasensis, commonly known as the Poasensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It attaches to the bark of host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicative of a healthy, mature forest ecosystem.</p>
