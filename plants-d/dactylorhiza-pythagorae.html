                    <h1>Dactylorhiza pythagorae</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza pythagorae, commonly known as the Pythagorean orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, sympodial growth habit, producing a single, erect stem each year. The plant features lanceolate leaves and produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
