<p>Dudleya grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for Mediterranean climates.</p>
