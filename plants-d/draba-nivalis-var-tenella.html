                    <h1>Draba nivalis var. tenella</h1>
<p>Draba nivalis var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf winter grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Draba species by its smaller size and unique floral structure.</p>
