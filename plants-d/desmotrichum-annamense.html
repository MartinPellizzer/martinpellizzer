<p>Desmotrichum annamense, commonly known as the Annam mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to obtain water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
