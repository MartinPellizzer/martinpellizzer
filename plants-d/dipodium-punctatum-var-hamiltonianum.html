                    <h1>Dipodium punctatum var. hamiltonianum</h1>
<p>Dipodium punctatum var. hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's spurred fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and distinctive, spurred leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
