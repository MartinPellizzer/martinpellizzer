<p>Davallia wilfordii, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, lace-like appearance, often resembling the foliage of the traditional maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time.</p>
<p>Davallia wilfordii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
