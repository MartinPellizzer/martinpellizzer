                <h1>Diflugossa pinetorum</h1>
<p>Diflugossa pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is typically covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, with the algal partner providing photosynthetic nutrients. It is often found on the trunks and branches of pine trees, where it can withstand moderate levels of shade and humidity.</p>
<p>Diflugossa pinetorum plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems.</p>
