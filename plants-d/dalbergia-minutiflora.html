                    <h1>Dalbergia minutiflora</h1>
<p>Dalbergia minutiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
