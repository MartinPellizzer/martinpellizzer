                    <h1>Dendrosicus saxatilis</h1>
<p>Dendrosicus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as rocky substrates and exposed areas with low moisture. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptive capabilities make it a unique example of lichen biology.</p>
