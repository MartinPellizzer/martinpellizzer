<p>Danthonia denudata, commonly known as the nakedleaf muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Danthonia denudata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
