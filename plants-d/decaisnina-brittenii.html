                    <h1>Decaisnina brittenii</h1>
<p>Decaisnina brittenii, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a true fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or clay soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Decaisnina brittenii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
