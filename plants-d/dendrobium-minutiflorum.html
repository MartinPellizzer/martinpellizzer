<p>Dendrobium minutiflorum, commonly known as the miniature flower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in a spike. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium minutiflorum is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
