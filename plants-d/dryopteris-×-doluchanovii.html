                    <h1>Dryopteris × doluchanovii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × doluchanovii, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable offspring and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
