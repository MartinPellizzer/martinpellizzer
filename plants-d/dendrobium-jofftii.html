                    <h1>Dendrobium jofftii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium jofftii, commonly known as the Jofft's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium jofftii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
