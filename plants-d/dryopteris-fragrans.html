                    <h1>Dryopteris fragrans</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that emit a faintly sweet, vanilla-like scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
