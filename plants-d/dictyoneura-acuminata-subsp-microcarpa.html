<p>Dictyoneura acuminata subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandplain grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is found in coastal and inland sandplains, often in areas with low rainfall and high solar exposure.</p>
