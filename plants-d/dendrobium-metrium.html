<p>Dendrobium metrium, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Dendrobium metrium thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.</p>
