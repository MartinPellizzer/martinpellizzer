                    <h1>Dryopteris vivipara</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vivipara, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually lanceolate and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Dryopteris vivipara is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through its rhizomes, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
