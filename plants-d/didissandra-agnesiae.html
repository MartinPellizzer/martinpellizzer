                    <h1>Didissandra agnesiae</h1>
<p>Didissandra agnesiae, commonly known as the Agnesia sandstone fig, is a rare and endemic plant found in the quartzite outcrops of the Australian Central Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and related species, and is characterized by its unique morphological adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically eaten by local fauna, contributing to its ecological role in the region. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss and enabling survival in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Didissandra agnesiae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
