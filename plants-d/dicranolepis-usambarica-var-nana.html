                    <h1>Dicranolepis usambarica var. nana</h1>
<p>Dicranolepis usambarica var. nana, commonly known as the Usambara dwarf moss, is a rare and specialized fern found in the montane forests of the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or among decaying organic matter. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
