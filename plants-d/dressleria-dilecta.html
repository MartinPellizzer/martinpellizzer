                    <h1>Dressleria dilecta</h1>
<p>Dressleria dilecta, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal flowering make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Dressleria dilecta is also noted for its ability to produce pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients for periods of drought.</p>
