                    <h1>Dasysphaera lanata</h1>
<p>Dasysphaera lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in marshy or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
