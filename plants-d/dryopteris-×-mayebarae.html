<p>Dryopteris × mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is characterized by a dark green coloration and a velvety texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the natural habitat.</p>
