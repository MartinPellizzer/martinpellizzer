<p>Dryopteris magna, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
