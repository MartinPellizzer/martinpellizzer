                    <h1>Dryopteris barbigera var. falconeri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris barbigera var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri wood fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns, characterized by its distinctive fronds and habitat preferences.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a unique, toothed margin that gives it a rugged appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
