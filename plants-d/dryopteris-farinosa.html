                    <h1>Dryopteris farinosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris farinosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tall, sterile fronds that are covered in a fine, cinnamon-colored down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short, thick rhizome that supports its upright, arching fronds.</p>
<p>The fern produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in lines along the edges.</p>
