<p>Diflugossa filiformis, commonly known as the slender diflugossa, is a rare and delicate moss species belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its sporophytes are small and often inconspicuous, with capsules that release spores in a dispersed manner.</p>
<p>Diflugossa filiformis is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
