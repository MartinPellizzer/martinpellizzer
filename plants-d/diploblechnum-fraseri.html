<p>Diploblechnum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
