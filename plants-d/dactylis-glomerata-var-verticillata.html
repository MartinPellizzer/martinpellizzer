                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. verticillata, commonly known as the woolly cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the flowering spikes are arranged in a compact, cylindrical shape.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings for forage.</p>
