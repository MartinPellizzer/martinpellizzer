                            <h1>Daphne Laureola Var. Cantabrica</h1>
<p>Daphne laureola var. cantabrica is a rare and beautiful plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Daphne laureola. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
