<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rock crevices or under forest canopy. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
