<p>Dryopteris obtusissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and wiry, often covered with remnants of last season's fronds.</p>
