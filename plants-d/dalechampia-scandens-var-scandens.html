<p>Dalechampia scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
