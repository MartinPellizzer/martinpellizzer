<p>Dendrobium textile, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, wiry stems that often hang from trees, and its clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal soil. Its flowers typically bloom in summer and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Dendrobium textile is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright light and moderate watering to flourish.</p>
