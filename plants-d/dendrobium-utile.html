<p>Dendrobium utile, commonly known as the useful dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and are borne in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Dendrobium utile is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
