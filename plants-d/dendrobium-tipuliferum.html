<p>Dendrobium tipuliferum, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of thin, white bark.</p>
<p>Dendrobium tipuliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
