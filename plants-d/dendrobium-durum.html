                    <h1>Dendrobium durum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium durum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Dendrobium durum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
