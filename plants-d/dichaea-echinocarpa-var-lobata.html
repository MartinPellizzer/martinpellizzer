                    <h1>Dichaea echinocarpa var. lobata</h1>
<p>Dichaea echinocarpa var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate spikemoss, is a member of the family Lejeuneaceae and is characterized by its small, creeping stems and clustered, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Its morphology is adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on the surfaces of trees and rocks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lobed leaf shape, which sets it apart from other variants within the species.</p>
