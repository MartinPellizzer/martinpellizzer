<p>Disterigma pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as acacias, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are usually clustered and appear in the axils of the leaves.</p>
<p>Disterigma pachyphyllum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
