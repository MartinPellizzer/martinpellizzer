                    <h1>Dendrophthoe discolor</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe discolor, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its aerial roots attach to the host tree, allowing it to draw water and nutrients from the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthoe discolor plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
