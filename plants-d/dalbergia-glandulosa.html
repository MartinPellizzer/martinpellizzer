                    <h1>Dalbergia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Dalbergia glandulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legumes containing flattened seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its high value for woodworking, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns.</p>
