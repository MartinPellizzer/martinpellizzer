                    <h1>Dracaena stricta</h1>
<p>Dracaena stricta, commonly known as the "lucky bamboo," is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dark green, strap-like leaves that give it a striking, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by red or orange berries, though it is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Dracaena stricta is also valued in feng shui traditions for its supposed ability to bring good luck and positive energy.</p>
