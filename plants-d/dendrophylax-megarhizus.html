                    <h1>Dendrophylax megarhizus</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax megarhizus, commonly known as the giant root orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive root system, which can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, intricate structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
