<p>Ditassa decussata, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Ditassa decussata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
