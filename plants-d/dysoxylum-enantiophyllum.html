                    <h1>Dysoxylum enantiophyllum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum enantiophyllum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a distinctive root system with pneumatophores, which allow it to breathe in waterlogged soil. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
