                    <h1>Draba hirta var. inferalpina</h1>
<p>Draba hirta var. inferalpina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves that are densely hairy, giving it a woolly appearance, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
