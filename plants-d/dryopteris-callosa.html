<p>Dryopteris callosa, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves.</p>
