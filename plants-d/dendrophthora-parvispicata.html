                    <h1>Dendrophthora parvispicata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora parvispicata, commonly known as the small-spiked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the branches of specific host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, making it harmful to livestock and humans. Its leaves are usually scale-like and lack true stomata, adapting to its parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora parvispicata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees, influencing nutrient cycling and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
