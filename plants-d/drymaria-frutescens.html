                    <h1>Drymaria frutescens</h1>
<p>Drymaria frutescens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Drymaria frutescens is also known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
