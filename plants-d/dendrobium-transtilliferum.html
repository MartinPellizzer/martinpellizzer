                    <h1>Dendrobium transtilliferum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium transtilliferum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Dendrobium transtilliferum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
