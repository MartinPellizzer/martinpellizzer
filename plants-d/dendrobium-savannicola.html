<p>Dendrobium savannicola, commonly known as the savanna orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium savannicola thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
