                    <h1>Drosera gunniana</h1>
<p>Drosera gunniana, commonly known as the Gunner's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hair-like leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's small, white flowers are typically arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it blooms during the cooler months. Drosera gunniana thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in heathlands and on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey.</p>
