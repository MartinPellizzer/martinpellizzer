<p>Debia rosettifolia, commonly known as the rosette leaf plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette formation of fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Debia rosettifolia is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
