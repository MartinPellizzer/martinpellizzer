<p>Dryopteris heleopteroides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are shield-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of brownish or golden-colored scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically divided into narrow, linear segments.</p>
