<p>Dontostemon senilis subsp.</p>
<p>gubanovii, commonly known as the Gubanov's senile dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a slender, thread-like structure that allows it to spread easily. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
