                    <h1>Dracula marsupialis</h1>
<p>Dracula marsupialis, commonly known as the "Marsupial Dragon" or "Red Dragon," is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange petals, which resemble the scales of a dragon, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers are highly specialized, with long, slender petals that curl backward, aiding in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Dracula marsupialis is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
