                    <h1>Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. psychrophila</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. psychrophila, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a rare and cold-adapted orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as peat bogs and mountain marshes. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive lip. Its growth is closely tied to specific microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
