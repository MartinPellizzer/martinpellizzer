                    <h1>Dockrillia mortii</h1>
<p>Dockrillia mortii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the dense, shaded understories of temperate forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of ancient manuscripts. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dockrillia mortii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
