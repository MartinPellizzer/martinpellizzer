<p>Distichlis deserticola, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Distichlis deserticola is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife.</p>
