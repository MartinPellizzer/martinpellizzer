                    <h1>Dendrophorbium lloense</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium lloense, commonly known as the Lloense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
