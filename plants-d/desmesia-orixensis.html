<p>Desmesia orixensis, commonly known as the Orixes rock orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the mountainous regions of Orixes, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricately patterned flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the high-altitude climate with cool temperatures and ample sunlight. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
