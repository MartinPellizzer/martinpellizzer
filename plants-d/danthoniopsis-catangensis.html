<p>Danthoniopsis catangensis, commonly known as the Catangensis muirgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded grassland areas.</p>
