                    <h1>Dispermotheca viscosa var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Dispermotheca viscosa var. alpestris, commonly known as the sticky dispersotheca, is a variant of the Dispermotheca viscosa species.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to alpine regions, characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a notable botanical feature, possibly serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments, exhibiting a slow growth rate and a low, mat-like growth form.</p>
