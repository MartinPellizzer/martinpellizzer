<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, purple, and violet hues. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
