                    <h1>Dracontium dubium</h1>
<p>Dracontium dubium, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, often with a waxy, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its unique leaf structure allows it to capture moisture from the air, making it well adapted to humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracontium dubium is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
