<p>Diplusodon helianthemifolius var. pemphoides, commonly known as the coastal helianthemum, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
