                    <h1>Deyeuxia spiciformis</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia spiciformis, commonly known as the spike-form grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it reproduces through rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia spiciformis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
