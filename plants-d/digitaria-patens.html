                    <h1>Digitaria patens</h1>
<p>Digitaria patens, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Digitaria patens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
