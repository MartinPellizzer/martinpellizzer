<p>Daemonorops margaritae, commonly known as the pearl fern, is a species of cycad that is native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops margaritae is considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
