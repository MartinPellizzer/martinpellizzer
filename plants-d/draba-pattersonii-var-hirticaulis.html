                    <h1>Draba pattersonii var. hirticaulis</h1>
<p>Draba pattersonii var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy stalked whitlow grass, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is considered rare and is often found in specific habitats such as talus slopes and meadows.</p>
