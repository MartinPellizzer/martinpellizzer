<p>Desmodium varians, commonly known as the variable desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, and it is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Desmodium varians has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
