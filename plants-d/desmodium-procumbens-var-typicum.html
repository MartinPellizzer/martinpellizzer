<p>Desmodium procumbens var. typicum, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
