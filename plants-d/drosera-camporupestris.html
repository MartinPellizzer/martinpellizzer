                    <h1>Drosera camporupestris</h1>
<p>Drosera camporupestris, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions.</p>
<p>Drosera camporupestris is a relatively small species, often reaching only a few inches in height, but it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
