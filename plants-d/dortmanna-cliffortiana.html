                <h1>Dortmanna cliffortiana</h1>
<p>Dortmanna cliffortiana, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the shorelines. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Dortmanna cliffortiana plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
