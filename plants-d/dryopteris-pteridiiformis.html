<p>Dryopteris pteridiiformis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a serrated edge. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
