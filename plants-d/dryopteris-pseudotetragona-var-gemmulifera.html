                    <h1>Dryopteris pseudotetragona var. gemmulifera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pseudotetragona var. gemmulifera, commonly known as the gemmule-bearing wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. The plant produces gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and propagation.</p>
