<p>It is primarily found in agricultural regions where its host plants include wheat, barley, and other grasses. The adult stage feeds on nectar, while the larvae develop inside the flower heads, feeding on developing seeds. This pest can significantly impact crop yields by reducing seed quality and quantity.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth stages of its host plants, making it a challenging pest to manage in cereal crops.</p>
