                    <h1>Dryopteris oreopteris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oreopteris, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically clustered in groups.</p>
