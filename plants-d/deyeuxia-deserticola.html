<p>Deyeuxia deserticola, commonly known as the desert couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia deserticola plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
