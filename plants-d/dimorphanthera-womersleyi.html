                    <h1>Dimorphanthera womersleyi</h1>
<p>Dimorphanthera womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, slender stems and pale, translucent flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within rainforests, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited distribution, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
