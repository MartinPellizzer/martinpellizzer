                    <h1>Dischidia nummularia var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Dischidia nummularia var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular dischidia, is a compact, trailing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by bean-like seed pods. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
