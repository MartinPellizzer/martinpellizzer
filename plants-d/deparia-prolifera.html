                    <h1>Deparia prolifera</h1>
<p>Deparia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically triangular in cross-section and have a distinctive, somewhat wiry texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to reproduce both sexually through spores and asexually through rhizome fragmentation.</p>
