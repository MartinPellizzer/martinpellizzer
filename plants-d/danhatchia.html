                    <h1>Danhatchia</h1>
<p>Danhatchia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are usually small and strap-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its mycorrhizal associations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Danhatchia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
