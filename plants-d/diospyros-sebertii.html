<p>Diospyros sebertii, commonly known as the African persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other well-known species like ebony and persimmon. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature and is edible, though often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The wood of Diospyros sebertii is hard and dense, making it valuable for carving and crafting.</p>
