<p>Dendrobium elineae, commonly known as the Elinea orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium elineae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
