<p>Deparia forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
