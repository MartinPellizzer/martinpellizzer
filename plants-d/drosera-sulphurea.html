                    <h1>Drosera sulphurea</h1>
<p>Drosera sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a yellowish digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Drosera sulphurea is well adapted to its environment, using both photosynthesis and insect prey to obtain essential nutrients.</p>
