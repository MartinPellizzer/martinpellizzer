<p>Diplazium viridissimum, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
