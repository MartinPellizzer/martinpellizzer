                    <h1>Dryopteris nigrovenia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nigrovenia, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The distinctive black veins in its leaves give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
