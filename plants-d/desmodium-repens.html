                    <h1>Desmodium repens</h1>
<p>Desmodium repens, commonly known as creeping sicklepod, is a low-growing annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often spreading along the ground through its stolons. Its small, lens-shaped pods contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Desmodium repens is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
