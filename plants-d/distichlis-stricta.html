                    <h1>Distichlis stricta</h1>
<p>Distichlis stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and windy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is valued for erosion control and as a component of native plant landscapes.</p>
