<p>Dioscorea orbiculata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically thin and delicate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are edible when properly prepared. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend supports, making it suitable for trellises or shaded areas.</p>
<p>The tubers of this variety are often used in traditional cuisines and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
