                    <h1>Danthonia borussica</h1>
<p>Danthonia borussica, commonly known as the slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
