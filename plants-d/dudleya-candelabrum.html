<p>Dudleya candelabrum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
