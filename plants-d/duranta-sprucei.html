<p>Duranta sprucei, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which are followed by blue or purple berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms.</p>
<p>Duranta sprucei is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in suitable climates.</p>
