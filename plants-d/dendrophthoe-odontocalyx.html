                    <h1>Dendrophthoe odontocalyx</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe odontocalyx, commonly known as the toothed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host species.</p>
