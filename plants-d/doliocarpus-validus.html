                    <h1>Doliocarpus validus</h1>
<p>Doliocarpus validus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>The tree plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
