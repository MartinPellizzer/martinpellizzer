                    <h1>Dyckia maritima</h1>
<p>Dyckia maritima, commonly known as the sea dyckia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dyckia maritima is well adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
