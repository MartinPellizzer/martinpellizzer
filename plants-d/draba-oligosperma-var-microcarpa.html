                    <h1>Draba oligosperma var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Draba oligosperma var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The variety microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form.</p>
