                    <h1>Desmodium incanum</h1>
<p>Desmodium incanum, commonly known as hairy burr legume, is a perennial forage plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Desmodium incanum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
