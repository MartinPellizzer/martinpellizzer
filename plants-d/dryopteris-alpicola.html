<p>Dryopteris alpicola, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris alpicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
