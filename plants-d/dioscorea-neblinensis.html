<p>Dioscorea neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's yam, is a climbing vine native to the humid lowland forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and morphological features make it well adapted to the understory environments of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
