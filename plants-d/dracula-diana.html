<p>Dracula diana, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Brazil.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of deep red and purple. Dracula diana is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a highly sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
