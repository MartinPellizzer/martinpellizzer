                    <h1>Daphnitis madagascarensis</h1>
<p>Daphnitis madagascarensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water lily, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in shallow waters and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Daphnitis madagascarensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
