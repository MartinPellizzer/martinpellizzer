                    <h1>Digera arvensis</h1>
<p>Digera arvensis, commonly known as field scurvygrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a fibrous root system that helps it establish quickly. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread efficiently.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
