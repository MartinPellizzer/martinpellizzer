                            <h1>Decamerium Brachycerum</h1>
<p>Common sunflower, scientifically known as Decamerium brachycerum, is a striking plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow flower heads that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its unique ability to track sunlight makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and a symbol of resilience. Despite its common name, Decamerium brachycerum is a rare and fascinating plant that showcases nature's adaptability.</p>
