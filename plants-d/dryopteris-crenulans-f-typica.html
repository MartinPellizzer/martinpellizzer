<p>Dryopteris crenulans f. typica, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are often covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, making it a visually striking addition to woodland gardens.</p>
