<p>Dyckia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, showy white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare plants.</p>
