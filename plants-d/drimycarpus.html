                    <h1>Drimycarpus</h1>
<p>Drimycarpus, commonly known as the "bushy ironwood," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. They are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Drimycarpus species are also notable for their hard, woody fruits, which contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, sometimes edible, pulp.</p>
