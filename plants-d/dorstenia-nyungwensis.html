<p>Dorstenia nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe starvine, is a rare and unique species native to the montane rainforests of Rwanda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant is a climbing vine with fleshy, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
