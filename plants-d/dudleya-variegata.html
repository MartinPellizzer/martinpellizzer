<p>Dudleya variegata, commonly known as the variegated liveforever, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or pink markings, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a decorative plant in arid landscapes.</p>
