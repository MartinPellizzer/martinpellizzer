<p>Diplazium asterothrix, commonly known as the star-hair fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a soft, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
