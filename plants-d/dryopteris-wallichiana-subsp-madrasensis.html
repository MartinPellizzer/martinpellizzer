<p>Dryopteris wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>madrasensis, commonly known as the Madras maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
