                    <h1>Dondia taxifolia</h1>
<p>Dondia taxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which aid in attachment to host plants. It is native to parts of Africa and is commonly found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves producing copious amounts of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
