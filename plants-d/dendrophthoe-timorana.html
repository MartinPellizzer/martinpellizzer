                    <h1>Dendrophthoe timorana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe timorana, commonly known as the Timor mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily from the genus Eucalyptus, using a specialized haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe timorana plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various insects and birds, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
