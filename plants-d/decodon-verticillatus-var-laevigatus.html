                    <h1>Decodon verticillatus var. laevigatus</h1>
<p>Decodon verticillatus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth false water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Decodon verticillatus.</p>
