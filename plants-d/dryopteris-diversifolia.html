                    <h1>Dryopteris diversifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris diversifolia, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that vary in size and shape, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
