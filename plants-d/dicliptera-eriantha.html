                    <h1>Dicliptera eriantha</h1>
<p>Dicliptera eriantha, commonly known as the woolly blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in wet or seasonally flooded soils.</p>
<p>Dicliptera eriantha is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
