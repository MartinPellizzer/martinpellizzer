                    <h1>Dimorpha</h1>
<p>Dimorpha, commonly known as the two-faced plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features two distinct faces or lobes on each flower. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with aromatic leaves that have a resinous scent. Dimorpha species are often found in coastal or sandy soils, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely commercially grown.</p>
