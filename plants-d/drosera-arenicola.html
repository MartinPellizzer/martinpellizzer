                    <h1>Drosera arenicola</h1>
<p>Drosera arenicola, commonly known as the sand pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, sticky glands on its leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap and digest insects. Its unique morphology includes a rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that form a trap-like structure.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to soil nutrient cycling.</p>
