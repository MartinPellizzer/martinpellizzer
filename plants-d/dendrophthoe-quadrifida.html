                    <h1>Dendrophthoe quadrifida</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe quadrifida, commonly known as the Indian ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic vine native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-free stems for photosynthesis. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as mango and neem, through haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its dispersal by animals.</p>
