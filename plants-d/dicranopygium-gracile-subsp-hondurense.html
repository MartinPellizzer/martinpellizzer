<p>Dicranopygium gracile subsp.</p>
<p>hondurense, commonly known as the Honduran slender moss, is a member of the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>The plant has a delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and closely arranged leaves. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a capsule that is often curved and covered in a thick, dark peristome.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences.</p>
