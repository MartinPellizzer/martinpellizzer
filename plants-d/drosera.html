                    <h1>Drosera</h1>
<p>Drosera, commonly known as the sundew, is a genus of carnivorous plants characterized by their sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects.</p>
<p>These hairs secrete a sugary substance that attracts and immobilizes prey. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette, allowing for efficient moisture retention and prey capture. Drosera species are found in various habitats, including bogs and heathlands, where they thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Their unique adaptations make them fascinating subjects for both ecological study and botanical appreciation.</p>
