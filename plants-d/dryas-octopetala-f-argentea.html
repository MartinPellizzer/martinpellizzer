<p>Dryas octopetala f. argentea, commonly known as the silver-leaved mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its silver-blue foliage due to dense, fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
