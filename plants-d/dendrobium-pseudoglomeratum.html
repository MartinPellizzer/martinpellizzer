<p>Dendrobium pseudoglomeratum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
