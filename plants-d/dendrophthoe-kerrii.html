                    <h1>Dendrophthoe kerrii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that connect to the host's vascular system. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe kerrii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
