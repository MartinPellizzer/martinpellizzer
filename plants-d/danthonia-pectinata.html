<p>Danthonia pectinata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft-textured leaves and dense, low-growing habit, often forming mats on the ground. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Danthonia pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
