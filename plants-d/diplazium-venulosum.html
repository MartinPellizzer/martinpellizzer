                <h1>Diplazium venulosum</h1>
<p>Diplazium venulosum, commonly known as the veined staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to trees or other surfaces. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium venulosum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
