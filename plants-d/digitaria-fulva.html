                    <h1>Digitaria fulva</h1>
<p>Digitaria fulva, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other native grasses in restoration projects.</p>
<p>Digitaria fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological landscapes.</p>
