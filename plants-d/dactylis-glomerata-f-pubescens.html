                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent couch grass, is a variant of the common couch grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its "pubescent" appearance. It is widely used in pastureland and for erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>This form is particularly notable for its adaptability and resilience in temperate climates.</p>
