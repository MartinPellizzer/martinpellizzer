                    <h1>Digitalis dubia f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Digitalis dubia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender foxglove, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, typically purple or pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender, erect growth habit and smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other Digitalis species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>
