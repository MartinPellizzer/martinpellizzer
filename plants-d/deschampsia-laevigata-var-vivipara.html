                    <h1>Deschampsia laevigata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Deschampsia laevigata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist to wet habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. One distinguishing feature is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow independently, aiding in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
