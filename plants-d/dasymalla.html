                    <h1>Dasymalla</h1>
<p>Dasymalla, commonly known as the "buttercup tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Dasymalla armata and Dasymalla flava, both native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, hence the common name. They are shrubs or small trees with palmately lobed leaves and produce capsule fruits.</p>
<p>Dasymalla species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
