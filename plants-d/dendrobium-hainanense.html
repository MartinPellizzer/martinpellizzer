                    <h1>Dendrobium hainanense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered with a layer of white or yellowish tissue, known as a pseudobulb. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
