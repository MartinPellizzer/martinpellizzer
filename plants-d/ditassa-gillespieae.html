                    <h1>Ditassa gillespieae</h1>
<p>Ditassa gillespieae, commonly known as the Gillespie's ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Texas.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with small, succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It is particularly notable for its ephemeral nature, with its flowers appearing briefly before quickly fading.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
