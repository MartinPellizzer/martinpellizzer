<p>Diplazium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Diplazium fimbriatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
