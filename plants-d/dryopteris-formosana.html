                    <h1>Dryopteris formosana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris formosana, commonly known as the Formosan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape and a dark green color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
