<p>Diplazium glingense, commonly known as the Glinge's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium glingense plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
