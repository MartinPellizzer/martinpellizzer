<p>Dryopteris punctata subsp.</p>
<p>rugosula, commonly known as the rough serrated wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and have a rough, serrated texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes.</p>
