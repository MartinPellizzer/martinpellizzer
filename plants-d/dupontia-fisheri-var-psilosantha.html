                    <h1>Dupontia fisheri var. psilosantha</h1>
<p>Dupontia fisheri var. psilosantha, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a rare plant species native to the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal dunes and shorelines. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray, strong winds, and fluctuating moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
