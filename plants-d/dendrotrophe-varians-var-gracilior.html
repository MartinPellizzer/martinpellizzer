                    <h1>Dendrotrophe varians var. gracilior</h1>
<p>Dendrotrophe varians var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender variegated tree fern, is a rare and striking member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, gracefully arching fronds that display a unique variegation pattern of light and dark green. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soils. Its growth is slow, making it a prized specimen for botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
