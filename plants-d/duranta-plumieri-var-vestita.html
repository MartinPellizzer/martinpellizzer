<p>Duranta plumieri var. vestita, commonly known as the silver duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its clusters of blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'vestita' distinguishes it from other duranta species by its unique leaf coloration.</p>
