                    <h1>Delphinium calcicola</h1>
<p>Delphinium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Delphinium calcicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
