<p>Diclytra formosa, commonly known as the golden tortoise beetle, is a species of leaf beetle characterized by its striking metallic green and yellow coloration.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chrysomelidae and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant it feeds on, primarily species of the genus Eupatorium, provides both food and habitat for the beetle.
