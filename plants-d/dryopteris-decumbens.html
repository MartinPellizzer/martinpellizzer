<p>Dryopteris decumbens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that spread horizontally along the ground. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
