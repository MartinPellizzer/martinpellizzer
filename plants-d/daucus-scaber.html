                    <h1>Daucus scaber</h1>
<p>Daucus scaber, commonly known as rough carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and celery. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot.</p>
<p>Daucus scaber is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions.</p>
