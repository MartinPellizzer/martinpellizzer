<p>Disa outeniquensis, commonly known as the Outeniqua orchid, is a striking South African orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is a symbol of the region's rich floral diversity.</p>
