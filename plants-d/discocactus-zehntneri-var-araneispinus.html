                    <h1>Discocactus zehntneri var. araneispinus</h1>
<p>Discocactus zehntneri var. araneispinus, commonly known as the spider-tailed cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, long, thin stems that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact form make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
