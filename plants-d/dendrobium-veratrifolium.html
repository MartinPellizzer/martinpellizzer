<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple stems and leaves. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in hardwood forests.</p>
