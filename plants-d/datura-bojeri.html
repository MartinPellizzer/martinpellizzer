<p>Datura bojeri, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces large, showy trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale lavender in color. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Datura bojeri is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids.</p>
