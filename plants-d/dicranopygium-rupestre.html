                    <h1>Dicranopygium rupestre</h1>
<p>Dicranopygium rupestre, commonly known as the rock moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and intricate leaf structure. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained substrates, often on limestone or sandstone. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leafy thallus, typical of many liverworts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability.</p>
