<p>Desmoncus uaxactunensis, commonly known as the Yucatán orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water, adapting it to the arid environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the limestone soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
