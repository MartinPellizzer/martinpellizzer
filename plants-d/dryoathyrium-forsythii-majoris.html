<p>Dryoathyrium forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the yellow moss or golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and bright yellow to golden-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoids. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
