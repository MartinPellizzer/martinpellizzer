<p>Distichlis sudanensis, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a halophytic grass native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and drought. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important species for coastal stabilization.</p>
<p>Distichlis sudanensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
