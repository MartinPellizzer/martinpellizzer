<p>Destrugesia scabrida, commonly known as the rough desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, scabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Destrugesia scabrida plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
