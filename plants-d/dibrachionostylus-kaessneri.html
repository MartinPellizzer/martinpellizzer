                    <h1>Dibrachionostylus kaessneri</h1>
<p>Dibrachionostylus kaessneri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in specialized microhabitats.</p>
