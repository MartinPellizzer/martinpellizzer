                    <h1>Diasperus subemarginatus</h1>
<p>Diasperus subemarginatus, commonly known as the narrow-margin rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
