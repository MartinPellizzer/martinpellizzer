<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Diaperia verna is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
