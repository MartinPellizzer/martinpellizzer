                    <h1>Dendrobium palmerstoniae</h1>
<p>Dendrobium palmerstoniae, commonly known as the Palmerston's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or greyish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers with a distinct yellow throat, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
