<p>Diplocaulobium dendrocolla, commonly known as the tree-attached liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically attached to tree bark or other moist surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces, often featuring intricate patterns of cells and canals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, commonly found in temperate and tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it plays a role in ecological succession and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
