<p>Drosera peltata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or wetland habitats, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a dense covering of glandular hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by botanists and collectors for its unique appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition.</p>
