<p>Daemonorops fusca, commonly known as the red-veined cycad, is a member of the palm family, Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive reddish veining. Its cycad-like appearance often leads to confusion with true cycads, but it is classified as a palm.</p>
<p>Daemonorops fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
