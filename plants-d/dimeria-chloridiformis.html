<p>Dimeria chloridiformis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance with fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Dimeria chloridiformis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
