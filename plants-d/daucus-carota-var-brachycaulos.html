<p>Daucus carota var. brachycaulos, commonly known as the globe carrot, is a cultivated variant of the wild carrot.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stocky root structure and a more compact growth habit compared to the standard carrot. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. It is primarily grown for its edible, orange-colored root, which is rich in beta-carotene.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for cooler climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
