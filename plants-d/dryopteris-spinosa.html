                    <h1>Dryopteris spinosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The rhizomes of Dryopteris spinosa are often thick and wiry, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
