                    <h1>Drosera lunata</h1>
<p>Drosera lunata, commonly known as the moonflower sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths. Its growth is typically low to the ground, with a compact form that helps it thrive in moist, acidic environments.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique nocturnal blooming habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
