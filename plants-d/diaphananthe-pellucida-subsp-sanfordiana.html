<p>Diaphananthe pellucida subsp.</p>
<p>sanfordiana, commonly known as the Sanford's ghostplant, is a rare aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor wetlands. It possesses delicate, translucent leaves that float on the water surface, often appearing almost ethereal in appearance.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are wiry and anchor it to muddy substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered in small, compact clusters. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients directly through its leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it plays a unique role in its wetland ecosystem.</p>
