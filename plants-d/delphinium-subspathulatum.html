                    <h1>Delphinium subspathulatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
