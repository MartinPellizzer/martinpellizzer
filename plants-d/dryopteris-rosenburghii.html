                    <h1>Dryopteris rosenburghii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rosenburghii, commonly known as the Rosenburgh's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
