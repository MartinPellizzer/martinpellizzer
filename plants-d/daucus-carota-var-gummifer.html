                    <h1>Daucus carota var. gummifer</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. gummifer, commonly known as the gummed carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot species characterized by its distinctive, fleshy root that secretes a sticky, resinous substance.</p>
<p>This unique trait is due to the presence of specialized glands on the root surface, which produce a gum-like exudate. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong aromatic scent, while the flowers are white and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique chemical composition.</p>
