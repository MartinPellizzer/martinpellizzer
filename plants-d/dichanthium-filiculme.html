<p>Dichanthium filiculme, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Dichanthium filiculme plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
