<p>Dryopteris hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pale green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
