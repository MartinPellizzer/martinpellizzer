<p>Dupatya oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's papyrus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by hollow, spongy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots help stabilize the sediment in shallow waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
