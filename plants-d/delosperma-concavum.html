<p>Delosperma concavum, commonly known as the concave-flowered ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Delosperma concavum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
