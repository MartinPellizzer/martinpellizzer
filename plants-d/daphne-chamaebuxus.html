                    <h1>Daphne chamaebuxus</h1>
<p>Daphne chamaebuxus, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the winter, providing visual interest during the colder months. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
