                    <h1>Dryopteris separabilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris separabilis, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant's name derives from its tendency to curl or fold its fronds when touched, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new plants through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
