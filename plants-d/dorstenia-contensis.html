<p>Dorstenia contensis, commonly known as the "tropical orchid vine," is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dorstenia contensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to climb or trail.</p>
