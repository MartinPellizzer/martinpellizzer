                    <h1>Dryopteris lonchitis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lonchitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
