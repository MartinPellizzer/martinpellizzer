<p>Deparia petersenii subsp.</p>
<p>petersenii, commonly known as the Petersen's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
