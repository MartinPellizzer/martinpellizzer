<p>Drypetes keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island flamewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal and tropical dry forest habitats, often growing in sandy or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
