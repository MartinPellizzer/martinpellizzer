                    <h1>Dyscritogyne dryophila</h1>
<p>Dyscritogyne dryophila, commonly known as the dry soil dyscritogyne, is a rare and specialized plant species found in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils through a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dyscritogyne dryophila is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native regions.</p>
