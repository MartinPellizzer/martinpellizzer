<p>Drynaria tridactyla, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to vertical surfaces.</p>
<p>Drynaria tridactyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for use in traditional medicine.</p>
