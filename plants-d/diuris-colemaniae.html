<p>Diuris colemaniae, commonly known as the Crimson Rock Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, hairy rhizome with a single, erect, grass-like leaf. The plant produces a spike of 5â€“10 bright red or orange-red flowers, each with a distinctive, spurred labellum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
