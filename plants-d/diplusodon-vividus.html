<p>Diplusodon vividus, commonly known as the vivid ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and strikingly colorful flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers, which bloom in vibrant hues of pink and purple, are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Diplusodon vividus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
