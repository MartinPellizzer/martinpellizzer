                    <h1>Dendrotrophe umbellata var. umbellata</h1>
<p>Dendrotrophe umbellata var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on tree bark.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, umbrella-shaped lobes that give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the trunks of coniferous trees in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind and contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator of air quality and plays a role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
