                    <h1>Deparia mcdonellii</h1>
<p>Deparia mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonnell's wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
