                    <h1>Dendrocolla brunnescens</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla brunnescens, commonly known as the brown wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark brown to reddish-brown thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algal component providing photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches, especially in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for forest health.</p>
