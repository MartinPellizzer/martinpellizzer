<p>Delpya cochinchinensis, commonly known as the floating water clover, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, four-lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Delpya cochinchinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
