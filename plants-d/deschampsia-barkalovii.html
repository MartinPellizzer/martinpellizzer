<p>Deschampsia barkalovii, commonly known as the Barkalov's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Deschampsia barkalovii is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
