<p>Diplotaxis humilis subsp.</p>
<p>saxatilis, commonly known as the rock wall lettuce, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments in southern Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
