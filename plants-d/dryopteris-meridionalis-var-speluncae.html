                    <h1>Dryopteris meridionalis var. speluncae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris meridionalis var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, relying on moisture and mineral-rich substrates for nutrient uptake. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered an endangered species and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
