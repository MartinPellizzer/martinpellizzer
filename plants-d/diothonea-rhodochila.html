<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
