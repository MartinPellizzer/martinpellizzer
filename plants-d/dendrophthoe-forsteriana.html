                    <h1>Dendrophthoe forsteriana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe forsteriana, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host trees, drawing nutrients and water from them.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for sustenance, making it a hemiparasite. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish and are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its parasitic nature makes it a subject of ecological interest.</p>
