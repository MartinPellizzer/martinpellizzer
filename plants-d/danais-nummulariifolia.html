                    <h1>Danais nummulariifolia</h1>
<p>Danais nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
