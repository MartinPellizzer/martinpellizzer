<p>Deparia pterorachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are often divided into multiple pinnae. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
