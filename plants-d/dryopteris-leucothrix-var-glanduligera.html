<p>Dryopteris leucothrix var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the silverwood fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant features small, glandular hairs on its leaves, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, dying back in winter and regrowing in the spring.</p>
