                    <h1>Davallia polypodioides var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Davallia polypodioides var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, and lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, cascading form. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'subglabra' refers to its smoother leaf surface compared to other varieties of Davallia.</p>
