<p>Daucus communis subsp.</p>
<p>bocconei, commonly known as the Boccone's cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less common than the widespread D. communis and is of interest to botanists due to its distinct ecological preferences and morphological traits.</p>
