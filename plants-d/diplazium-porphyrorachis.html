                    <h1>Diplazium porphyrorachis</h1>
<p>Diplazium porphyrorachis, commonly known as the purple-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often tinged with a purple hue, particularly along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
