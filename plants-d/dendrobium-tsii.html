<p>Dendrobium tsii, commonly known as the Tsai's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium tsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes.</p>
