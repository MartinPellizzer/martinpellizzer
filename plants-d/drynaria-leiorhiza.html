                    <h1>Drynaria leiorhiza</h1>
<p>Drynaria leiorhiza, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest environments, preferring humid and cool conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
