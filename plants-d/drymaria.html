                    <h1>Drymaria</h1>
<p>Drymaria, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Drymaria is known for its ability to form dense mats, making it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecosystems.</p>
