<p>Dactylorhiza bithynica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome and a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens, often in areas with high moisture and low light conditions.</p>
<p>Dactylorhiza bithynica is known for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake in its nutrient-poor environment.</p>
