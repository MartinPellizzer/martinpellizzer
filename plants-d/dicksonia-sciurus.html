                    <h1>Dicksonia sciurus</h1>
<p>Dicksonia sciurus, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Dicksonia sciurus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
