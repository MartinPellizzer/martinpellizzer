<p>Disperis bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Disperis bosseri is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid diversity in tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
