                    <h1>Dendrobium sphegidoglossum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sphegidoglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a yellow or golden color and a lip that is often curled or twisted. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the diverse orchid flora of its native region.</p>
