                    <h1>Diora</h1>
<p>Diora, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Diora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
