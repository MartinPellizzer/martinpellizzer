<p>Dortmanna triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triquetrous (three-angled) stems and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Dortmanna triquetra plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
