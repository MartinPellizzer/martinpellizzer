<p>Diplachne pallida, commonly known as slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Diplachne pallida thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
