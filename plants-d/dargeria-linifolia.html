                    <h1>Dargeria linifolia</h1>
<p>Dargeria linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dargeria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
