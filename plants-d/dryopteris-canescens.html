                    <h1>Dryopteris canescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris canescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered with a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while also storing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
