                    <h1>Donax australis</h1>
<p>Donax australis, commonly known as the Australian sea holly, is a coastal shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found along shorelines. Its flowers are composed of showy bracts rather than true petals, and it is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>Donax australis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
