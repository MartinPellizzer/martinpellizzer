<p>Dracocephalum fruticulosum subsp.</p>
<p>psammophilum, commonly known as sand-loving blueweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, narrow leaves adapted to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.</p>
