                    <h1>Dryopteris effusa var. confinis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris effusa var. confinis, commonly known as the Pacific Shield Fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the underside of its fertile fronds, which develop in late summer.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
