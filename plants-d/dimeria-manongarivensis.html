<p>Dimeria manongarivensis, commonly known as the Manongarivensis dimeria, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick,肉质 leaves. It produces a distinctive type of fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dimeria manongarivensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
