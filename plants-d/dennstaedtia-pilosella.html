<p>Dennstaedtia pilosella, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
