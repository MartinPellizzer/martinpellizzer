<p>Drosera filiformis var. tracyi, commonly known as the Tracy's Sundew, is a variant of the common sundew species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, carnivorous plant that thrives in wet, boggy environments, using its sticky, glandular leaves to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral touch to its appearance. Its leaves are long and thin, often curling around captured prey to enhance digestion.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and ecological adaptability.</p>
