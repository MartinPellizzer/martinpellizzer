                    <h1>Diplaziopsis heterophlebia</h1>
<p>Diplaziopsis heterophlebia, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that exhibit a distinct variation in pinnae size and shape along the length of the frond. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the abaxial surface of the pinnae.</p>
<p>The variability in its frond morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
