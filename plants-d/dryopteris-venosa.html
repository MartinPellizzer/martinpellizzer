<p>Dryopteris venosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery sheen due to the presence of small, scale-like structures on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Dryopteris venosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance.</p>
