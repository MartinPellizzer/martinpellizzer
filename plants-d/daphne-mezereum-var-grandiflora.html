                    <h1>Daphne mezereum var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Daphne mezereum var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered mezereon, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, though it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
