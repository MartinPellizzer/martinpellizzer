                    <h1>Douglasia nivalis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Douglasia nivalis var. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous snow Douglasia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along mountain slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its frost tolerance and ability to bloom even in harsh winter conditions.</p>
