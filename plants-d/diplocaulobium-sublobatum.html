<p>Diplocaulobium sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cabomidiaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
