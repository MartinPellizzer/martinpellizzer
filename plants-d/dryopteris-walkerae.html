                    <h1>Dryopteris walkerae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris walkerae, commonly known as the Walkera's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
