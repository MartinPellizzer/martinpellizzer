<p>It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danaea alansmithii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
