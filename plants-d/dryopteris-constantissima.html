<p>Dryopteris constantissima, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically unbranched and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
