                    <h1>Dendrophthora negeriana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora negeriana, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora negeriana plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
