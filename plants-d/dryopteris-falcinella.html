<p>Dryopteris falcinella, commonly known as the narrow fern or the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Dryopteris falcinella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its elegant, fern-like appearance.</p>
