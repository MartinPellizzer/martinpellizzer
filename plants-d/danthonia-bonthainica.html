                    <h1>Danthonia bonthainica</h1>
<p>Danthonia bonthainica, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a grass species native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of dune and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
