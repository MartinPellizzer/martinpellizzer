<p>Dryopteris prionites, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
