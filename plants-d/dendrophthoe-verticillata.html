                    <h1>Dendrophthoe verticillata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe verticillata, commonly known as the Indian milk bush, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish or greenish flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and can thrive on a variety of host species.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
