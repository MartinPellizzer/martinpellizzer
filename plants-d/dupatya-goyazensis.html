<p>Dupatya goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
