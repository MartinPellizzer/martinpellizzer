                    <h1>Danthonia carphoides var. angustior</h1>
<p>Danthonia carphoides var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
