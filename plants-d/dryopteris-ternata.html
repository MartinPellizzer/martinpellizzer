                    <h1>Dryopteris ternata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ternata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, arching pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance.</p>
