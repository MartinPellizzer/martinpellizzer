                    <h1>Desmonema fragosum</h1>
<p>Desmonema fragosum, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Desmonema fragosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
