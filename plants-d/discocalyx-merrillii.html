<p>Discocalyx merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, typical of cycads. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
