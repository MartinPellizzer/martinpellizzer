                    <h1>Dendrochilum occultum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum occultum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrochilum occultum is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often found in specialized botanical collections.</p>
