                    <h1>Draba physocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba physocarpa, commonly known as the bladderleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a powdery coating, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Draba physocarpa is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
