<p>Dyckia elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, forming a rosette structure. The plant produces striking, spiky flower spikes that can reach heights of over six feet, often with vibrant red or orange bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique architectural form.</p>
