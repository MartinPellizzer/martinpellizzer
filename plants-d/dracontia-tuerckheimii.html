                    <h1>Dracontia tuerckheimii</h1>
<p>Dracontia tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to trees without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracontia tuerckheimii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
