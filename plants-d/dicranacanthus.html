                    <h1>Dicranacanthus</h1>
<p>Dicranacanthus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often intricately branched fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually small, with a distinctive zigzag or undulating pattern along their margins.</p>
<p>Dicranacanthus species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic.</p>
