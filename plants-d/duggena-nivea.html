                    <h1>Duggena nivea</h1>
<p>Duggena nivea, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, creating a striking visual contrast against its silvery-green foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine displays. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Duggena nivea is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
