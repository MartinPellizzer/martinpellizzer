                    <h1>Deiregynopsis</h1>
<p>Deiregynopsis, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Deiregynopsis thrives in specific, moist, acidic habitats such as pine rocklands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
