                    <h1>Davallia multiflora</h1>
<p>Davallia multiflora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple upright shoots, contributing to its clumping growth habit.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens.</p>
