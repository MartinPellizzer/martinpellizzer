<p>Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the silky grass or narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, open panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
