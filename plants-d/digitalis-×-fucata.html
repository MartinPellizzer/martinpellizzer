                    <h1>Digitalis × fucata</h1>
<p>Digitalis × fucata, commonly known as the hybrid foxglove, is a perennial plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Digitalis purpurea (common foxglove) and Digitalis ferruginea (woolly foxglove), resulting in a plant with distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers typically range in color from pink to purple and are arranged in spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though its cardiac glycosides make it toxic if ingested.</p>
