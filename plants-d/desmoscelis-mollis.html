<p>Desmoscelis mollis, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive lobed shape, while the stems can root at the nodes, allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Desmoscelis mollis is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
