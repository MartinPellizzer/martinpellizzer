                    <h1>Desmanthus</h1>
<p>Desmanthus, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Desmanthus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Many species are nitrogen-fixing, making them valuable for soil enrichment and as forage crops.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in poor soils and its ecological benefits contribute to its importance in both agricultural and natural settings.</p>
