                    <h1>Dendrobium incurvum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium incurvum, commonly known as the curved lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a cane-like stem with numerous pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive, curving lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium incurvum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
