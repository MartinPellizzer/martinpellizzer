                <h1>Diphelypaea tournefortii</h1>
<p>Diphelypaea tournefortii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and rhizomatous growth pattern. The plant features small, delicate fronds with a pinnate structure, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Diphelypaea tournefortii thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
