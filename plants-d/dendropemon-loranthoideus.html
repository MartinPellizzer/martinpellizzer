                    <h1>Dendropemon loranthoideus</h1>
<p>Dendropemon loranthoideus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows as a holoparasite on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using modified leaves called phyllodes. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
