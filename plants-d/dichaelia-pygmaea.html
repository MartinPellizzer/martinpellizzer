                    <h1>Dichaelia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Dichaelia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf dichaelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaelia pygmaea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
