<p>Diplazium paleaceum var. spiniperisporeum, commonly known as the spiny-spore fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered with small, spiny structures, giving it its common name. Its spores are notably spinose, which aids in their dispersal and attachment to surfaces.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
