                    <h1>Dicraeia pterophylla</h1>
<p>Dicraeia pterophylla, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pouteria*.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
