                    <h1>Distichlis scoparia f. erinacea</h1>
<p>Distichlis scoparia f. erinacea, commonly known as the woolly saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
