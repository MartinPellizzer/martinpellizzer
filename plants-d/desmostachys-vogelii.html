<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, tall, columnar growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that are typically found at the tips of its branches. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of conifers in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
