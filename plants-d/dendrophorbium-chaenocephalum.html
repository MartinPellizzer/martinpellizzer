<p>Dendrophorbium chaenocephalum, commonly known as the red-headed tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red to orange upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is of interest to both botanists and conservationists.</p>
