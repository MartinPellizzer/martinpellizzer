<p>Dryopteris pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this fern make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
