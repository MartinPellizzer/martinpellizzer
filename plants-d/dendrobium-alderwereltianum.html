<p>Dendrobium alderwereltianum, commonly known as the Alderwerelt's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors from white to pink, and are often fragrant.</p>
<p>It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
