                    <h1>Dendrochilum heptaphyllum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum heptaphyllum, commonly known as the seven-leaved tree orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, branched inflorescence and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
