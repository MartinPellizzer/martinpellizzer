<p>Diosma hyponeura, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Diosma hyponeura is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
