                    <h1>Declieuxia oenanthoides var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Declieuxia oenanthoides var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in wetland ecosystem stability and water filtration.</p>
