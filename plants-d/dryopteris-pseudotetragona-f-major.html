                    <h1>Dryopteris pseudotetragona f. major</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pseudotetragona f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, rounded pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and acidic soil.</p>
