<p>Diplazium gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori.</p>
