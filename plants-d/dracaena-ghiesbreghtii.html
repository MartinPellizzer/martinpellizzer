                    <h1>Dracaena ghiesbreghtii</h1>
<p>Dracaena ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's dragon tree, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Dracaena ghiesbreghtii is also noted for its ability to produce red sap, which is similar to that of other dracaena species.</p>
