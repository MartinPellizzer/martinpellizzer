                    <h1>Draba bryoides var. squarrosa</h1>
<p>Draba bryoides var. squarrosa, commonly known as the cushion draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provides protection against desiccation and frost.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
