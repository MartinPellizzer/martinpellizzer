<p>Dryopteris ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
