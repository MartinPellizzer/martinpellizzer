<p>Desmodium akoense, commonly known as African velvetbean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Desmodium akoense thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields.</p>
