<p>Dryopteris jenmanii var. vincentis, commonly known as Vincent's wood fern, is a variant of the Jenman's wood fern, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
