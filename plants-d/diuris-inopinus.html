<p>Diuris inopinus, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike that bears several small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Diuris inopinus is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
