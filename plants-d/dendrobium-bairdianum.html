                    <h1>Dendrobium bairdianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium bairdianum, commonly known as the Baird's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters during the wet season.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bairdianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
