                    <h1>Dieteria canescens var. ziegleri</h1>
<p>Dieteria canescens var. ziegleri, commonly known as the Ziegler's desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, fleshy stem with a spiny, star-like appearance, adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
