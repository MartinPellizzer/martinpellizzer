<p>Dryopteris ensifera, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
