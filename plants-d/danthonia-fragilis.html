                    <h1>Danthonia fragilis</h1>
<p>Danthonia fragilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, delicate blades that are often slightly curled at the tips, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is adapted to saturated soil conditions, making it a common component of riparian and wetland ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Danthonia fragilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
