<p>Dolia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Dolia puberula is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
