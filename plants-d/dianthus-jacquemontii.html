<p>Dianthus jacquemontii, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Dianthus jacquemontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
