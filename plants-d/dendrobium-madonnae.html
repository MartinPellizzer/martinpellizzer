                    <h1>Dendrobium madonnae</h1>
<p>Dendrobium madonnae, commonly known as the Madonna orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium madonnae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
