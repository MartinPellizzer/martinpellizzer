                    <h1>Dryopteris rosenstockii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The fern's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate gardens.</p>
