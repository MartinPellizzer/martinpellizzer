                    <h1>Dryopteris tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
