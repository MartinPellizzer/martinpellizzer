                    <h1>Dendrophthoe carinata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe carinata, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy, yellowish-green berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the host trees and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
