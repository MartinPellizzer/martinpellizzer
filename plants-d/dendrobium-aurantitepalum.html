<p>Dendrobium aurantitepalum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that produce vibrant yellow flowers with red streaks. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, helping it survive in its often-dry habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium aurantitepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
