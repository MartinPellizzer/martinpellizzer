                    <h1>Daucus jolensis</h1>
<p>Daucus jolensis, commonly known as the Jolens carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant native to Central Asia, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and umbels of small white flowers. The plant produces a taproot that is typically smaller and less fleshy than that of cultivated carrots. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to plant breeders for potential use in improving carrot cultivars.</p>
