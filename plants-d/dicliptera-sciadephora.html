<p>Dicliptera sciadephora, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and erect, sometimes branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
