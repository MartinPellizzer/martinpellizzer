                    <h1>Delphinium dolichocentroides var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Delphinium dolichocentroides var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its smaller leaves compared to other delphinium species, hence its name "parvifolium," meaning "small leaf.".</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
