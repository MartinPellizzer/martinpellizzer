                    <h1>Dryopteris × initialis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × initialis, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies.</p>
