<p>Diplanthemum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are often covered in fine hairs. Diplanthemum species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
