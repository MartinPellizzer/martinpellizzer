<p>Devia xeromorpha, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself and access deep groundwater.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
