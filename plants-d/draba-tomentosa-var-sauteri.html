                    <h1>Draba tomentosa var. sauteri</h1>
<p>Draba tomentosa var. sauteri, commonly known as the Sauter's hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
