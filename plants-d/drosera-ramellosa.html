<p>Drosera ramellosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of glandular hairs that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and forms dense mats or cushions. Its leaves are elongated and covered in red-tipped tentacles that trap and digest insects.</p>
<p>Drosera ramellosa is a hardy species that can survive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
