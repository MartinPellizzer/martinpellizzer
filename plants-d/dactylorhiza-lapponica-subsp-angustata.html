<p>Dactylorhiza lapponica subsp.</p>
<p>angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in wet, peaty or boggy habitats, often in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces erect, slender stems that bear few leaves and spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
