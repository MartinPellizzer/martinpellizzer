                    <h1>Dryopteris nigrescentia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nigrescentia, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its bright green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a delicate, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in rich, organic soil and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
