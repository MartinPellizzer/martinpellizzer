                    <h1>Dryopteris labordei var. purpurascens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris labordei var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple frond wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a striking purplish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
