                    <h1>Dendrophthora talamancana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora talamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries, which are important for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, often leading to reduced growth or even death in severe cases.</p>
