<p>Dryopteris × fraser-jenkinsii, commonly known as the Fraser-Jenkins shield fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Dryopteris fraseri and Dryopteris jenkinsii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
