<p>Dryopteris lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
