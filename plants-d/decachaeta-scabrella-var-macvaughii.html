                    <h1>Decachaeta scabrella var. macvaughii</h1>
<p>Decachaeta scabrella var. macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's decachaeta, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapting to pollination by insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
