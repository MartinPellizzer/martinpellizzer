<p>Dactylis paispaloides, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
