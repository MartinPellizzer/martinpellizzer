<p>Drosera macrantha subsp.</p>
<p>eremaea, commonly known as the desert sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, often surviving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, arranged in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient, capable of regenerating from its root system after periods of desiccation.</p>
