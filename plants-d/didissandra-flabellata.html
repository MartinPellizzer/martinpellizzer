                    <h1>Didissandra flabellata</h1>
<p>Didissandra flabellata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage.</p>
<p>Didissandra flabellata is also valued for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal care.</p>
