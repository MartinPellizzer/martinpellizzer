                    <h1>Durabaculum albertisiana</h1>
<p>Durabaculum albertisiana, commonly known as the Albert's durabaculum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants adapted to humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
