                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. vestita</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. vestita, commonly known as the white mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its white, woolly appearance and is often found in high-altitude habitats.</p>
