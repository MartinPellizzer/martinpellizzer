                    <h1>Dendrobium connatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium connatum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive yellow tip on the petals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium connatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
