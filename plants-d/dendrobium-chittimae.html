<p>Dendrobium chittimae, commonly known as the Chittim's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids, many of which are prized for their ornamental value. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow with greenish-brown markings, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
