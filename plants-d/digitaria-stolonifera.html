<p>Digitaria stolonifera, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread aggressively across the ground. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Digitaria stolonifera is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and rapid growth.</p>
