<p>Discladium squarrosum, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates where it is exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically pale blue or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
