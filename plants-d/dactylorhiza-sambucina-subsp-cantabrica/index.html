                            <h1>Dactylorhiza Sambucina Subsp. Cantabrica</h1>
<p>Sambucina orchid, scientifically known as Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp. cantabrica, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain and southern France. This orchid thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded woodlands and rocky habitats. Its striking violet-blue flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of elegance to the natural landscape. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it survive in its challenging environment. Due to habitat loss and climate change, the Sambucina orchid faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
