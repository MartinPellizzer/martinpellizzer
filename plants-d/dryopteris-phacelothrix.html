<p>Dryopteris phacelothrix, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
