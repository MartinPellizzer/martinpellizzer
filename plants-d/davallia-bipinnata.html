                    <h1>Davallia bipinnata</h1>
<p>Davallia bipinnata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, moss-like growth covering its base. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
