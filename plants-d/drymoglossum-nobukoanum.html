<p>Drymoglossum nobukoanum, commonly known as the Japanese moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a complex thalloid structure with a central axis and leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>This moss is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
