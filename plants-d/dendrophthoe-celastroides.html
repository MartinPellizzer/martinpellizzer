                    <h1>Dendrophthoe celastroides</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe celastroides, commonly known as the Indian ghost fern, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients from its host. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, moss-like covering of leaves that gives it a ghostly appearance. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique morphology, it plays a specific ecological role in its habitat.</p>
