                    <h1>Dactylorchis incarnata var. latissima</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis incarnata var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
