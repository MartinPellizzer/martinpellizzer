<p>Dendrobium reticulatum, commonly known as the netted dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a branching stem system with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium reticulatum produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming in clusters.</p>
