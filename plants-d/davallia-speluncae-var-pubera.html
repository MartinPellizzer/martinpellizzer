                    <h1>Davallia speluncae var. pubera</h1>
<p>Davallia speluncae var. pubera, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, and hairy fronds, which help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or shaded forest floors, where it thrives in low light conditions. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its unique growth pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
