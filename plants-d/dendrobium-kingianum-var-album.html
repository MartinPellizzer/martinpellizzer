                    <h1>Dendrobium kingianum var. album</h1>
<p>Dendrobium kingianum var. album, commonly known as the White Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a slight blush of color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall.</p>
