                    <h1>Dendrophthoe pruinosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe pruinosa, commonly known as the satin leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to host trees. The plant produces small, white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in small inflorescences, while its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe pruinosa plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
