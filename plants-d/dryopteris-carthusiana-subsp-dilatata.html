<p>Dryopteris carthusiana subsp.</p>
<p>dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The subspecies dilatata is distinguished by its broader and more spreading fronds compared to the typical form of D. carthusiana.</p>
