                    <h1>Dimeria ornithopoda f. subrobusta</h1>
<p>Dimeria ornithopoda f. subrobusta, commonly known as the robust dimeria, is a variant of the dimeria plant characterized by its more sturdy and robust growth habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes various succulent plants adapted to arid environments. This particular form exhibits dense, fleshy stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and water loss. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in cacti to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
