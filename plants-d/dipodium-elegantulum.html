<p>Dipodium elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant dipodium, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
