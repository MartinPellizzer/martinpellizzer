<p>Digitaria chacoensis, commonly known as Chaco grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Digitaria chacoensis is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
