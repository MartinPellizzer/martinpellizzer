                    <h1>Dendrophthoe gamblei</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe gamblei, commonly known as the Indian ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host tree for nutrients. The plant has a slender, vine-like structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden among the foliage of its host. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the monsoon season.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
