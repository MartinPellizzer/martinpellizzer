                    <h1>Dryopteris bifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bifrons, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two distinct sections, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are generally dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
