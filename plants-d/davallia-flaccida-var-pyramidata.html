                    <h1>Davallia flaccida var. pyramidata</h1>
<p>Davallia flaccida var. pyramidata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a compact, clumping fern that forms dense, upright clumps of narrow, arching fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, bamboo-like appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering.</p>
<p>The varietal form, pyramidata, is characterized by its more compact growth habit compared to the standard Davallia flaccida.</p>
