                    <h1>Dendrophthoe leucobotrya</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe leucobotrya, commonly known as the white-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract resources.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe leucobotrya plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing the health and diversity of its host trees.</p>
