                    <h1>Dendromyza stellata</h1>
<p>Dendromyza stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant's unique morphology includes a star-like appearance due to its branching pattern and the arrangement of its floral clusters. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Dendromyza stellata is found in various regions of Australia, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
