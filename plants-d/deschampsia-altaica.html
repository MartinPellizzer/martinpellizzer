                    <h1>Deschampsia altaica</h1>
<p>Deschampsia altaica, commonly known as the high alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, hair-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Deschampsia altaica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
