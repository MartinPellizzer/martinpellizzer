<p>Dactylis glomerata f. rigidior, commonly known as rigid brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and tightly packed inflorescences.</p>
<p>It features narrow, rigid leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock in temperate regions.</p>
