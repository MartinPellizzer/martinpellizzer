                    <h1>Dendrosida breedlovei</h1>
<p>Dendrosida breedlovei, commonly known as the Breedlove's tree-dwelling fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on epiphytic growth on tree trunks and branches. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrosida breedlovei is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
