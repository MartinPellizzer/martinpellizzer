                    <h1>Dracula exasperata</h1>
<p>Dracula exasperata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, showy flower that blooms once a year.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
