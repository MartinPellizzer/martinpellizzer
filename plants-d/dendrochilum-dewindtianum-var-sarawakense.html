                    <h1>Dendrochilum dewindtianum var. sarawakense</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum dewindtianum var. sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
