                    <h1>Dryopteris caduca</h1>
<p>Dryopteris caduca, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are sensitive to desiccation, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The sensitive fern is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
