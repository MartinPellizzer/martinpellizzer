                    <h1>Dicranotaenia dahomeensis</h1>
<p>Dicranotaenia dahomeensis, commonly known as the Dahomey fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short, erect spikes, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dicranotaenia dahomeensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
