                    <h1>Davallia philippinensis</h1>
<p>Davallia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble a floating aquatic plant, though it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, ovate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
