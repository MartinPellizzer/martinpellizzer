<p>Dryopteris nimbata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, short-stemmed fronds.</p>
<p>The cloud fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
