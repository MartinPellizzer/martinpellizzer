                    <h1>Delosperma lavisiae var. parvisepalum</h1>
<p>Delosperma lavisiae var. parvisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its small, rounded sepals give it the specific epithet *parvisepalum*, meaning "small sepals.".</p>
