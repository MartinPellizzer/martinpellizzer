<p>Dryopteris goldieana subsp.</p>
<p>celsa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a shade-tolerant evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, often with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, upright rosette of fertile and sterile fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in moist, shaded garden settings.</p>
