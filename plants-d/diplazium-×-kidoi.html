                    <h1>Diplazium × kidoi</h1>
<p>Diplazium × kidoi, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sellowianum.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
