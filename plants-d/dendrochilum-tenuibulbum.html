                    <h1>Dendrochilum tenuibulbum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum tenuibulbum, commonly known as the slender-bulb orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees or other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Dendrochilum tenuibulbum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
