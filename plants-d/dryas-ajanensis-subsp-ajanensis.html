<p>Dryas ajanensis subsp.</p>
<p>ajanensis, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, often found at high altitudes where temperatures are cold and conditions are harsh.</p>
