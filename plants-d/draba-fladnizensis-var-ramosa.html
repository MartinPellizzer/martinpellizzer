                    <h1>Draba fladnizensis var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Draba fladnizensis var. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in mountain ecosystems.</p>
