<p>Dictyogramme manniana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which increase surface area for photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
