<p>Discocalyx phanerophlebia, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped thallus that is often covered in a dense layer of bright yellow to orange-brown pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are elongated and bear the male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
