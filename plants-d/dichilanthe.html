<p>Dichilanthe, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dichilanthe species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in their native habitats.</p>
