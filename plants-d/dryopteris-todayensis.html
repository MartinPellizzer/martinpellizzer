<p>Dryopteris todayensis, commonly known as the today's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
