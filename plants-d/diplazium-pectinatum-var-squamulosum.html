                    <h1>Diplazium pectinatum var. squamulosum</h1>
<p>Diplazium pectinatum var. squamulosum, commonly known as the scaly sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its stout, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered with a layer of scaly, brownish structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
