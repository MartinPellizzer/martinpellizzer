                    <h1>Dryopteris lanceolata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
