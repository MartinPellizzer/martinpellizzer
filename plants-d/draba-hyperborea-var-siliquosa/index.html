                            <h1>Draba Hyperborea Var. Siliquosa</h1>
<p>Alpine draba, scientifically known as Draba hyperborea var. siliquosa, is a hardy flowering plant that thrives in the harsh conditions of high mountain environments. It is commonly found in the alpine zones of Europe and Asia, where it adapts to cold temperatures and thin soils. This small plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with delicate leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for pollinators and contributing to soil stability. Its resilience and beauty make it a symbol of the rugged beauty of mountain landscapes.</p>
