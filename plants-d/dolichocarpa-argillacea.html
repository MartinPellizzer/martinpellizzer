                    <h1>Dolichocarpa argillacea</h1>
<p>Dolichocarpa argillacea, commonly known as the clayroot plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, with slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across muddy substrates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Dolichocarpa argillacea plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
