<p>Doodia scaberula, commonly known as the rough maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in a dense layer of minute, rough-scaled structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Doodia scaberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
