<p>Dactylorhiza elata, scientifically known as Dactylorhiza praetermissa var. elata, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and relatively small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and marshes, often growing in association with specific fungal partners. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dactylorhiza elata is considered a vulnerable species, making it a focus of conservation efforts. Its unique ecological role and delicate beauty highlight the importance of preserving its natural habitat.</p>
