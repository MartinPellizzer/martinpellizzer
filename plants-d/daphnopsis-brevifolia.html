                    <h1>Daphnopsis brevifolia</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved daphnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
