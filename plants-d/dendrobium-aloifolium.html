                    <h1>Dendrobium aloifolium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium aloifolium, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium aloifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
