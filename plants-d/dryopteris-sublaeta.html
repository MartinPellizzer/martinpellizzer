                    <h1>Dryopteris sublaeta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sublaeta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can access the consistent humidity it requires. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
