<p>Drosera moorei, commonly known as the Moore's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape.</p>
<p>Drosera moorei is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its nutrients through insect prey.</p>
