                    <h1>Duvernoia orbicularis</h1>
<p>Duvernoia orbicularis, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of gymnosperms, and it has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and historical significance make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
