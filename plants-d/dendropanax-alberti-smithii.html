<p>Dendropanax alberti-smithii, commonly known as Albert's arrowleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
