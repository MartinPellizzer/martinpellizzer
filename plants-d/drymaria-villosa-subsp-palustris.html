<p>Drymaria villosa subsp.</p>
<p>palustris, commonly known as swampy hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist habitats. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
