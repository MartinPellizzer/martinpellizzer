<p>Dendrobium eksanianum, commonly known as the Eksanian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, slender stems that can reach several feet in length, often bearing clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
