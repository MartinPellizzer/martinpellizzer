<p>Dioon edule f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Mexican fern, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a short trunk and a crown of pinnately divided, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones that are typically greenish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
