<p>Dicksonia antillensis, commonly known as the West Indian tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, brownish layer, which is composed of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Dicksonia antillensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests.</p>
