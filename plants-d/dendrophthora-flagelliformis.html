                    <h1>Dendrophthora flagelliformis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora flagelliformis, commonly known as the threadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthora flagelliformis plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing sustenance for various animals.</p>
