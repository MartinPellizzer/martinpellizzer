                <h1>Dinochloa elevatissima</h1>
<p>Dinochloa elevatissima, commonly known as the giant alpine moss, is a unique and rare plant species found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant has dark green, velvety leaves that are tightly packed, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Dinochloa elevatissima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
