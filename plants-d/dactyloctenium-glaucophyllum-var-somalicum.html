                    <h1>Dactyloctenium glaucophyllum var. somalicum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium glaucophyllum var. somalicum, commonly known as Somali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used for forage in livestock grazing systems due to its hardiness and nutritional value.</p>
