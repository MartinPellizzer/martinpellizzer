                    <h1>Desmodium flexuosum</h1>
<p>Desmodium flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Desmodium flexuosum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
