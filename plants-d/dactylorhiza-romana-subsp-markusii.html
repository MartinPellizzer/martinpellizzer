<p>Dactylorhiza romana subsp.</p>
<p>markusii, commonly known as the Roman marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, preferring moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a single upright stem with several elliptical leaves and produces tall, slender inflorescences bearing numerous small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a characteristic common among orchids.</p>
<p>The subspecies markusii is distinguished by its slightly different flower morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species.</p>
