<p>Deparia petersenii subsp.</p>
<p>congrua, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second.</p>
