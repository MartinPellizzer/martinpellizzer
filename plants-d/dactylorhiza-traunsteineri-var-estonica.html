                    <h1>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. estonica</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. estonica, commonly known as the Estonian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It has a complex root system with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
