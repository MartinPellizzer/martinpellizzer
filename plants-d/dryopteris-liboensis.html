<p>Dryopteris liboensis, commonly known as the Libo wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
