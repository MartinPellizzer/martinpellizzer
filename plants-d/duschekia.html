                    <h1>Duschekia</h1>
<p>Duschekia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Duschekia species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. They typically have succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, and their stems are often hairy to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Duschekia grandiflora, which is prized for its ornamental value in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
