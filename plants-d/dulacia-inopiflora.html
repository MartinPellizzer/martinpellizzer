<p>Dulacia inopiflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that appear almost translucent, giving it its common name. The plant has a delicate, climbing habit and produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Dulacia inopiflora is considered a rare and under-studied species in botanical research.</p>
