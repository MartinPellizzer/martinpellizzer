<p>Dryopteris pseudosabaei, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its unique growth pattern.</p>
