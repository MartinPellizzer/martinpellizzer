                    <h1>Drosera intermedia var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Drosera intermedia var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its leaves are elongated and covered in red-hued secretory glands that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Drosera species but is distinguished by its more delicate and less robust growth form.</p>
