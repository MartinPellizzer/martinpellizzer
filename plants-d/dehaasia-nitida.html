<p>Dehaasia nitida, commonly known as the slender sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse appearance. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
