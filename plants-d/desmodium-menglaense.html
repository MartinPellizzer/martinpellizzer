                    <h1>Desmodium menglaense</h1>
<p>Desmodium menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla sensitive pea, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait that may aid in defense against herbivores. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
