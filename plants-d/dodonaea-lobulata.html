<p>Dodonaea lobulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically silver or gray in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands.</p>
<p>Dodonaea lobulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
