<p>Derwentia derwentiana subsp.</p>
<p>maideniana, commonly known as the Maude's derwentia, is a rare and distinctive fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understoreys. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
