<p>Dryopteris galanderi, commonly known as the Galander's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high humidity and acidic soil.</p>
