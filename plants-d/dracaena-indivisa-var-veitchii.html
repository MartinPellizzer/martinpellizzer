                    <h1>Dracaena indivisa var. veitchii</h1>
<p>Dracaena indivisa var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in indoor gardening due to its hardiness and ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions.</p>
