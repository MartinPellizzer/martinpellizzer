                            <h1>Diasperus Pedunculatus</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Diasperus pedunculatus, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is prized for its vibrant, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The tree's unique appearance, with its feathery leaves and colorful bracts, makes it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that the plant can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
