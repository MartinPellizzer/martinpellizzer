<p>Dryopteris auriculifera, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of China.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shape that resembles a shield, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
