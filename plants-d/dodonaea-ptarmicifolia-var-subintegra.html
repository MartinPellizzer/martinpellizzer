<p>Dodonaea ptarmicifolia var. subintegra, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>

The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments.</p>
