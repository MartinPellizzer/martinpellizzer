<p>Decaisnina brittenii subsp.</p>
<p>speciosa, commonly known as the golden bell heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
