                    <h1>Diceratella psilotrichoides</h1>
<p>Diceratella psilotrichoides, commonly known as the creeping spike moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in rocky or forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and cryptic species.</p>
