                    <h1>Drosera brevifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Drosera brevifolia var. major, commonly known as the large-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers in summer, and it thrives in moist, acidic environments. Its leaves are typically broader and longer than those of the typical *D. brevifolia* and are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
