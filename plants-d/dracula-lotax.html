                    <h1>Dracula lotax</h1>
<p>Dracula lotax, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark red and purple flowers that resemble the appearance of a vampire's face, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often growing along tree trunks in a phenomenon known as epiphytism. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dracula lotax is considered a conservation concern.</p>
