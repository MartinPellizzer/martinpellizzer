                    <h1>Deparia boryana</h1>
<p>Deparia boryana, commonly known as the Bory's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is short and thick, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction.</p>
