                    <h1>Dispeltophorus</h1>
<p>Dispeltophorus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its unique ecological requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Dispeltophorus is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
