                    <h1>Deparia × nakaikeana</h1>
<p>Deparia × nakaikeana, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Deparia and Nakaikeania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is usually a vibrant green, with intricate leaf patterns that contribute to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
