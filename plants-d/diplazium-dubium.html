<p>Diplazium dubium, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Diplazium dubium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in the undergrowth of forests where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory.</p>
