<p>Dimorphostemon pectinatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is not native.</p>
