<p>Draba argentifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, basal rosettes of silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Draba argentifolia is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants.</p>
