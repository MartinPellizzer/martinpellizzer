                    <h1>Dryopteris quadripinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, with each pinna further divided into smaller segments called pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
