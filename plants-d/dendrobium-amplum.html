<p>Dendrobium amplum, commonly known as the large-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant features long, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming in summer.</p>
