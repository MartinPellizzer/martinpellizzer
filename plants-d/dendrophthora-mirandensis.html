<p>Dendrophthora mirandensis, commonly known as the Mirandese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on specific host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are usually small, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dendrophthora mirandensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
