<p>Drymoglossum carnosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically broad and overlapping, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This moss is often found in forest floors and rocky areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and resilience make it an important component of many temperate ecosystems.</p>
