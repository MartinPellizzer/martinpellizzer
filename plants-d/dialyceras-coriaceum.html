<p>Dialyceras coriaceum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic animals. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it uses its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments, making it an important indicator of aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
