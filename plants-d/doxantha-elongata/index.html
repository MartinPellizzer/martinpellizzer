                            <h1>Doxantha Elongata</h1>
<p>Doxantha grass, scientifically known as Doxantha elongata, is a unique and resilient plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This grass is often found in sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in dry landscapes. Its ecological significance makes it a valuable subject for further study in plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
