                    <h1>Dendrobium kontumense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium kontumense, commonly known as the Kontum orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in its often-dry, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Dendrobium kontumense is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
