                    <h1>Daucus littoralis var. longiradiatus</h1>
<p>Daucus littoralis var. longiradiatus, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, exhibiting a robust root system adapted to saline and wind-swept environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated, radiating rays in the flower heads, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
