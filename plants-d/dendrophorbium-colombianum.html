                    <h1>Dendrophorbium colombianum</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian tree lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, tropical environments, particularly in the mountainous regions of Colombia. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the intertwined partners. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance by contributing to nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
