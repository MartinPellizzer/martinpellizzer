                    <h1>Delphinium paniculatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium paniculatum, commonly known as the clustered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it is toxic to livestock and humans.</p>
