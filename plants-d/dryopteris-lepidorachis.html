                    <h1>Dryopteris lepidorachis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lepidorachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in damp, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, shield-like covering.</p>
