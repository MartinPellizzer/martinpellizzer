<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often appearing in shades of pink or red.</p>
<p>Drosera leioblastus is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
