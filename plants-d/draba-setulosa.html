<p>Draba setulosa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>
