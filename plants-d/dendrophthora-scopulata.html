                    <h1>Dendrophthora scopulata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora scopulata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, where it forms dense, crust-like growths on stone surfaces. The plant's structure is non-photosynthetic, relying entirely on its algal or cyanobacterial component for energy. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
