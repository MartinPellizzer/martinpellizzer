<p>Diasperus arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Diasperus arenicola is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a hardy and resilient species suited to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
