                    <h1>Dendrophthoe incarnata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe incarnata, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of seeds via birds, which consume the berries and deposit the seeds on new host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in woodland and forest environments.</p>
