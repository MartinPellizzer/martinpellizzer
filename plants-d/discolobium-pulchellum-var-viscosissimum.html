                    <h1>Discolobium pulchellum var. viscosissimum</h1>
<p>Discolobium pulchellum var. viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky discolobium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its sticky foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>The varietal form viscosissimum is distinguished by its particularly viscous resinous secretions.</p>
