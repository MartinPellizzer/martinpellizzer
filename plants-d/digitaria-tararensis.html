<p>Digitaria tararensis, commonly known as the Tararensis grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshy areas and riparian zones. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Digitaria tararensis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for use in wetland restoration projects.</p>
