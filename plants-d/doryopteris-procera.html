<p>Doryopteris procera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a striking fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant features a distinctive, shield-shaped rachis, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
