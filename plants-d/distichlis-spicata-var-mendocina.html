                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. mendocina</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dune environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
