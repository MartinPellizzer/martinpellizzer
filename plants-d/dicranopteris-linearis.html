                    <h1>Dicranopteris linearis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris linearis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, linear pinnae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
