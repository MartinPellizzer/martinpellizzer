                    <h1>Diplostephium glutinosum f. subspathulatum</h1>
<p>Diplostephium glutinosum f. subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stickyweed, is a variant of the stickyweed species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in low, shrub-like formations, with small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are often glandular and may have a waxy coating, adaptations that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
