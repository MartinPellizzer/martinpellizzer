                    <h1>Dicranopteris oligocarpa</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris oligocarpa, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
