<p>Dryopteris aculeata var. muricata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
