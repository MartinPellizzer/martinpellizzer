<p>Dendrobium setifolium, commonly known as the feather-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium setifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
