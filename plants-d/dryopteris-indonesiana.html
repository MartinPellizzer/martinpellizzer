<p>Dryopteris indonesiana, commonly known as the Indonesian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal uses.</p>
