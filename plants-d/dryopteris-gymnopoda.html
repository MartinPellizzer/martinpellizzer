                    <h1>Dryopteris gymnopoda</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched, spore-bearing stalks that emerge from a rhizome system. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching shape that gives the plant a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
