                    <h1>Dictyophleba stipulosa</h1>
<p>Dictyophleba stipulosa, commonly known as the stipulate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leafy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are important for bird dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique component of forest ecosystems.</p>
