                    <h1>Drynaria rigidula var. whitei</h1>
<p>Drynaria rigidula var. whitei, commonly known as the white-veined tree fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the fronds above.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique botanical feature.</p>
