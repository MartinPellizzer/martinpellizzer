<p>Dethawia tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian slender fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely arranged pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
