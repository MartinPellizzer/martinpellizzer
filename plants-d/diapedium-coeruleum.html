<p>Diapedium coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue flowers that resemble those of the true grasses, though it is not a grass but a monocot. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>Diapedium coeruleum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
