                    <h1>Digitalis dubia var. marcosii</h1>
<p>Digitalis dubia var. marcosii, commonly known as the Marcosii foxglove, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of downy hair. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, like other members of the Digitalis genus, it contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
