<p>Dendrobium purissimum, commonly known as the white dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium purissimum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
