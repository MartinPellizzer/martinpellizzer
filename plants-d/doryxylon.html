                    <h1>Doryxylon</h1>
<p>Doryxylon, commonly known as the "barkless tree," is a unique plant found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of traditional bark, instead featuring a smooth, greenish stem that resembles a shrub. The plant has a short lifespan, typically living only a few years before it dies and is replaced by new growth. Its botanical structure includes simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that produce non-showy fruits.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, Doryxylon plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its ecological significance.</p>
