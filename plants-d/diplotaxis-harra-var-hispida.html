                    <h1>Diplotaxis harra var. hispida</h1>
<p>Diplotaxis harra var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous species. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, aiding in its survival in unstable climates.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves provides additional protection against desiccation and herbivory.</p>
