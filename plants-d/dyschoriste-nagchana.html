<p>Dyschoriste nagchana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are often rooted in the substrate, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Dyschoriste nagchana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
