                    <h1>Diplazium decipiens</h1>
<p>Diplazium decipiens, commonly known as the false button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble those of a true button fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination process.</p>
