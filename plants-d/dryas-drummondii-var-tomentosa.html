<p>Dryas drummondii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate the plant against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and tundra.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
