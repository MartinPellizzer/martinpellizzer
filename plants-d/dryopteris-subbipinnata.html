                    <h1>Dryopteris subbipinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subbipinnata, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
