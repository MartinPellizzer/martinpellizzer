                    <h1>Dryopteris macarthyi</h1>
<p>Dryopteris macarthyi, commonly known as the Macarthur's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild.</p>
