<p>Didymomeles, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and features distinctive, thickened, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, aiding in survival in arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, while the flowers are small and clustered, often in white or pink hues. Didymomeles species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They are also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians.</p>
