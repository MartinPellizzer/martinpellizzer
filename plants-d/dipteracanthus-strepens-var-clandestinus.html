                    <h1>Dipteracanthus strepens var. clandestinus</h1>
<p>Dipteracanthus strepens var. clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden bellflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often resembling those of its more common relative, Dipteracanthus strepens. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within dense forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
