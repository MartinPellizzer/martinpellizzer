                    <h1>Daboecia cantabrica f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Daboecia cantabrica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a rare and striking variant of the common heath.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This plant is native to the coastal regions of northern Spain, particularly the Basque Country. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
