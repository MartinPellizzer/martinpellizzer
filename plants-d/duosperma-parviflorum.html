                    <h1>Duosperma parviflorum</h1>
<p>Duosperma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered duosperma, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Duosperma parviflorum is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal care once established.</p>
