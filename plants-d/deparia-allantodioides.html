<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in muddy or sandy substrates. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the production of floating, spore-bearing fruits.</p>
