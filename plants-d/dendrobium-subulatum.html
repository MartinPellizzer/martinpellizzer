                    <h1>Dendrobium subulatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium subulatum, commonly known as the needle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, needle-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Dendrobium subulatum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
