                    <h1>Diphelypaea helenae</h1>
<p>Diphelypaea helenae, commonly known as Helen's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, overlapping lobes, resembling the structure of true water clovers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in shallow, nutrient-rich environments. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche.</p>
