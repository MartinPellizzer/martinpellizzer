                    <h1>Dendrocoryne speciosum</h1>
<p>Dendrocoryne speciosum, commonly known as the golden torch tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are primarily pollinated by insects, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
