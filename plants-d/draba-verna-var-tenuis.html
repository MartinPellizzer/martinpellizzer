<p>Draba verna var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and stipulate leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba verna var. tenuis produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and soil stabilization.</p>
