<p>Dryopteris intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
