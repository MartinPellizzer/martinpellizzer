                    <h1>Drosera montana var. schwackei</h1>
<p>Drosera montana var. schwackei, commonly known as the Alpine Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a terminal inflorescence of small, white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
