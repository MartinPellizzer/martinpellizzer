<p>Diospyros touranensis, commonly known as the Touran persimmon, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other well-known species like the common ebony and persimmon. The tree produces small, oval fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they can be harvested earlier if desired. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The wood of Diospyros touranensis is dense and hard, making it valuable for carpentry and tool-making.</p>
