The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
