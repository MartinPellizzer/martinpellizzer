                    <h1>Dennstaedtia fusca</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia fusca, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
