                    <h1>Dactilon</h1>
<p>Dactilon, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of the true dandelion. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Dactilon has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered a weed but can be used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
