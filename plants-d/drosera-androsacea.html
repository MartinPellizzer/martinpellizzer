                    <h1>Drosera androsacea</h1>
<p>Drosera androsacea, commonly known as the Androsace sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or marshy environments, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling in its native environment.</p>
