                    <h1>Dendrobium racieanum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium racieanum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium racieanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
