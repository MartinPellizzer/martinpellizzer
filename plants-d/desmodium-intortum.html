                    <h1>Desmodium intortum</h1>
<p>Desmodium intortum, commonly known as curly top sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, coiled stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by cylindrical, woody pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with native vegetation and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
