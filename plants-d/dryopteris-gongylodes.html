                    <h1>Dryopteris gongylodes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gongylodes, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, compact crown of dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance that gives the plant its ornamental value. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
