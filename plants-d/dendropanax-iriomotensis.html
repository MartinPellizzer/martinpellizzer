                    <h1>Dendropanax iriomotensis</h1>
<p>Dendropanax iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote tree fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Iriomote in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the subtropical rainforests of the island. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
