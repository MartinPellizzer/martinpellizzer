<p>Deschampsia cespitosa var. borealis, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that often turns reddish in autumn. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowering stems produce delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native habitat.</p>
