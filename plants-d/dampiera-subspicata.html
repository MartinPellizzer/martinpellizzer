                    <h1>Dampiera subspicata</h1>
<p>Dampiera subspicata, commonly known as the coastal dampiera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Dampiera subspicata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal habitats.</p>
