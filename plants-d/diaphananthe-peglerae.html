<p>Diaphananthe peglerae, commonly known as the Pegler's diaphananthe, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring palmately compound leaves with a striking, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Diaphananthe peglerae is noted for its limited distribution and is often found in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
