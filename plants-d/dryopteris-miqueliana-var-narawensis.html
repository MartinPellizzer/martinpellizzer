                    <h1>Dryopteris miqueliana var. narawensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris miqueliana var. narawensis, commonly known as the Narawen fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
