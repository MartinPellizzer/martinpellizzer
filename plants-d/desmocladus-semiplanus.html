<p>Desmocladus semiplanus, commonly known as the flatleaf desmocladus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
