The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Drosera stenopetala is a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
