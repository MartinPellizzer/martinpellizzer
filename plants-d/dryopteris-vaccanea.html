                    <h1>Dryopteris vaccanea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vaccanea, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or on mountain slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Dryopteris vaccanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
