                    <h1>Dutaillyea poissonii</h1>
<p>Dutaillyea poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's Dutaillyea, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, much about its ecological role and reproductive habits remains undocumented.</p>
