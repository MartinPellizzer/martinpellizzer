                    <h1>Dryopteris sciaphila</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sciaphila, commonly known as the shade fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months.</p>
