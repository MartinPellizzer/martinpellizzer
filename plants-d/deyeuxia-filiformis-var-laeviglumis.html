                    <h1>Deyeuxia filiformis var. laeviglumis</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia filiformis var. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smooth glume sedge, is a grass species characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are smooth and have a distinctive, elongated shape that helps distinguish it from other similar sedges.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
