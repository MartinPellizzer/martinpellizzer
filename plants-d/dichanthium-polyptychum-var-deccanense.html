<p>Dichanthium polyptychum var. deccanense, commonly known as the Deccan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
