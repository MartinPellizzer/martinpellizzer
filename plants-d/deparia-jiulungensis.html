                    <h1>Deparia jiulungensis</h1>
<p>Deparia jiulungensis, commonly known as the Jiulung fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deparia jiulungensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
