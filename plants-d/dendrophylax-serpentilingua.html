                    <h1>Dendrophylax serpentilingua</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax serpentilingua, commonly known as the serpent tongue orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble the shape of a serpent's tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree branches, anchoring itself with its roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
