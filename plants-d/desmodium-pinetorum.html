                    <h1>Desmodium pinetorum</h1>
<p>Desmodium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest clover, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
