<p>Drosera indumenta, commonly known as the hairy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are small and hairy, with the glands arranged in a dense, fuzzy layer.</p>
<p>Drosera indumenta is known for its ability to digest captured prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
