                    <h1>Dianella revoluta var. brevicaulis</h1>
<p>Dianella revoluta var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form a dense, rounded clump. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance.</p>
<p>The varietal form brevicaulis distinguishes it by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical variety.</p>
