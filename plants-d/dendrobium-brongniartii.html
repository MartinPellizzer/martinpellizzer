                    <h1>Dendrobium brongniartii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium brongniartii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a strong fragrance. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with irregular rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium brongniartii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
