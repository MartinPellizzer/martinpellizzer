<p>Dryopteris aculeatum subsp.</p>
<p>lobata, commonly known as the lobate wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
