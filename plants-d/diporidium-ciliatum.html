                    <h1>Diporidium ciliatum</h1>
<p>Diporidium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Diporidium ciliatum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods.</p>
