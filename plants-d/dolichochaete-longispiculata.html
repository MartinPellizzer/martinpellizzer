<p>Dolichochaete longispiculata, commonly known as the long-spined flatworm, is a species of planarian belonging to the family Tricladida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and the presence of long, spicule-like structures along its dorsal surface. This species is typically found in moist environments, such as under stones or in leaf litter, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its body is covered in cilia, which aid in movement and feeding.</p>
<p>Dolichochaete longispiculata plays a role in decomposition by consuming small organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
