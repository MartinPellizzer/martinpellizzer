                    <h1>Dendrophthoe repanda</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe repanda, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large sections of its host's branches. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its sticky seeds are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
