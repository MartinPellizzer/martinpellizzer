<p>Dortmanna urens, commonly known as the common stinkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its crushed leaves.</p>
