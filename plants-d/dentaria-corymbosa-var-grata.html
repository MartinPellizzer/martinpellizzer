<p>Dentaria corymbosa var. grata, commonly known as the showy toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, fleshy, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, enabling it to survive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
