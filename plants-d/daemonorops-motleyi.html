                    <h1>Daemonorops motleyi</h1>
<p>Daemonorops motleyi, commonly known as the Motley's palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate individuals, a feature common in cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Daemonorops motleyi is listed as endangered by the IUCN.</p>
