<p>Dendrobium limpidum subsp.</p>
<p>daunceyae, commonly known as the Dauncey's Dendrobium, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants rather than in soil. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
