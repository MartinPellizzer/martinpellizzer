<p>Dryopteris hirtula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
