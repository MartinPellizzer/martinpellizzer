<p>Didiplis diandra f. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic didiplis, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
