                    <h1>Dendrophthoe falcata var. amplexifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe falcata var. amplexifolia, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant's stems are fleshy and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
