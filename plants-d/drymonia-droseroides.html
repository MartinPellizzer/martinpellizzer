                    <h1>Drymonia droseroides</h1>
<p>Drymonia droseroides, commonly known as the sticky false sandwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish or purple in color, and they form dense, cushion-like rosettes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study.</p>
