<p>Dendrobium lapeyrouseoides, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lapeyrouseoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
