<p>Dryopteris porosa, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaves.</p>
