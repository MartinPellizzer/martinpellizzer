<p>Dendrobium crassulifolium, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the summer months. It grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections.</p>
