<p>Dichanthelium dichotomum var. ramulosum, commonly known as the ramulose dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
