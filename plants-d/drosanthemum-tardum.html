                    <h1>Drosanthemum tardum</h1>
<p>Drosanthemum tardum, commonly known as the slow-growing drosanthemum, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer, and is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
