                    <h1>Dryopteris × yamashitae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × yamashitae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris erythrosora and Dryopteris japonica.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern Asia.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
