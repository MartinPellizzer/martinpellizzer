                    <h1>Dryopteris parallela</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parallela, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
