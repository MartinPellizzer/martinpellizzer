                    <h1>Ditaxis haemiolandra</h1>
<p>Ditaxis haemiolandra, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
