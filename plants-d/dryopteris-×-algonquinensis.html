                    <h1>Dryopteris × algonquinensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × algonquinensis, commonly known as the Algonquin shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris marginalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, slightly curled margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, protective layer called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern North America.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
