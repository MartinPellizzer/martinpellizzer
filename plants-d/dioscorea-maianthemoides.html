                    <h1>Dioscorea maianthemoides</h1>
<p>Dioscorea maianthemoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
