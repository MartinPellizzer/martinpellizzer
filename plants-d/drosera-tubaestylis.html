<p>Drosera tubaestylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tubular stalks and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette and are covered in hair-like structures that aid in insect capture.</p>
<p>Drosera tubaestylis is a low-growing species that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
