<p>Dasyglossum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-tongued lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, leaf-like thallus with a distinct, reddish-brown upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The lichen typically grows on calcareous rock surfaces in temperate regions, forming dense, cushion-like patches. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its coloration and ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Dasyglossum ferrugineum is often used as an indicator species for monitoring air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
