                    <h1>Doodia crinita</h1>
<p>Doodia crinita, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems.</p>
