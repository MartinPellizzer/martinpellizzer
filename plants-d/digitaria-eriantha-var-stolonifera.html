<p>Digitaria eriantha var. stolonifera, commonly known as flat grass or stoloniferous digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
