                    <h1>Dryopteris subincisa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subincisa, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, though they may die back in winter in colder climates.</p>
