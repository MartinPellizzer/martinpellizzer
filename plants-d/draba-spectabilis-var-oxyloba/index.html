                            <h1>Draba Spectabilis Var. Oxyloba</h1>
<p>Showy draba, scientifically known as Draba spectabilis var. oxyloba, is a striking member of the Brassicaceae family native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This low-growing perennial is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often among rocky outcrops and alpine meadows. With its delicate, fern-like leaves and compact stature, it thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments where few plants can survive. Despite its beauty, Showy draba is often overlooked due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance. Conservation efforts are increasingly important as habitat loss and climate change threaten its survival in fragile ecosystems.</p>
