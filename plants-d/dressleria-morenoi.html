                    <h1>Dressleria morenoi</h1>
<p>Dressleria morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its harsh, mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in the dry, cool climate.</p>
<p>Dressleria morenoi is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution.</p>
