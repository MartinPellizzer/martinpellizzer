                    <h1>Dryopteris decrescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris decrescens, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates.</p>
