                    <h1>Davallia schimperi</h1>
<p>Davallia schimperi, commonly known as the silver-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery vein pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
