<p>Dryopteris laurisilvicola, commonly known as the laurel fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense, brownish coating. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, paper-like indusium.</p>
