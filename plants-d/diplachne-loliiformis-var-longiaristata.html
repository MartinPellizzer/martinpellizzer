                    <h1>Diplachne loliiformis var. longiaristata</h1>
<p>Diplachne loliiformis var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, and forms dense, rhizomatous clumps. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The variety longiaristata is distinguished by its elongated awns, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
