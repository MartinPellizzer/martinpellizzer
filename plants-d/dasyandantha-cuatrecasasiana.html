<p>Dasyandantha cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
