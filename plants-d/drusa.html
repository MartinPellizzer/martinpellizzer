                    <h1>Drusa</h1>
<p>Drusa, commonly known as a type of crystal cluster, is a botanical structure formed by the precipitation of minerals within a plant's tissues.</p>
<p>These formations are typically composed of calcite or other minerals and are often found in the stems or leaves of certain plants. Drusa is not a true plant but a mineral growth that occurs in some plant species, particularly in arid environments. The appearance of drusa can resemble a cluster of small, pointed crystals, giving the plant a unique and sometimes ornamental look.</p>
<p>This feature is often used in horticulture for decorative purposes.</p>
