                    <h1>Dryopteris paucijugum</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paucijugum, commonly known as the few-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
