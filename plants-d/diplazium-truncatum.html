                    <h1>Diplazium truncatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting the growth of its floating leaves.</p>
<p>Diplazium truncatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
