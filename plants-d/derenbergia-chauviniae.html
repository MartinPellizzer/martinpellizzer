                    <h1>Derenbergia chauviniae</h1>
<p>Derenbergia chauviniae, commonly known as the Chauvin's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, мясистые leaves. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are often pale pink or white, and it blooms sparingly, making it a rare sight in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Derenbergia chauviniae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
