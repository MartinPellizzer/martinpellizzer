                    <h1>Dracula psittacina</h1>
<p>Dracula psittacina, commonly known as the "Cockatoo's Bill," is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble a bird's beak, with vivid red and yellow hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
