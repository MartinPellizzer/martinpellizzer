<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Diapensia purpurea thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
