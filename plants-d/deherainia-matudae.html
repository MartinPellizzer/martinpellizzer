                    <h1>Deherainia matudae</h1>
<p>Deherainia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deherainia matudae is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
