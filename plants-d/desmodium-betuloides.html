                    <h1>Desmodium betuloides</h1>
<p>Desmodium betuloides, commonly known as the false buckthorn, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Desmodium betuloides has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often found in woodland and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
