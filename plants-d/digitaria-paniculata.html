                    <h1>Digitaria paniculata</h1>
<p>Digitaria paniculata, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Digitaria paniculata is adapted to warm climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
