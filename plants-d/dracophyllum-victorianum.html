                    <h1>Dracophyllum victorianum</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum victorianum, commonly known as the Victorian draco or Victorian heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its moist, acidic soil habitat.</p>
<p>Dracophyllum victorianum is well adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native environment and is often found in open, wind-exposed areas.</p>
