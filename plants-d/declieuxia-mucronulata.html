<p>Declieuxia mucronulata, commonly known as the Cape golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Declieuxia mucronulata is well-suited for xeriscaping and is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
