                    <h1>Drosera prostrata</h1>
<p>Drosera prostrata, commonly known as the dewy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing species that forms dense mats of sticky, glandular hair, which secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically prostrate, spreading across the ground to maximize exposure to potential prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Drosera prostrata is known for its ability to digest captured insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
