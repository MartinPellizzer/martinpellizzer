                <h1>Davallia repens</h1>
<p>Davallia repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its creeping growth habit and delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense mats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is not commonly observed in Davallia repens.</p>
