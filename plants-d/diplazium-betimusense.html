<p>Diplazium betimusense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Diplazium betimusense plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
