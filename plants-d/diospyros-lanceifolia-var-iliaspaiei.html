<p>Diospyros lanceifolia var. iliaspaiei, commonly known as the Desert Persimmon, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they may be astringent until mature. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
