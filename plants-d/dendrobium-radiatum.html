<p>Dendrobium radiatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive golden spike-like structure in the center.</p>
<p>Dendrobium radiatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
