                    <h1>Dactylis polygama f. spuria</h1>
<p>Dactylis polygama f. spuria, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces long, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a forage crop and in soil conservation due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
