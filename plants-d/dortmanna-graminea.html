<p>Dortmanna graminea, commonly known as the grass-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Dortmanna graminea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
