<p>Dendrobium speculum, commonly known as the mirror orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with short, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive mirror-like sheen on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium speculum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
