<p>Dorstenia homblei, commonly known as the "Bottle Tree," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing after rainfall. Its leaves are typically spirally arranged and can be either simple or compound, depending on the growth conditions.</p>
<p>Dorstenia homblei is also known for its ability to form a caudex, which contributes to its distinctive appearance and resilience.</p>
