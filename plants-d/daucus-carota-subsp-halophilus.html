<p>Daucus carota subsp.</p>
<p>halophilus, commonly known as the salt marsh carrot, is a subspecies of the carrot plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has a more compact growth form compared to the common carrot. Its leaves are typically shorter and more robust, and the roots are less developed than those of the cultivated carrot.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal soils and its potential for agricultural use in saline regions.</p>
