                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. thalassica</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. thalassica, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal regions.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and environmental benefits.</p>
