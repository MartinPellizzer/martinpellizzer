The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations.</p>
