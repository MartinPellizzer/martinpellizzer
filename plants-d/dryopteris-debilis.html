                    <h1>Dryopteris debilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris debilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a compact, upright frond with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like structure. Its sporangia are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
