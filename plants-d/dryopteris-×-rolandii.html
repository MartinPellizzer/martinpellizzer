                    <h1>Dryopteris × rolandii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × rolandii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris carpathica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lush, bright green fronds that often display a golden or yellowish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive success in suitable habitats.</p>
