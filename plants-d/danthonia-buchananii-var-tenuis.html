                    <h1>Danthonia buchananii var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Danthonia buchananii var. tenuis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like turf with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively in its native habitat.</p>
