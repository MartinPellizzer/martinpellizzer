<p>Dicerma biarticulatum subsp.</p>
<p>australiense, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
