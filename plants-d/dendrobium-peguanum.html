                    <h1>Dendrobium peguanum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium peguanum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought.</p>
<p>Dendrobium peguanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions.</p>
