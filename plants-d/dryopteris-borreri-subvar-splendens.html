                    <h1>Dryopteris borreri subvar. splendens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris borreri subvar. splendens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green on the upper surface and a striking golden-yellow underside, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is a popular choice for woodland gardens and shady landscapes.</p>
