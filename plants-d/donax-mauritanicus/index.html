                            <h1>Donax Mauritanicus</h1>
<p>Donax mauritanicus is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found along coastal dunes and in dry, saline environments. This plant is known for its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its small, needle-like leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Donax mauritanicus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
