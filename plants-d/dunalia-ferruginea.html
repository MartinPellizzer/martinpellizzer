                    <h1>Dunalia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Dunalia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty dunalia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Its seeds are often encased in pods, and the plant may play a role in nitrogen fixation due to its legume classification.</p>
<p>Dunalia ferruginea is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological and medicinal significance requires further scientific study.</p>
