                    <h1>Derris yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Derris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Chinese snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers and is known for its alkaloid-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition, particularly the presence of rotenone, a compound with pesticidal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
