                    <h1>Delphinium subglobosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium subglobosum, commonly known as the globular larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium subglobosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its toxic nature, due to the presence of alkaloids, requires caution when handling or planting near livestock and pets.</p>
