                    <h1>Didissandra giraldii</h1>
<p>Didissandra giraldii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy surface that repels water, helping to keep the plant afloat and reducing evaporation.</p>
