                    <h1>Didelotia letouzeyi</h1>
<p>Didelotia letouzeyi, commonly known as the Madagascan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Didelotia letouzeyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
