                    <h1>Davallia strigosa var. rhomboidea</h1>
<p>Davallia strigosa var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhomboid-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically grouped in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
