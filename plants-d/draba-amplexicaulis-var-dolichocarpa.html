                    <h1>Draba amplexicaulis var. dolichocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba amplexicaulis var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrowly elliptic, hairy leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its species name *amplexicaulis*. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are elongated and often more robust than in other varieties of *Draba*.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
