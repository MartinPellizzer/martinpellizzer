                    <h1>Dendrophthora meridana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora meridana, commonly known as the Mediterranean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by birds that consume the berries.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora meridana plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
