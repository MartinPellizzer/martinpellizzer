<p>Deprea sagasteguii, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deprea sagasteguii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
