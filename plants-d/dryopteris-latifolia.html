                    <h1>Dryopteris latifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris latifolia, commonly known as the broad female fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Asia, North America, and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
