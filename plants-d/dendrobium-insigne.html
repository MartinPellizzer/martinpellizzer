                    <h1>Dendrobium insigne</h1>
<p>Dendrobium insigne, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrobium insigne is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
