<p>Dalea versicolor subsp.</p>
<p>argyrostachya, commonly known as the silver-stem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compound leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
