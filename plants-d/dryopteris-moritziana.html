                    <h1>Dryopteris moritziana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
