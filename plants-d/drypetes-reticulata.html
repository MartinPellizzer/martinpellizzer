                    <h1>Drypetes reticulata</h1>
<p>Drypetes reticulata, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and distinctive reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
