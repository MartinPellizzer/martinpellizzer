<p>Dryopteris lanceolata var. tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive, finely hairy fronds.</p>
<p>This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are usually lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a serrated margin. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
