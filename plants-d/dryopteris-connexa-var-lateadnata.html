                    <h1>Dryopteris connexa var. lateadnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris connexa var. lateadnata, commonly known as the late-attaching wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are characterized by their broad, shield-shaped pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
