                    <h1>Dryopteris pentheri var. montana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pentheri var. montana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
