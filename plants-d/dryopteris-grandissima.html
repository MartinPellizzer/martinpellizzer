                    <h1>Dryopteris grandissima</h1>
<p>Dryopteris grandissima, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
