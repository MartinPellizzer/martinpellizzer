<p>Didymoglossum longisetum, commonly known as the long-haired bog moss, is a small, evergreen moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and closely arranged, ovate leaves that are often covered with long, stiff hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows, where it forms dense, cushion-like mats. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum longisetum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native wetland habitats.</p>
