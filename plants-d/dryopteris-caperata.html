<p>Dryopteris caperata, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus.
