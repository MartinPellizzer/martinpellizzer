                    <h1>Dryopteris caudiculata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris caudiculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are covered in a cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
