                    <h1>Dryopteris sparsa var. ryukyuensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sparsa var. ryukyuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu holly fern, is a fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clusters.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
