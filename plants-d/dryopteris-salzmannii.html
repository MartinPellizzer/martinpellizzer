<p>Dryopteris salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris salzmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, cool conditions.</p>
