<p>Dactylorhiza × aschersoniana nothosubsp.</p>
<p>predaensis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring acidic soils and moderate to high humidity. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability.</p>
