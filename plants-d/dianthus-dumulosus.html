<p>Dianthus dumulosus, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>Dianthus dumulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardiness and ability to tolerate cold climates.</p>
