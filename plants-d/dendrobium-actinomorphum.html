<p>Dendrobium actinomorphum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium actinomorphum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
