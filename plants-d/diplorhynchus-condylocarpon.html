                    <h1>Diplorhynchus condylocarpon</h1>
<p>Diplorhynchus condylocarpon, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplorhynchus condylocarpon plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
