                    <h1>Dendrophthora oligantha</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora oligantha, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain additional energy. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora oligantha plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife.</p>
