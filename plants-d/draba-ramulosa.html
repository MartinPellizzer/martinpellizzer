                    <h1>Draba ramulosa</h1>
<p>Draba ramulosa, commonly known as the cushion draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, compact cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Draba ramulosa is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation.</p>
