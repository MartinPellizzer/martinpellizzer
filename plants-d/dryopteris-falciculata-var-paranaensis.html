                    <h1>Dryopteris falciculata var. paranaensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris falciculata var. paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana holly fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Dryopteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and prefers well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, evergreen foliage.</p>
