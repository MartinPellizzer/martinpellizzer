<p>Diplostephium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow stinging nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritating chemicals upon contact. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its stinging properties, it is often avoided, but it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
