                    <h1>Donax conferta</h1>
<p>Donax conferta, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Donax conferta thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
