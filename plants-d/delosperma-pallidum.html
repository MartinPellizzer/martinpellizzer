<p>Delosperma pallidum, commonly known as the pale stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs.</p>
