<p>Dendropemon caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near water sources such as mangroves or coastal areas. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
