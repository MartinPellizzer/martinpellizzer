<p>Dracontium angustispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by spadices, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
