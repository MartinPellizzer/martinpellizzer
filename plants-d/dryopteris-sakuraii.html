                <h1>Dryopteris sakuraii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the natural habitat.</p>
