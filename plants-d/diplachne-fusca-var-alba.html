<p>Diplachne fusca var. alba, commonly known as white false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale brown florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Diplachne fusca var. alba is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
