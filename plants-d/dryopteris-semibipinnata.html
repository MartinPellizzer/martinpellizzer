                    <h1>Dryopteris semibipinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris semibipinnata, commonly known as the semi-bipinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are semi-bipinnate, meaning they have a secondary division of pinnae that are not fully divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
