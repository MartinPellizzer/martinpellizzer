                    <h1>Dianthus carthusianorum f. atrisquamatus</h1>
<p>Dianthus carthusianorum f. atrisquamatus, commonly known as the Black Squamate Carnation, is a rare and striking variant of the carnation family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black petals, which contrast sharply with its white or pale pink centers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
