                    <h1>Desmanthus michelii</h1>
<p>Desmanthus michelii, commonly known as the Mexican needlepod, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
