<p>Dockrillia chordiformis, commonly known as the ribbon dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dockrillia chordiformis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
