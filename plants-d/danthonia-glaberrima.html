<p>Danthonia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are generally smooth and lack the coarse texture found in many other grass species. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Danthonia glaberrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
