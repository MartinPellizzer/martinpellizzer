                    <h1>Dondia torreyana</h1>
<p>Dondia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Atriplex and Amaranthus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
