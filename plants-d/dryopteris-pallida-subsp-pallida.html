<p>Dryopteris pallida subsp.</p>
<p>pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
