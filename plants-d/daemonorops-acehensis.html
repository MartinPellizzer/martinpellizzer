<p>Daemonorops acehensis, commonly known as the Aceh pandan, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in local cuisines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in fibrous, woody pods and are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops acehensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
