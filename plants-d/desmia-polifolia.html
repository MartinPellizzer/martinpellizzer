                    <h1>Desmia polifolia</h1>
<p>Desmia polifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, dense growth of leaf-like structures covered in a layer of fine, woolly hairs. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
