<p>Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp.</p>
<p>thermale, commonly known as the hot spring grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm, wet habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist soils near springs and along stream banks, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
