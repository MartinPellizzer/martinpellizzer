<p>Diaphananthe welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 2,000 years, making it one of the oldest living organisms on Earth. It has adapted to survive in arid conditions by storing water in its trunk and having a specialized root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject of study in desert ecology and plant adaptation.</p>
