                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. marina</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. marina, commonly known as sea bent grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern, which helps stabilize sandy or saline soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in maritime environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it valuable for erosion control and habitat restoration in coastal areas.</p>
