<p>Dasylirion cedrosanum, commonly known as Cedros Island sotol, is a succulent plant native to the coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray, strap-like leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
