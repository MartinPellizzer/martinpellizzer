                    <h1>Dichocarpum adiantifolium var. sutchuenense</h1>
<p>Dichocarpum adiantifolium var. sutchuenense, commonly known as the Sichuan fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of the maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
