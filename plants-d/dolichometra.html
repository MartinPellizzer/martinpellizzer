<p>Dolichometra, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically thrive in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring warm, humid climates. Dolichometra species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats.</p>
