                    <h1>Dendrophthoe homoplastica</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe homoplastica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves and chlorophyll, relying on its host for support rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
