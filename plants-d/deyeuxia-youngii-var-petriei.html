<p>Deyeuxia youngii var. petriei, commonly known as the Petrie's false brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets along their length. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikelets with leathery, lanceolate lemmae, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
