                    <h1>Dryopteris × subaustriaca</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × subaustriaca, commonly known as the Austrian shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris filix-mas and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
