                    <h1>Dryopteris ampla var. subdryopteris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ampla var. subdryopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rich, deciduous forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
