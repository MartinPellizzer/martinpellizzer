                    <h1>Dryopteris wuyuanensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris wuyuanensis, commonly known as the Wuyuan water fern, is a species of polypod fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
