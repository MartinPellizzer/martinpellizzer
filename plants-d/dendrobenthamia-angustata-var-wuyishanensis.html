<p>Dendrobenthamia angustata var. wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyishan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Wuyi Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, terete pseudobulbs and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
