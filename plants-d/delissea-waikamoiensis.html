<p>Delissea waikamoiensis, commonly known as the Waikamoi fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique botanical species.</p>
