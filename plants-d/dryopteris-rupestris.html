<p>Dryopteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows on rocky slopes and in woodland areas, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features fronds that are leathery and deeply divided, often with a dark green coloration. It produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered around the veins.</p>
<p>Dryopteris rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
