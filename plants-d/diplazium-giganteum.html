<p>Diplazium giganteum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green and can float on the water surface or hang submerged, depending on the water depth.</p>
