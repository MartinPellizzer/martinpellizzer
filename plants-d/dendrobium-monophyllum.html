                    <h1>Dendrobium monophyllum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium monophyllum, commonly known as the white orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium monophyllum is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
