                    <h1>Daniellia ogea</h1>
<p>Daniellia ogea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, simple leaves that are typically alternate and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. Daniellia ogea is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has historically been used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
