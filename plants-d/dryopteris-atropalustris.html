                    <h1>Dryopteris atropalustris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris atropalustris, commonly known as the black moss fern, is a species of polypod fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically shorter than those of other ferns in the genus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
