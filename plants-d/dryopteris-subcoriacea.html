<p>Dryopteris subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through underground growth.</p>
