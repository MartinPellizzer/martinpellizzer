                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis f. atrorubens</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis f. atrorubens, commonly known as the purple-red marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as peat bogs and marshes. It has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
