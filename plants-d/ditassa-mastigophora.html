                    <h1>Ditassa mastigophora</h1>
<p>Ditassa mastigophora, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a unique structure that allows for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The leaves are supported by long, hollow petioles that help maintain their buoyancy and structural integrity.</p>
