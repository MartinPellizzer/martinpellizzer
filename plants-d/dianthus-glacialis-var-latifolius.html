                    <h1>Dianthus glacialis var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Dianthus glacialis var. latifolius, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical Dianthus glacialis, giving it a slightly different appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh ecosystems.</p>
