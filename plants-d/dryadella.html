                    <h1>Dryadella</h1>
<p>Dryadella, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that resemble the shape of a four-leaf clover. They thrive in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where they form dense mats on the water surface. The leaves are usually submerged or floating, with tiny, thread-like roots that anchor them to the substrate.</p>
<p>Dryadella species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients.</p>
