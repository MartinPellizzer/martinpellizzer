<p>Dryopteris pseudobissetiana, commonly known as the Bisset's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its foliage.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
