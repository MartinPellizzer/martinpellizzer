                    <h1>Dactylorchis praetermissa var. cuspidata</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis praetermissa var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
