                    <h1>Danaea falcata</h1>
<p>Danaea falcata, commonly known as the sickleleaf torchflower, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble torches, which are primarily for attracting pollinators. The plant has elongated, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Danaea falcata is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant floral display.</p>
