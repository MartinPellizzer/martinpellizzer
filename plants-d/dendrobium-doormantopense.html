                    <h1>Dendrobium doormantopense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium doormantopense, commonly known as the Doormantopense orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
