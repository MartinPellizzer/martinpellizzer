                    <h1>Duthiastrum linifolium</h1>
<p>Duthiastrum linifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive silvery-gray upper surface covered in tiny, scale-like structures called rhizines. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form the lichen's unique structure. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
