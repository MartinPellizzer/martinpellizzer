                    <h1>Dalbergia lactea</h1>
<p>Dalbergia lactea, commonly known as the white sandwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes.</p>
