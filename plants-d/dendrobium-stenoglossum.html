<p>Dendrobium stenoglossum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive narrow lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium stenoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
