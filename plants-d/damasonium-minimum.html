<p>Damasonium minimum, commonly known as the lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
