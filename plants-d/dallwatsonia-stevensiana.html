                    <h1>Dallwatsonia stevensiana</h1>
<p>Dallwatsonia stevensiana, commonly known as the Stevns lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in the harsh maritime climate. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dallwatsonia stevensiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
