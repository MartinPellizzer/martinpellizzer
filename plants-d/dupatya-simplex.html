                    <h1>Dupatya simplex</h1>
<p>Dupatya simplex, commonly known as the simple leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, undivided fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
