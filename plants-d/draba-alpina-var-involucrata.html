                    <h1>Draba alpina var. involucrata</h1>
<p>Draba alpina var. involucrata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and low-nutrient conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The variety involucrata is distinguished by its dense, leaf-like involucral bracts that surround the flower cluster.</p>
