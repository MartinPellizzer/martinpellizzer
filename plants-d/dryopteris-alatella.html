                    <h1>Dryopteris alatella</h1>
<p>Dryopteris alatella, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that resemble a feather.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
