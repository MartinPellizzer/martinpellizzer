                    <h1>Dendroseris lacerata</h1>
<p>Dendroseris lacerata, commonly known as the lacerate lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
