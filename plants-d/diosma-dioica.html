                    <h1>Diosma dioica</h1>
<p>Diosma dioica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Diosma dioica is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in woodworking and as a source of dye.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range.</p>
