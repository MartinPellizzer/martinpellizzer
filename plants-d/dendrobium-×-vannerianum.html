                    <h1>Dendrobium × vannerianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × vannerianum, commonly known as the orchid with a complex hybrid origin, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from crosses between Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium phalaenopsis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its flowers are typically showy and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × vannerianum requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to maintain optimal growth and flowering.</p>
