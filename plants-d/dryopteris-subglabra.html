                    <h1>Dryopteris subglabra</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subglabra, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are smooth to the touch.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types once established.</p>
