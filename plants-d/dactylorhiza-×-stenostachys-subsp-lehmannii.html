<p>Dactylorhiza × stenostachys subsp.</p>
<p>lehmannii, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, flowering stems with clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome system.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Dactylorhiza sambucina and Dactylorhiza macdougallii.</p>
