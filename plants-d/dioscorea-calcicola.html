<p>Dioscorea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone yam, is a perennial vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are rich in starch and have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
