<p>Dieffenbachia isthmia, commonly known as the Giant Dieffenbachia, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, strikingly patterned, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spadix and a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children.</p>
