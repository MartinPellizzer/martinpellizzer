                    <h1>Dryopteris vestita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
