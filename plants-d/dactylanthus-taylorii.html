                    <h1>Dactylanthus taylorii</h1>
<p>Dactylanthus taylorii, commonly known as the Christmas flower, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, red or purple flower that opens only at night. Its flowering period occurs between August and December, coinciding with the southern hemisphere's winter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
