                    <h1>Dentella stolonifera</h1>
<p>Dentella stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Dentella stolonifera is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
