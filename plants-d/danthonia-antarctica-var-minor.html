                    <h1>Danthonia antarctica var. minor</h1>
<p>Danthonia antarctica var. minor, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of ecological studies in extreme climates.</p>
