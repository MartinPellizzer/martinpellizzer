<p>Deroemera calva, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Cape Province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deroemera calva is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
