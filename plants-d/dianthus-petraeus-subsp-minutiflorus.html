<p>Dianthus petraeus subsp.</p>
<p>minutiflorus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude conditions.</p>
