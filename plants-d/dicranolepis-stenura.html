<p>Dicranolepis stenura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and is typically found on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often tightly clustered around its short, rhizomatous stem. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Dicranolepis stenura is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates and thrives in humid, tropical or subtropical climates.</p>
