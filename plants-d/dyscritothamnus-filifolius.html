<p>Dyscritothamnus filifolius, commonly known as the silky feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Dyscritothamnus filifolius is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
