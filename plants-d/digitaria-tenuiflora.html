                    <h1>Digitaria tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Digitaria tenuiflora, commonly known as slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Digitaria tenuiflora is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
