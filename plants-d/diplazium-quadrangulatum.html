                    <h1>Diplazium quadrangulatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-cornered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboidal (four-cornered) fronds, which give it its scientific name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Diplazium quadrangulatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
