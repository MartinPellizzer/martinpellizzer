<p>Daemonorops intumescens, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
