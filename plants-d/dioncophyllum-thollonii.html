<p>Dioncophyllum thollonii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a climbing habit, with woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
