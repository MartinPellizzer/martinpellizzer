<p>Diplazium hellwigii, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a golden hue. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
