                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. incanescens</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. incanescens, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a cluster of eight, giving it its species name "octopetala.". It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its frost-laced, whitish underside on the leaves, which contributes to its incanescens designation.</p>
