<p>Dipcadi reidii, commonly known as the Reed's onion, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
