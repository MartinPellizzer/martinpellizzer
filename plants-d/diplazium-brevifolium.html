                    <h1>Diplazium brevifolium</h1>
<p>Diplazium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often rhizoidal, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
