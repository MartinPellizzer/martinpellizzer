                    <h1>Dendrophthoe chrysanthoides</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe chrysanthoides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
