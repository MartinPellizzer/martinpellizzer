                    <h1>Dorycnium herbaceum</h1>
<p>Dorycnium herbaceum, commonly known as the lesser burclover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed pods containing seeds with hooked spines. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in open, sandy areas.</p>
<p>Dorycnium herbaceum is characterized by its distinctive seed dispersal mechanism, which relies on animals and humans to carry the hooked seeds to new locations.</p>
