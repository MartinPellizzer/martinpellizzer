<p>Diplazium praelongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium praelongum is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
