<p>Dudleya saxosa subsp.</p>
<p>collomiae, commonly known as the Collom's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
