                    <h1>Daemonorops siberutensis</h1>
<p>Daemonorops siberutensis, commonly known as the Siberut palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the islands of Siberut and other parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its cones, which develop after flowering, contain the seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Daemonorops siberutensis is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
