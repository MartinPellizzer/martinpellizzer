                    <h1>Dactylorhiza pycnantha</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, moist soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces dense clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers. Its root system includes a network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, a characteristic common among many orchids.</p>
