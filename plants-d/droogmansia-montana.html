                    <h1>Droogmansia montana</h1>
<p>Droogmansia montana, commonly known as the mountain droogmansia, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
