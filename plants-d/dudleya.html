                    <h1>Dudleya</h1>
<p>Dudleya, commonly known as liveforever, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to coastal regions of California and Baja California, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Dudleya species are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing them to store moisture efficiently. They produce vibrant flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their hardiness and low maintenance, Dudleya plants are popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
