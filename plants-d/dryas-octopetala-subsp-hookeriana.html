<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's dryas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters of eight, giving it the species name "octopetala.".</p>
<p>The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays an important role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
