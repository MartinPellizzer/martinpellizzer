                    <h1>Deyeuxia compacta</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia compacta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
