                    <h1>Deprea sapalachensis</h1>
<p>Deprea sapalachensis, commonly known as the Sapa≈Çacz mountain bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Carpathian Mountains of Poland.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deprea sapalachensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
