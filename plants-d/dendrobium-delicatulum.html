<p>Dendrobium delicatulum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces slender, linear pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Dendrobium delicatulum prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
