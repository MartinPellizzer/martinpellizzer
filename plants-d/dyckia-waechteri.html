                    <h1>Dyckia waechteri</h1>
<p>Dyckia waechteri, commonly known as the Waechter's Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
