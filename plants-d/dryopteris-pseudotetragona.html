<p>Dryopteris pseudotetragona, commonly known as the four-angled wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
