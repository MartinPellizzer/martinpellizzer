<p>Delimopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Delimopsis has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of white or pale green.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
