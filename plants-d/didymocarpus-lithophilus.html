                    <h1>Didymocarpus lithophilus</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus lithophilus, commonly known as the rock pear, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody structure and preference for growing on rocky substrates, which contributes to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and pear-shaped. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh, rocky environments, making it an important subject in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
