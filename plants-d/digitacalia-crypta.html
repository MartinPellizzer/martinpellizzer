                    <h1>Digitacalia crypta</h1>
<p>Digitacalia crypta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Digitacalia crypta is considered endangered.</p>
