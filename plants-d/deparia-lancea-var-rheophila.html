<p>Deparia lancea var. rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a variant of the broad fern species native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in stream banks and wetlands, where it thrives in consistently damp soil conditions. The plant features lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves are adapted for efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riparian areas.</p>
