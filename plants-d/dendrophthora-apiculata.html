                    <h1>Dendrophthora apiculata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora apiculata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora apiculata plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
