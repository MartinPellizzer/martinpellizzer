<p>Dianthus crinitus subsp.</p>
<p>nuristanicus, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Nuristan carnation, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers with a distinctive frilled petal appearance.</p>
