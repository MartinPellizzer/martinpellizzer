<p>Dryopteris eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
