<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Delphinium triste is known for its striking appearance, though it is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids in its tissues.</p>
