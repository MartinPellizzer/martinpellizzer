                    <h1>Decalophium</h1>
<p>Decalophium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble orchids, despite not being closely related to the true orchid family. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Decalophium species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in many regions.</p>
