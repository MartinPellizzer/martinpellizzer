                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. decalcata</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. decalcata, commonly known as the calcined grass or calcium grass, is a variant of the common sheep's fescue.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced calcium content compared to the typical variety, which makes it more suitable for certain soil conditions. This plant is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, often in areas with lower nutrient levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in less fertile soils.</p>
