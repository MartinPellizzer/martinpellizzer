<p>Dendrobium eriiflorum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically red or orange with contrasting green veins, making it visually striking.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
