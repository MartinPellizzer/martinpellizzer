<p>Diplazium procerum, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium procerum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
