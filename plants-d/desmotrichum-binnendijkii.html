<p>Desmotrichum binnendijkii, commonly known as the Binnendijk's desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
