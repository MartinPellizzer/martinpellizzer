                    <h1>Ditaxis mercurialina</h1>
<p>Ditaxis mercurialina, commonly known as the silverleaf dittany, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
