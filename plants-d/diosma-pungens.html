<p>Diosma pungens, commonly known as the spiked diosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Diosma pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
