<p>Dracophyllum involucratum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Dracophyllum involucratum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
