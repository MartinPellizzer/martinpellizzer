<p>Dryopteris gaoligongensis, commonly known as the Gaoligong Mountain fern, is a species of shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests at high elevations. The plant features a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery rachis and lance-shaped pinnae. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
