<p>Dorcoceras clarkeanum, commonly known as the Clarke's sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and elongated shape. The plant, though marine, exhibits unique botanical features such as a radula for feeding on algae and a mantle that secretes a protective mucus. It does not have true roots, stems, or leaves, making it distinct from terrestrial plants.</p>
<p>Instead, it thrives in marine environments, contributing to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>
