                    <h1>Draba cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Draba cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba cuneifolia is adapted to cold climates and grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing early-season nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile alpine ecosystems.</p>
