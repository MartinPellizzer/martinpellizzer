                    <h1>Dendrobium sulphuratum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sulphuratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's unique coloration and growth pattern make it a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts.</p>
