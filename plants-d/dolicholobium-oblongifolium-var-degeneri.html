                    <h1>Dolicholobium oblongifolium var. degeneri</h1>
<p>Dolicholobium oblongifolium var. degeneri, commonly known as the Degener's broadleaf dolicholobium, is a rare and unique variant of the dolicholobium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, broad leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant exhibits a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
