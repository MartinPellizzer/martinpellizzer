<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, with lobed or toothed margins, and the flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
