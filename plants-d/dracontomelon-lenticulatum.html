<p>Dracontomelon lenticulatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
