                    <h1>Dendrophthoe obovata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative ecological impacts on its host trees.</p>
