                    <h1>Dryopteris pachysora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pachysora, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
