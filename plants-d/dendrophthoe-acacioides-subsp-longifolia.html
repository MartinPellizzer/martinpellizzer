<p>Dendrophthoe acacioides subsp.</p>
<p>longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily acacia species. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
