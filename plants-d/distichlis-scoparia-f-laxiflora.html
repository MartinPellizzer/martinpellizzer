                    <h1>Distichlis scoparia f. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Distichlis scoparia f. laxiflora, commonly known as the coastal saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing shorelines.</p>
