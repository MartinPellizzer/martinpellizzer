                    <h1>Dendrophylax</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes long, narrow leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Dendrophylax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
