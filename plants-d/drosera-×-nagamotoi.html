                    <h1>Drosera × nagamotoi</h1>
<p>Drosera × nagamotoi, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera tokai.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves, which trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating carnivorous behavior.</p>
