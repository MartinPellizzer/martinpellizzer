                    <h1>Dendrobium × yengiliense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × yengiliense, commonly known as the Yengiliense orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with colors ranging from white to pink and yellow, and are often fragrant.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × yengiliense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
