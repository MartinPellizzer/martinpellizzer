<p>Diasperus macrochorion, commonly known as the large-chambered sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Echinoidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its calcareous skeleton, which forms a disc-shaped structure with a central cavity and radial chambers. The plant, or more accurately the animal, is found in shallow coastal waters and sandy substrates. Its skeleton is covered with fine spines and is often used as a substrate for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>The structure of its skeleton provides insights into its ecological role and evolutionary adaptations in marine environments.</p>
