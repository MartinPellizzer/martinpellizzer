<p>Diplazium crenauritum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, floating leaves that are divided into fine, feather-like segments. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Diplazium crenauritum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
