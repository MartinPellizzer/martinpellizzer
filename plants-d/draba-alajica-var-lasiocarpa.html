                    <h1>Draba alajica var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba alajica var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a compact rosette of basal leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its adaptation to harsh mountainous climates.</p>
