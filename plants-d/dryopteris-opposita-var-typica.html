                    <h1>Dryopteris opposita var. typica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris opposita var. typica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
