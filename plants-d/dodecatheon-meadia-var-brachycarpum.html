<p>Dodecatheon meadia var. brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-carpel globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often hairy as well. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The varietal name "brachycarpum" refers to its shorter carpels, a distinguishing feature from the typical form of Dodecatheon meadia.</p>
