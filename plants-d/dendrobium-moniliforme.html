<p>Dendrobium moniliforme, commonly known as the bead orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, bead-like pseudobulbs along its stem, which store water and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Dendrobium moniliforme is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
