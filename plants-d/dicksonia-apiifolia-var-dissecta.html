<p>Dicksonia apiifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in coastal and forested areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
