<p>Dendrobium quisumbingii, commonly known as the Quezon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>

The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium quisumbingii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
