                    <h1>Dryopteris poyseri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris poyseri, commonly known as Poyser's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
