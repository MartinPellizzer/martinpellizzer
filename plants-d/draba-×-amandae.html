                    <h1>Draba × amandae</h1>
<p>Draba × amandae, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba incana, characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a mat-like growth pattern. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Draba × amandae is found in mountainous regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
