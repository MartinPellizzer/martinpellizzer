<p>Diplotaxis virgata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved African dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to disperse seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
