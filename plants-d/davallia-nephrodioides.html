                    <h1>Davallia nephrodioides</h1>
<p>Davallia nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid conditions with well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
