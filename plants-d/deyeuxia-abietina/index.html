                            <h1>Deyeuxia Abietina</h1>
<p>Bluegrass, scientifically known as Deyeuxia abietina, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils, often growing in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its fine, dark green foliage and its ability to form dense, attractive turf. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Deyeuxia abietina plays a crucial role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
