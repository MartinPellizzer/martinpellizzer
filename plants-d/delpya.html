<p>Delpya, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves, which are typically divided into small, lobed segments resembling the leaves of clover. Delpya species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, with Delpya muscoides being one of the most commonly encountered.</p>
