<p>Daphnopsis emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate daphnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>

The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat.</p>
