                    <h1>Dryopteris fibrillosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fibrillosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous material, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
