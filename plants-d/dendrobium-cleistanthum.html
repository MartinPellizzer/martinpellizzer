<p>Dendrobium cleistanthum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
