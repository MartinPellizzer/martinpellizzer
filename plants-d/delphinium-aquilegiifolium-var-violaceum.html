                    <h1>Delphinium aquilegiifolium var. violaceum</h1>
<p>Delphinium aquilegiifolium var. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-leaved larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of violet to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply divided, resembling those of the genus Aquilegia, hence its specific epithet. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
