<p>Dodecatheon hendersonii subsp.</p>
<p>parvifolium, commonly known as the Henderson's five-petaled bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, elongated capsules that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
