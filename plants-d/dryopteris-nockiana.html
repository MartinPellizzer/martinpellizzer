                    <h1>Dryopteris nockiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nockiana, commonly known as the Nock's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>The Nock's wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
