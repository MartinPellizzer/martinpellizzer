                            <h1>Dentaria × Paxiana</h1>
<p>Purple coneflower, scientifically known as Dentaria × paxiana, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family native to the central United States. This hybrid plant is celebrated for its vibrant purple petals and distinctive cone-shaped center, making it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits, such as supporting pollinators, have contributed to its growing popularity in native plant gardens. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively underappreciated species in the broader horticultural community.</p>
