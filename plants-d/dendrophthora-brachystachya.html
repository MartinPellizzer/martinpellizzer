                    <h1>Dendrophthora brachystachya</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the host tree's health and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
