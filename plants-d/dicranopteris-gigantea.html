<p>Dicranopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
