<p>Dolichogyne rigida, commonly known as the rigid long-body mite, is a species of acarid belonging to the family Dolichogynidae.</p>
<p>It is a small, spider-like arachnid that primarily feeds on other mites and small insects. This plant-associated mite is often found in humid environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Dolichogyne rigida is characterized by its elongated body and robust legs, which aid in its movement through dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, biodiverse ecosystem.</p>
