<p>Dryopteris qandoensis, commonly known as the Qando fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The Qando fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
