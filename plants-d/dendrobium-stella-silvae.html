<p>Dendrobium stella-silvae, commonly known as the star forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a striking star-like appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
