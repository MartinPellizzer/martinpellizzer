                    <h1>Danthonia antarctica</h1>
<p>Danthonia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is particularly adapted to high-altitude and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in rocky soils and is a key component of alpine vegetation in regions such as New Zealand and southern South America.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important plant for stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
