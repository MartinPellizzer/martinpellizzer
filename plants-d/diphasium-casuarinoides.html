<p>Diphasium casuarinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other native Australian trees, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, supporting various bird species that feed on its fruit.</p>
