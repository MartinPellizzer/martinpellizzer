                <h1>Dactylorhiza kerneriorum</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza kerneriorum, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it can grow on other plants or rocks, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
