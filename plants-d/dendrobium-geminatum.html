                    <h1>Dendrobium geminatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium geminatum, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its stems are typically short and thick, and it has long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Dendrobium geminatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
