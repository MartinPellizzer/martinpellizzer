                    <h1>Dryas octopetala f. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mountain avens, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features compact, low-growing stems with hairy, dark green leaves that are typically entire, giving it its "integrifolia" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
