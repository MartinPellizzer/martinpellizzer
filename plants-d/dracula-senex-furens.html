                    <h1>Dracula senex-furens</h1>
<p>Dracula senex-furens, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
