                    <h1>Dichaea melunae</h1>
<p>Dichaea melunae, commonly known as the Melun's dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth is slow, and it is often found growing in association with other epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea melunae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
