                    <h1>Doodia caudata var. scolopendrium</h1>
<p>Doodia caudata var. scolopendrium, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
