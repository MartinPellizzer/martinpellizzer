                    <h1>Dryadella toscanoi</h1>
<p>Dryadella toscanoi, commonly known as the Tuscan dryad, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
