<p>Donella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Donella is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
