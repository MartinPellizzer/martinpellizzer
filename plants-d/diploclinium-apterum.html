<p>Diploclinium apterum, commonly known as the smooth thorn vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.
