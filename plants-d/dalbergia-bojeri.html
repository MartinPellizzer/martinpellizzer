<p>Dalbergia bojeri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in savannas and woodlands, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Dalbergia bojeri is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
