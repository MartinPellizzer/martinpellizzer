                    <h1>Drynaria persicariifolia</h1>
<p>Drynaria persicariifolia, commonly known as the Persian fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a true fern, though it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range.</p>
