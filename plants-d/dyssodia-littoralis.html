                    <h1>Dyssodia littoralis</h1>
<p>Dyssodia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Dyssodia littoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
