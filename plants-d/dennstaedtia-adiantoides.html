<p>Dennstaedtia adiantoides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the genus Adiantum, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves.</p>
