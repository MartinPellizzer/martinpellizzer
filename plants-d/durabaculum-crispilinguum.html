                    <h1>Durabaculum crispilinguum</h1>
<p>Durabaculum crispilinguum, commonly known as the silver-leafed mountainbush, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale blue and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, waxy hairs that reduce water loss and protect against intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Durabaculum crispilinguum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
