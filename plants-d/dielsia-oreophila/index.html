                            <h1>Dielsia Oreophila</h1>
<p>Dielsia oreophila is a rare and fascinating plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its unique, delicate appearance. This species is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecosystem, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its study provides valuable insights into the biodiversity of high-altitude flora.</p>
