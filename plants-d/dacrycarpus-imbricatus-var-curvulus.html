                    <h1>Dacrycarpus imbricatus var. curvulus</h1>
<p>Dacrycarpus imbricatus var. curvulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kahikatea, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often growing in association with other native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
