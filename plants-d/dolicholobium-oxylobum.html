<p>Dolicholobium oxylobum, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiny, bract-covered seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dolicholobium oxylobum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
