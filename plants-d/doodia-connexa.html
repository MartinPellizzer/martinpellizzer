<p>Doodia connexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along the margins of ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, contributing to its ornamental value in water gardens. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Doodia connexa is valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and reducing algae growth.</p>
