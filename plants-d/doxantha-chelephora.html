                    <h1>Doxantha chelephora</h1>
<p>Doxantha chelephora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than typical orchid leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or yellow, which help it blend into its forest habitat. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
