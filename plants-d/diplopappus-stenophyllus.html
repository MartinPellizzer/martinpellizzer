<p>Diplopappus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, which facilitates wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
