<p>Delosperma peersii, commonly known as the silver leaf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically during the spring and summer months. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
