                    <h1>Dryopteris esterhuyseniae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
