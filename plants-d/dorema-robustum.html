<p>Dorema robustum, commonly known as the mountain thyme or rock thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and aromatic, tiny, grey-green leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Dorema robustum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
