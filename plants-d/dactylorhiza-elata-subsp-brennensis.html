<p>Dactylorhiza elata subsp.</p>
<p>brennensis, commonly known as the Burnet orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and is typically found in acidic, moist habitats such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers with elongated, narrow petals. It is closely related to other members of the Dactylorhiza genus, which are known for their terrestrial growth habits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
