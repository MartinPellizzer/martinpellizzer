                    <h1>Dictyogramme smithii</h1>
<p>Dictyogramme smithii, commonly known as the Smith's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in swampy or marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
