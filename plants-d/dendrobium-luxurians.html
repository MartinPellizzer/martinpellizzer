<p>Dendrobium luxurians, commonly known as the orchid with golden flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branched stem covered in dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium luxurians is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
