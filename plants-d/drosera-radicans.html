                    <h1>Drosera radicans</h1>
<p>Drosera radicans, commonly known as the carpeted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, trailing stems that form dense mats. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
