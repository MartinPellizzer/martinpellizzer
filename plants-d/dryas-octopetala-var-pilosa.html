                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray foliage covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and have a woolly texture due to the fine pubescence.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
