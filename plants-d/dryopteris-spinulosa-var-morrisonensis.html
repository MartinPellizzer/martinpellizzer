                    <h1>Dryopteris spinulosa var. morrisonensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spinulosa var. morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's wood fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
