                    <h1>Dyckia velascana</h1>
<p>Dyckia velascana, commonly known as the Velasco's Dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia velascana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
