<p>Decorsea grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features striking, star-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental element to its appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
