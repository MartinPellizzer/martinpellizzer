                    <h1>Deparia × musashiensis</h1>
<p>Deparia × musashiensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Japan. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
