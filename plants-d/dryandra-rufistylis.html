                    <h1>Dryandra rufistylis</h1>
<p>Dryandra rufistylis, commonly known as the red-styled dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red, with a prominent, reddish style that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in heathlands and is adapted to the region's nutrient-poor soils and seasonal rainfall patterns. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
