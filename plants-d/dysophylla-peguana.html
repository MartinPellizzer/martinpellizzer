                    <h1>Dysophylla peguana</h1>
<p>Dysophylla peguana, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, ghostly white flowers that bloom in the undergrowth of dense forests. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Dysophylla peguana is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
