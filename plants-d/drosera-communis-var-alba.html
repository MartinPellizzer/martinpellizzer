<p>Drosera communis var. alba, commonly known as the white sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white coating that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
