<p>It features fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
