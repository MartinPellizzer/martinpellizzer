                    <h1>Dendrophthoe corynitis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe corynitis, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it a significant ecological concern in some areas.</p>
