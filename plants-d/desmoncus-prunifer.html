                    <h1>Desmoncus prunifer</h1>
<p>Desmoncus prunifer, commonly known as the apple tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on tree bark, particularly on apple and other fruit trees.</p>
<p>It has a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface that becomes more pronounced as the lichen matures. The lichen contains a variety of secondary metabolites, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its chemical complexity. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees are abundant.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of air quality and can be used in ecological assessments.</p>
