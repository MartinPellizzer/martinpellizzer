                    <h1>Distichlis scoparia var. erinacea</h1>
<p>Distichlis scoparia var. erinacea, commonly known as the sea bulrush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and brackish wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing soils and filtering water.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance makes it a key species in coastal ecosystem restoration projects.</p>
