<p>Dryopteris faberi, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
