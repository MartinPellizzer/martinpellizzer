                    <h1>Dryopteris sprucei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce Fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
