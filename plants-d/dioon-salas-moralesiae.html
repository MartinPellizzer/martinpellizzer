                    <h1>Dioon salas-moralesiae</h1>
<p>Dioon salas-moralesiae, commonly known as the Salas-Moralesia cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a unique subject of study in botany and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
