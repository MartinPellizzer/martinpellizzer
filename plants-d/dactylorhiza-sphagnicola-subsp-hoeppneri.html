<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola subsp.</p>
<p>hoeppneri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain parts of Europe. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, dark green leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers in late summer. It is closely related to other Dactylorhiza species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
