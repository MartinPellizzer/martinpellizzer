<p>Distichlis eludens, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other arid or saline habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
