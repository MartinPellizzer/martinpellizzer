<p>Dryopteris parishii, commonly known as the Parish's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Dryopteris parishii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
