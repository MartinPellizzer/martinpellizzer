                    <h1>Digitaria nodosa</h1>
<p>Digitaria nodosa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Digitaria nodosa is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil quality.</p>
