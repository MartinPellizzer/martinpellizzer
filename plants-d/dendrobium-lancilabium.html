<p>Dendrobium lancilabium, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of roots. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lancilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
