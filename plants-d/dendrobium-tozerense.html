                    <h1>Dendrobium tozerense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium tozerense, commonly known as the Tozer's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that elongate over time, and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and cream. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium tozerense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat.</p>
