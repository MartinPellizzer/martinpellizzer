<p>Dendrobium delumbe, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with numerous short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.

<p>Dendrobium delumbe thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
