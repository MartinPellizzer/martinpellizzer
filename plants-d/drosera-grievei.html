<p>Drosera grievei, commonly known as the Grieve's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey.</p>
<p>Drosera grievei is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured insects.</p>
