<p>Drimys winteri f. revoluta, commonly known as the Chilean winter's bark, is a unique variant of the Drimys winteri species.</p>
<p>It is native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and is characterized by its dark, peeling bark that resembles the texture of winter's bark. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
