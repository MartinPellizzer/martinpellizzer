                    <h1>Draba oligosperma var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba oligosperma var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-capsule whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of basal leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Draba oligosperma var. leiocarpa is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
