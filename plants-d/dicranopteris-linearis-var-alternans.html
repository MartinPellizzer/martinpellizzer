<p>Dicranopteris linearis var. alternans, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually alternate on the stems, giving the plant its varietal name "alternans.".</p>
