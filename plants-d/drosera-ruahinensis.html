<p>Drosera ruahinensis, commonly known as the Ruahine dewplant, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of mucilage, which helps in the adhesion and digestion of prey.</p>
<p>Drosera ruahinensis is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within the Ruahine Range.</p>
