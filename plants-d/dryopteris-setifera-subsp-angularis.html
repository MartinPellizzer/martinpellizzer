<p>Dryopteris setifera subsp.</p>
<p>angularis, commonly known as the angular sword fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are often recurved and have a distinctive angular appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
