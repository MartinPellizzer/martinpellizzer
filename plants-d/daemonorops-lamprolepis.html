                    <h1>Daemonorops lamprolepis</h1>
<p>Daemonorops lamprolepis, commonly known as the silver-leaf cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-blue coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>
