                    <h1>Dioon planifolium</h1>
<p>Dioon planifolium, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a species of cycad native to the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically growing at the base of the plant and female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil and is of significant botanical interest.</p>
