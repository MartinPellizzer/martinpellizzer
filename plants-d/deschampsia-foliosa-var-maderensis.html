                    <h1>Deschampsia foliosa var. maderensis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia foliosa var. maderensis, commonly known as Mader's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
