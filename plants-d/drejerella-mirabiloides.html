                    <h1>Drejerella mirabiloides</h1>
<p>Drejerella mirabiloides, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to the humid forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that resemble small lanterns, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain water in its native environment.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Drejerella mirabiloides is relatively rare and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation.</p>
