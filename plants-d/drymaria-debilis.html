                    <h1>Drymaria debilis</h1>
<p>Drymaria debilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
