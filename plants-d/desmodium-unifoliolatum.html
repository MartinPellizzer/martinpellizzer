                    <h1>Desmodium unifoliolatum</h1>
<p>Desmodium unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single leaf desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive single leaflet per leaf, with the leaflets being heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
