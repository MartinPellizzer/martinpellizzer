                    <h1>Drepanocarpus mucronulatus</h1>
<p>Drepanocarpus mucronulatus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing nutrients to its host and supporting wildlife.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in shaded, forested environments where it can access sunlight through its host.</p>
