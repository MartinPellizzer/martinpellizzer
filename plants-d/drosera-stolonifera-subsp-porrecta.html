<p>Drosera stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>porrecta, commonly known as the sprawling sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which bloom in summer. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats over time.</p>
