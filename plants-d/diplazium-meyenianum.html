<p>Diplazium meyenianum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
