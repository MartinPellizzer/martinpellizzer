<p>Demorchis ballii, commonly known as the Ballii's demorchis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Demorchis ballii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
