                    <h1>Deyeuxia sylvatica var. turfosa</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia sylvatica var. turfosa, commonly known as the fine-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, wet meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
