<p>Dryopteris heteroptera, commonly known as the heteroptera fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
