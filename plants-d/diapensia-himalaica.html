                    <h1>Diapensia himalaica</h1>
<p>Diapensia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan diapensia, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense cushions or mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Diapensia himalaica is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or alpine tundra habitats.</p>
