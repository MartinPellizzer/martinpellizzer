<p>Dryopteris gongylodes subsp.</p>
<p>propinqua, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sori that are clustered in lines.</p>
<p>The subspecies propinqua is distinguished by its broader and more robust fronds compared to the typical form of D. gongylodes.</p>
