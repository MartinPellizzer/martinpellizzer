                    <h1>Dryopteris tenuissima</h1>
<p>Dryopteris tenuissima, commonly known as the Japanese spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
