                    <h1>Dyckia inflexifolia</h1>
<p>Dyckia inflexifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with a dense, fibrous covering that helps retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, vibrant orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia inflexifolia is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance.</p>
