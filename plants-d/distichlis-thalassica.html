                    <h1>Distichlis thalassica</h1>
<p>Distichlis thalassica, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a halophytic plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, grass-like growth habit and salt-tolerant adaptations that allow it to thrive in saline environments. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Distichlis thalassica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
