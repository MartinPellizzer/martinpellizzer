<p>Dendrosenecio elgonensis subsp.</p>
<p>barbatipes, commonly known as the Elgon Mountain Groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in Kenya and Uganda. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
