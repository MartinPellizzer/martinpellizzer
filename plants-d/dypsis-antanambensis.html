<p>Dypsis antanambensis, commonly known as the Madagascar bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnately compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
