<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Ireland, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories.</p>
