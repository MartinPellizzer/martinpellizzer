<p>Dryopteris saxifraga, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Dryopteris saxifraga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
