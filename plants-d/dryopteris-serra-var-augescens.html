                    <h1>Dryopteris serra var. augescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris serra var. augescens, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions.</p>
