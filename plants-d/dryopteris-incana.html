                    <h1>Dryopteris incana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris incana, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically biennial, developing from the rhizome each growing season. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery-white underside due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
