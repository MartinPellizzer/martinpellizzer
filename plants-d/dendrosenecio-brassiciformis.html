                    <h1>Dendrosenecio brassiciformis</h1>
<p>Dendrosenecio brassiciformis, commonly known as the "Cabbage Tree" or "Lobularia," is a unique member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in a terminal cluster, resembling a cabbage head, which is why it is often called the Cabbage Tree. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
