                            <h1>Drimia Capensis</h1>
<p>Drimia capensis is a striking plant native to southern Africa known for its tall, narrow leaves and showy white flowers. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found along the edges of cliffs and in sandy soils. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance. Its resilience and adaptability make it a popular choice for coastal and drought-tolerant landscapes. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and watering conditions to flourish.</p>
