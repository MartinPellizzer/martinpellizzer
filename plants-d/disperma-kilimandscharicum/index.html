                            <h1>Disperma Kilimandscharicum</h1>
<p>Kilimanjaro disperma, scientifically known as Disperma kilimandscharicum, is a rare and unique plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro. This flowering plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its alpine habitat. Its delicate structure and striking appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Due to its limited distribution and threats from climate change, the species is considered vulnerable. Protecting this plant is essential for preserving the biodiversity of East Africa's mountain ecosystems.</p>
