                    <h1>Dipteryx pteropus</h1>
<p>Dipteryx pteropus, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a towering tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces woody, angular pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. The tree has a deep root system and can live for hundreds of years, playing a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem. Its flowers are small and green, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The Brazil nut tree is also valued for its timber, though its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss.</p>
