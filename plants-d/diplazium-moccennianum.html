<p>Diplazium moccennianum, commonly known as the Moccennian shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
