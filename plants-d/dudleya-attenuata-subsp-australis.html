<p>Dudleya attenuata subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the coastal Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
