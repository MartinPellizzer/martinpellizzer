                    <h1>Davallia yaklaensis</h1>
<p>Davallia yaklaensis, commonly known as the Yakla fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
