                    <h1>Draba verna var. minutissima</h1>
<p>Draba verna var. minutissima, commonly known as the small-flowered whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically woolly or hairy, providing insulation in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and early blooming habit, it is an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
