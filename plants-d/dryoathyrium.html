                    <h1>Dryoathyrium</h1>
<p>Dryoathyrium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often floating fronds that are adapted to life in wet or waterlogged environments. They typically have small, slender leaves that can be either free-floating or anchored to substrates. Dryoathyrium species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal in moist conditions.</p>
