                    <h1>Dryopteris afzelii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris afzelii, commonly known as the European shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in its natural habitat.</p>
