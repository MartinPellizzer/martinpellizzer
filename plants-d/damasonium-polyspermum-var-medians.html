                    <h1>Damasonium polyspermum var. medians</h1>
<p>Damasonium polyspermum var. medians, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often submerged or just at the water's edge. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, enabling it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptability to varying water conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
