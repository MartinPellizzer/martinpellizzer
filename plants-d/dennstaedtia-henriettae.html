                    <h1>Dennstaedtia henriettae</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
