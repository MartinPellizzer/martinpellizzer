                    <h1>Diplazium limbatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium limbatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating fronds that are typically divided into broad, ovate segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
