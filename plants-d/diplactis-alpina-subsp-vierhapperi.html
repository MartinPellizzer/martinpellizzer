<p>Diplactis alpina subsp.</p>
<p>vierhapperi, commonly known as the Alpine Diplactis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is a perennial herb with a rosette growth form, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
