<p>Digitaria ischaemum, commonly known as common barnyardgrass, is a widespread annual grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into颖果 (glumes) containing tiny seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, agricultural fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
