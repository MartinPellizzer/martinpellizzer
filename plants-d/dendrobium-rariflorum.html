                    <h1>Dendrobium rariflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium rariflorum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
