<p>Dinebra decipiens subsp.</p>
<p>asthenes, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, hence its common name.</p>
