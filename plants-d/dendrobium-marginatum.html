<p>Dendrobium marginatum, commonly known as the golden tip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or brown lip, and they bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Dendrobium marginatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
