<p>Ditassa poeppigii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
