                    <h1>Draba pattersonii</h1>
<p>Draba pattersonii, commonly known as Patterson's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the high-elevation regions of the Sierra Nevada in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to the short growing season of its alpine habitat. Draba pattersonii has small, hairy leaves and produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
