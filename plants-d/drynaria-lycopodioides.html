                    <h1>Drynaria lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Drynaria lycopodioides, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are often scale-like in appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Drynaria lycopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
