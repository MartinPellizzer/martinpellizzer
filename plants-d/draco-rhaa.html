                    <h1>Draco rhaa</h1>
<p>Draco rhaa, commonly known as the dragon's tears plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a viscous, amber-colored resin from its leaves, which has been used traditionally in various cultural practices.</p>
<p>The resin is also believed to have medicinal properties, though further scientific study is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
