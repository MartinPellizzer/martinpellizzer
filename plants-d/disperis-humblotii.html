<p>Disperis humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Disperis humblotii is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction.</p>
