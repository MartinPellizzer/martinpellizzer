                    <h1>Drymonia macrantha</h1>
<p>Drymonia macrantha, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, supporting large, showy orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
