                    <h1>Dondia fernaldii</h1>
<p>Dondia fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species of the genus *Atriplex*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dispersal by wind. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
