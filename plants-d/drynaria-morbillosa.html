<p>Drynaria morbillosa, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, thick rhizomes that help it thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Drynaria morbillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal remedies.</p>
