<p>Duma horrida subsp.</p>
<p>abdita, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
