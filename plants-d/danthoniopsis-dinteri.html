                    <h1>Danthoniopsis dinteri</h1>
<p>Danthoniopsis dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
