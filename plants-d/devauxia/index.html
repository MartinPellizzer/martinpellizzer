                            <h1>Devauxia</h1>
<p>Devauxia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It comprises around 50 species, primarily found in temperate and subtropical regions of the northern hemisphere. These plants are known for their distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions. Devauxia plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
