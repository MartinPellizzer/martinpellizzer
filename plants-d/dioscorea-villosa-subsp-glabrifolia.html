                    <h1>Dioscorea villosa subsp. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Dioscorea villosa subsp.</p>
<p>glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf yam, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate along the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. These tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in various Native American cultures.</p>
<p>The subspecies differs from the more common D. villosa by its smoother stems and smaller, less hairy leaves.</p>
