<p>Deschampsia obensis, commonly known as narrowleaf tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically forms dense tufts or tussocks, which help it thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or rocky. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Deschampsia obensis is often found in meadows, open woodlands, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
