<p>Doodia caudata var. moorei, commonly known as the Moore's bottlebrush fern, is a variant of the bottlebrush fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bottlebrush-like clusters of spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of its fertile fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
