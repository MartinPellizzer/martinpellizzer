                    <h1>Dumasia truncata</h1>
<p>Dumasia truncata, commonly known as the dwarf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense, colorful ground cover.</p>
