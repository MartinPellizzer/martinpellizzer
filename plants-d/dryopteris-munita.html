                    <h1>Dryopteris munita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris munita, commonly known as the Alpine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and short, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
