<p>It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.

<p>Drymaria coahuilana is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>
