<p>Diplotaxis virgata subsp.</p>
<p>virgata, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to white.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to thrive in harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
