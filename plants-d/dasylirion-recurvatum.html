<p>Dasylirion recurvatum, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical, gray-green leaves that are narrow and recurved, giving it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences.
