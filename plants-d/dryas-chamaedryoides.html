                    <h1>Dryas chamaedryoides</h1>
<p>Dryas chamaedryoides, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Dryas chamaedryoides is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in rocky soils and high elevations.</p>
