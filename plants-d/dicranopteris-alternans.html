<p>Dicranopteris alternans, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into smaller, overlapping segments that help in buoyancy and photosynthesis.</p>
