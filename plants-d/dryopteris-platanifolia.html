<p>Dryopteris platanifolia, commonly known as the London sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, leathery, deeply pinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-colored, with the upper surface being dark green and the lower surface lighter, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
