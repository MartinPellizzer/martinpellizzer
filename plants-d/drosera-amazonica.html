                    <h1>Drosera amazonica</h1>
<p>Drosera amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Drosera amazonica is a resilient species adapted to the humid and competitive conditions of the Amazonian ecosystem.</p>
