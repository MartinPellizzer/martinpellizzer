                    <h1>Draba aizoides var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Draba aizoides var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features a basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Its succulent leaves and flowering period make it well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps protect it from desiccation.</p>
