<p>Darwinia salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to saline and arid environments, making it highly tolerant of salt and drought. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Darwinia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
