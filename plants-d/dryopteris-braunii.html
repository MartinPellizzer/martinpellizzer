                    <h1>Dryopteris braunii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris braunii, commonly known as the Braun's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct central vein and small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris braunii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
