<p>Dendrobium azureum, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are striking, with a deep blue hue and a delicate, fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Dendrobium azureum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>
