<p>Disporum pullum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower disporum, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>The small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered at the base of the plant, making it a subtle yet attractive addition to woodland gardens.</p>
