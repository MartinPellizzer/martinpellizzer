<p>Danthonia patula var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth danthonia, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
