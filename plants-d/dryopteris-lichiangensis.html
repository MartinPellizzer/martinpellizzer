                    <h1>Dryopteris lichiangensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
