                    <h1>Didyplosandra lurida var. bourneae</h1>
<p>Didyplosandra lurida var. bourneae, commonly known as the Bourne's ghost tree, is a rare and unique species native to the humid forests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, waxy, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the axils of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation priority due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
