                    <h1>Draconia daghestanica</h1>
<p>Draconia daghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian dragon tree, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, lantern-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
