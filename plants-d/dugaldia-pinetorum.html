                    <h1>Dugaldia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Dugaldia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the bark of pine trees, forming dense, crust-like patches that contribute to the forest floor's biodiversity. The lichen's thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the environment. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
