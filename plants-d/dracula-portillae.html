                    <h1>Dracula portillae</h1>
<p>Dracula portillae, commonly known as the Portillae's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble the wings of a bat, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically deep red or purple, adding to its exotic appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Dracula portillae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
