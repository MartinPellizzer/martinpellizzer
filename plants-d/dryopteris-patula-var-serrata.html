                    <h1>Dryopteris patula var. serrata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris patula var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and turn a golden hue in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
