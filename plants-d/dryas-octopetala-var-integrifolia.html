                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in dense, white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually entire, without toothed edges, and are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
