<p>Dictyocaryum fuscum, commonly known as the black moss or black sheet moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a mat-forming, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant's leaves are small, closely packed, and have a dark green to blackish coloration, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Dictyocaryum fuscum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
