                    <h1>Dendrobium terrestre</h1>
<p>Dendrobium terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) characterized by its ability to grow on the ground rather than on trees.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, adapting to its terrestrial lifestyle.</p>
<p>Dendrobium terrestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions.</p>
