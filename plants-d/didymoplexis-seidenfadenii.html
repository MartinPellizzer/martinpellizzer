                    <h1>Didymoplexis seidenfadenii</h1>
<p>Didymoplexis seidenfadenii, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
