<p>Diateinacanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a marine plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves that help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant's structure is adapted to withstand strong wave action and salt spray. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Diateinacanthus is often found in shallow waters, where it contributes to the biodiversity of intertidal zones.</p>
