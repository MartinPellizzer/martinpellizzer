                    <h1>Dryopteris juglandifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris juglandifolia, commonly known as the walnut-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a walnut, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique characteristic makes it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
