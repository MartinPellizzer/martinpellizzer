<p>Dryopteris pachyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, broad, and deeply divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout much of the year.</p>
