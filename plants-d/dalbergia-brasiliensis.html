<p>Dalbergia brasiliensis, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes.
