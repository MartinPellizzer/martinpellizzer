                    <h1>Descurainia antarctica var. patagonica</h1>
<p>Descurainia antarctica var. patagonica, commonly known as Patagonian wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
