                    <h1>Dianella nigra</h1>
<p>Dianella nigra, commonly known as black flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form thick mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Dianella nigra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and swampy areas.</p>
