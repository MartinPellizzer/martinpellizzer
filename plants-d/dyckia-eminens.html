<p>Dyckia eminens, commonly known as the tall dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like rosette of narrow, evergreen leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces tall inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
