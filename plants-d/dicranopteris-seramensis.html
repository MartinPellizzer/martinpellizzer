                    <h1>Dicranopteris seramensis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in nutrient absorption from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
