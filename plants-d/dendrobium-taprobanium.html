                    <h1>Dendrobium taprobanium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium taprobanium, commonly known as the Ceylon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, allowing it to thrive in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium taprobanium is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in Sri Lanka.</p>
