                    <h1>Dryopteris patens var. macroura</h1>
<p>Dryopteris patens var. macroura, commonly known as the long-veined wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, long veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling over the growing season.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
