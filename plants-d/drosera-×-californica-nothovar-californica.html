                    <h1>Drosera × californica nothovar. californica</h1>
<p>Drosera × californica nothovar. californica, commonly known as the California sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or rocky areas. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
