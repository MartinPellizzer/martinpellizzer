<p>Digitaria fujianensis, commonly known as Fujian digitaria, is a grass species native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
