                    <h1>Dinosperma</h1>
<p>Dinosperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Dinosperma is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
