                    <h1>Dryopteris sancta var. terminalis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sancta var. terminalis, commonly known as the terminal fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
