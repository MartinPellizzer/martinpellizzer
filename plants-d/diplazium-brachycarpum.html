<p>Diplazium brachycarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium brachycarpum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
