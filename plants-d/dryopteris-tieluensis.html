<p>Dryopteris tieluensis, commonly known as the Tielu fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
