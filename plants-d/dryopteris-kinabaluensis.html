                    <h1>Dryopteris kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a species of shield fern native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, specifically Mount Kinabalu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
