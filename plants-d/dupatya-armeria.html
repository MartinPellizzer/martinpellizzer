<p>Dupatya armeria, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Dupatya armeria is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping.</p>
