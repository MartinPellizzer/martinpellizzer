                    <h1>Dendroleandria leandrii</h1>
<p>Dendroleandria leandrii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Dendroleandria leandrii is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
