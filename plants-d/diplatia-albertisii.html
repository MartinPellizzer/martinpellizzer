                    <h1>Diplatia albertisii</h1>
<p>Diplatia albertisii, commonly known as the Albert's flat lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic function necessary for nutrient production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
