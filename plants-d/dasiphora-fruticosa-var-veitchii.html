                    <h1>Dasiphora fruticosa var. veitchii</h1>
<p>Dasiphora fruticosa var. veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's fireweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
