                    <h1>Dasystephana newberryi</h1>
<p>Dasystephana newberryi, commonly known as the Newberry's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that invade the host's vascular system. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
