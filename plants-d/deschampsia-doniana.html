                    <h1>Deschampsia doniana</h1>
<p>Deschampsia doniana, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns golden in autumn. The plant produces delicate, feathery seed heads that are wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates.</p>
<p>Deschampsia doniana plays a vital role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting alpine ecosystems.</p>
