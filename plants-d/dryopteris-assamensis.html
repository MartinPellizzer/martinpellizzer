                    <h1>Dryopteris assamensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris assamensis, commonly known as the Assam wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
