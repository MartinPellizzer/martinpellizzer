<p>Dortmanna pusilla, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Dortmanna pusilla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
