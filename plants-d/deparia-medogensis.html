                    <h1>Deparia medogensis</h1>
<p>Deparia medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Deparia medogensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
