<p>Dictyoloma peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Andean regions.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature means it draws water and nutrients from its host, affecting the host's growth and health.</p>
