                    <h1>Doryopteris trifoliata</h1>
<p>Doryopteris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds, which are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to humid, tropical gardens.</p>
