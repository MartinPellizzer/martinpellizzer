                    <h1>Dipterocarpus angustialatus</h1>
<p>Dipterocarpus angustialatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, particularly in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard timber, it is also valued for commercial purposes, though it faces threats from deforestation.</p>
