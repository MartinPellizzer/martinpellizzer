                    <h1>Dryopteris hirsutifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hirsutifrons, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
