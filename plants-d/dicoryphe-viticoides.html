                    <h1>Dicoryphe viticoides</h1>
<p>Dicoryphe viticoides, commonly known as the grape-like dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 (wrap around) its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is found in various parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and other vegetation.</p>
