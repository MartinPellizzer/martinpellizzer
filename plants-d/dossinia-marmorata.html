                    <h1>Dossinia marmorata</h1>
<p>Dossinia marmorata, commonly known as the marble lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, intricately patterned appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is leathery and features a complex, marbled pattern of white, yellow, and green pigments. It is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
