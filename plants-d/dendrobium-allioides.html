<p>Dendrobium allioides, commonly known as the garlic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf and bears small, white to pale green flowers with a distinctive garlic-like scent. Its unique aroma is a key characteristic that sets it apart from other orchid species.</p>
<p>Dendrobium allioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
