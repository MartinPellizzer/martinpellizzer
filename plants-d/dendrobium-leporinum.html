                    <h1>Dendrobium leporinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium leporinum, commonly known as the rabbit orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium leporinum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
