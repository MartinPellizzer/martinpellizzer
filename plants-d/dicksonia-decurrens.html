<p>Dicksonia decurrens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper portion being dark green and the lower part silvery-white, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional MƒÅori practices.</p>
