                    <h1>Dentaria alaunica</h1>
<p>Dentaria alaunica, commonly known as the alpine toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
