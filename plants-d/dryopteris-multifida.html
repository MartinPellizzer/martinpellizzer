                    <h1>Dryopteris multifida</h1>
<p>Dryopteris multifida, commonly known as the palm fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a palm, with a deeply divided, pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens.</p>
