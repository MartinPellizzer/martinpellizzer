                    <h1>Dryopteris commixta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris commixta, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into two types: sterile, which are usually shorter and less developed, and fertile, which bear spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
