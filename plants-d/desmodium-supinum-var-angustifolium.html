                    <h1>Desmodium supinum var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Desmodium supinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf desmodium, is a low-growing legume native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and is often found in grassy areas or disturbed soils. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This species is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
