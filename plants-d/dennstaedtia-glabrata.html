                <h1>Dennstaedtia glabrata</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in rich, humusy soil.</p>
<p>The smooth fern is a hardy plant that plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
