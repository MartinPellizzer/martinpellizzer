<p>Didymoglossum ekmanii, commonly known as the Arctic feather moss, is a small, perennial moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like shoots and small, densely packed leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and is often found in cold, moist environments such as tundra and alpine regions. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a slow growth rate and a specialized reproductive system that ensures survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum ekmanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats.</p>
