                    <h1>Dryopteris oyamensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oyamensis, commonly known as the Oyama shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
