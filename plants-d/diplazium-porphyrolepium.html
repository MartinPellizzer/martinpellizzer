<p>Diplazium porphyrolepium, commonly known as the purple-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a purple hue, especially on the underside. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, oval-shaped spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Diplazium porphyrolepium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
