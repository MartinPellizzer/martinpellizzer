                    <h1>Dendrophthoe elegans</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe elegans, commonly known as the elegant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Eucalyptus genus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds and other animals. It is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
