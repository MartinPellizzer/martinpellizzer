<p>Deparia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
