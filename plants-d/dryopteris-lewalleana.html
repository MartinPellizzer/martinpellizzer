<p>Dryopteris lewalleana, commonly known as the Lewallean wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
