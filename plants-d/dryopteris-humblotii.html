                    <h1>Dryopteris humblotii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and densely veined. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
