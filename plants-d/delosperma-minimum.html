<p>Delosperma minimum, commonly known as the ice plant or dwarf ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Delosperma minimum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
