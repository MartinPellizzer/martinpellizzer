                    <h1>Dendrophthoe fusca</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe fusca, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its hemiparasitic nature allows it to extract water and some minerals from the host while still having some photosynthetic capability.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe fusca plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
