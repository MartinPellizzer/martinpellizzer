                    <h1>Dracaena laurentii var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Dracaena laurentii var. linearifolia, commonly known as the "Janet Craig" or "Rothschild's Dracaena," is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, elongated, strap-like leaves that are slightly curled and have a waxy texture. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though these are rarely seen in cultivation.</p>
<p>The varietal form linearifolia distinguishes it by its narrow, linear leaves compared to the broader foliage of other Dracaena species.</p>
