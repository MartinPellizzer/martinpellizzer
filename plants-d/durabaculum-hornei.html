                    <h1>Durabaculum hornei</h1>
<p>Durabaculum hornei, commonly known as the Horned Durabaculum, is a unique succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Durabaculum hornei is prized for its resilience and striking appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
