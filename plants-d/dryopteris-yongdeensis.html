<p>Dryopteris yongdeensis, commonly known as the Yongde water fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
