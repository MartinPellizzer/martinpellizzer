<p>Doellingeria elegans, commonly known as the elegant water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with the petioles submerged in the water column. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Doellingeria elegans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
