                    <h1>Dryopteris nephrodioides var. biolleyi</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nephrodioides var. biolleyi, commonly known as the Biolley's water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
