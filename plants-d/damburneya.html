<p>Damburneya, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plants typically grow to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, upright stems that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Damburneya species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, followed by small, three-lobed seed heads.</p>
