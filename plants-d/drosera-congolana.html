                    <h1>Drosera congolana</h1>
<p>Drosera congolana, commonly known as the Congo sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with red or pink hues, and they curl around captured prey to aid in digestion. Drosera congolana thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas.</p>
<p>It is a relatively rare species, often found in the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
