<p>Diplazium oshimense, commonly known as Oshim's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces two types of leaves: sterile fronds and spore-bearing sporophylls. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the sporophylls, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Diplazium oshimense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
