                    <h1>Dalbergia riedelii</h1>
<p>Dalbergia riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique wood characteristics and its role in traditional craftsmanship, although it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
