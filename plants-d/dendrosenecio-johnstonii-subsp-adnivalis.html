<p>Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp.</p>
<p>adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
