<p>Draba incana subsp.</p>
<p>confusa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It has basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
