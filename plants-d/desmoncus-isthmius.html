<p>Desmoncus isthmius, commonly known as the Isthmus liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and slightly succulent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on damp soil. It has a low-growing habit and lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body.</p>
<p>Desmoncus isthmius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
