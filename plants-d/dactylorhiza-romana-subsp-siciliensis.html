<p>Dactylorhiza romana subsp.</p>
<p>siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a short rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, elliptical pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing several lanceolate leaves and a raceme of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several European countries.</p>
