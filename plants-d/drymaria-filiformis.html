                    <h1>Drymaria filiformis</h1>
<p>Drymaria filiformis, commonly known as slender sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its stems are thin and trailing, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria filiformis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
