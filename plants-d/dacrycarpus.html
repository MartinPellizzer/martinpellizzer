                    <h1>Dacrycarpus</h1>
<p>Dacrycarpus, commonly known as the silver pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of conifers. Dacrycarpus species typically grow in moist, temperate to subtropical climates, often in forested areas. They have a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, contributing to the ecological stability of their habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, which is widely distributed across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
