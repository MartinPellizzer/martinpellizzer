                    <h1>Dendrobium lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branched stem covered in soft, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lanuginosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
