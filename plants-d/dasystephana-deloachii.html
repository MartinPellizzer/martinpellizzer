                    <h1>Dasystephana deloachii</h1>
<p>Dasystephana deloachii, commonly known as the Deloach's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis through its green stems. It is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
