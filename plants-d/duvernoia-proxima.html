                    <h1>Duvernoia proxima</h1>
<p>Duvernoia proxima, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a unique plant native to southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered.</p>
