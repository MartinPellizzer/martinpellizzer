<p>Danthonia cumminsii, commonly known as the Cummins' grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Danthonia cumminsii is often found in coastal regions and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
