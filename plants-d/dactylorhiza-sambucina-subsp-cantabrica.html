<p>Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp.</p>
<p>cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in wetland and marsh habitats, often found in areas with calcareous soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. It is closely related to other members of the Dactylorhiza genus, which are known for their complex pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
