<p>Discocactus heptacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>catingicola, commonly known as the Catinga discocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
