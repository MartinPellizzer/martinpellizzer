<p>Dendrosenecio kilimanjari subsp.</p>
<p>kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro tree heath, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the arid conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and its role in the local ecosystem.</p>
