                    <h1>Draba oxycarpa var. capsularis</h1>
<p>Draba oxycarpa var. capsularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of wiry, hairy stems and small, basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by capsule fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ability to colonize harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
