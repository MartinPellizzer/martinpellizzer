                    <h1>Diplazium merrillii</h1>
<p>Diplazium merrillii, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Diplazium merrillii plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
