                    <h1>Dryopteris × slossoniae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × slossoniae, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris hirta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, featuring a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
