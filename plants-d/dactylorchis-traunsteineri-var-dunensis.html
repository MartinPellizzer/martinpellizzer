<p>Dactylorchis traunsteineri var. dunensis, commonly known as the Dunensis Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their subdued coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or along rocky stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
