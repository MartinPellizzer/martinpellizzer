                    <h1>Duggena pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Duggena pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered dust plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
