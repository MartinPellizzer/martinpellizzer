                    <h1>Disterigma noyesiae</h1>
<p>Disterigma noyesiae, commonly known as the Noyes' disterigma, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a very limited geographic region in South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and delicate, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or humid lowland areas. Its conservation status is of significant concern due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Disterigma noyesiae plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
