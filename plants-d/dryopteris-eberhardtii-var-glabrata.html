                    <h1>Dryopteris eberhardtii var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris eberhardtii var. glabrata, commonly known as the Eberhardt's shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
