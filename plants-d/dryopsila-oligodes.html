<p>Dryopsila oligodes, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has delicate, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures are concealed within small, spore-bearing capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
