                    <h1>Daucus gibbosus</h1>
<p>Daucus gibbosus, commonly known as the mountain carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble carrots, which are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other Daucus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild.</p>
