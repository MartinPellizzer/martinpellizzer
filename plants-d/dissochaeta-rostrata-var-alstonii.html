<p>Dissochaeta rostrata var. alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's spiny beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bristly inflorescence and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
