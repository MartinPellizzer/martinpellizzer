                    <h1>Deuterocohnia digitata</h1>
<p>Deuterocohnia digitata, commonly known as the pink cushion plant, is a succulent native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically pink to reddish in color, especially when exposed to full sun, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures.</p>
<p>This plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to form compact, decorative clumps.</p>
