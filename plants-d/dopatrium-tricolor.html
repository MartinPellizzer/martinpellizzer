                    <h1>Dopatrium tricolor</h1>
<p>Dopatrium tricolor, commonly known as the three-color bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive three-lobed, bladder-like fruits that turn red as they mature. Dopatrium tricolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique fruit morphology and seasonal color changes make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
