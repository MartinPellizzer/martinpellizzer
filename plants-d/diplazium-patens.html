                    <h1>Diplazium patens</h1>
<p>Diplazium patens, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that spread horizontally along the ground. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous pinnae, often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
