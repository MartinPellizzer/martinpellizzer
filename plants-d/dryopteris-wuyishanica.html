                    <h1>Dryopteris wuyishanica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris wuyishanica, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountains shield fern, is a species of fern native to China, specifically the Wuyi Mountains region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
