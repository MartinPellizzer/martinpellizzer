                    <h1>Dysosmia acerifolia</h1>
<p>Dysosmia acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved dysosma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are deeply lobed and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dysosmia acerifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
