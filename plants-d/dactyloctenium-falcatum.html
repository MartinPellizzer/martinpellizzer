                    <h1>Dactyloctenium falcatum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium falcatum, commonly known as the flatleaf grass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a weed and a potential forage crop.</p>
<p>Dactyloctenium falcatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in certain environments.</p>
