<p>Dendrobium gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferum orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gemmiferum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
