                    <h1>Dryopteris spinulosa var. dumetorum</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spinulosa var. dumetorum, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique frond structure and growth habits.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lanceolate fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and the absence of true leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
