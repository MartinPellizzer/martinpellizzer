                    <h1>Digomphia</h1>
<p>Digomphia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to glow in low light conditions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the summer months, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are adapted to conserve water, featuring a waxy coating and reduced surface area.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Digomphia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
