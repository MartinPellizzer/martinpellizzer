                    <h1>Donax bengalensis</h1>
<p>Donax bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a vital role in coastal ecosystem stability. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Donax bengalensis is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and support biodiversity in mangrove habitats.</p>
