                    <h1>Drosera ferruginea</h1>
<p>Drosera ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to immobilize prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>The rusty sundew is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured insects, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
