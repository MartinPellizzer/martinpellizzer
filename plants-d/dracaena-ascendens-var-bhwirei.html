<p>Dracaena ascendens var. bhwirei, commonly known as the Black Dragon Plant, is a cultivar of the dracaena genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that often have a subtle reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though fruiting is rare in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its upright growth habit makes it an excellent choice for indoor spaces or as a statement plant in gardens.</p>
