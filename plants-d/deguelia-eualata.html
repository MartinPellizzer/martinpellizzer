<p>Deguelia eualata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
