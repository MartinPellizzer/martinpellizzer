                    <h1>Dendrobium × intermedium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × intermedium, commonly known as the cross-armed orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × intermedium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
