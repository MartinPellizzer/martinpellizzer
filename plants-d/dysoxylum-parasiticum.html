                    <h1>Dysoxylum parasiticum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic dysoxylum, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and broad, ovate leaves. The plant lacks chlorophyll in its parasitic parts, relying on its host for water and minerals. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, aiding in the plant's dispersal.</p>
