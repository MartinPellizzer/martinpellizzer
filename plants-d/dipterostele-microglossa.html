                    <h1>Dipterostele microglossa</h1>
<p>Dipterostele microglossa, commonly known as the small-lipped dipterostele, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a complex arrangement of vascular tissue. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are positioned along the margins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Its name derives from the structure of its stem, which contains a distinctive dipterostele, a type of vascular system with two central cylinders.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
