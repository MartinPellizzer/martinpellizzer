<p>Deparia truncata, commonly known as the rounded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged vegetation or rocks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often curled at the tips. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Deparia truncata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
