                    <h1>Dorema</h1>
<p>Dorema, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have hairy, glandular leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Dorema species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
