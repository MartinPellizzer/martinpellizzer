<p>Dendrobium dubium, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrobium dubium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
