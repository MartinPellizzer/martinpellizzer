                    <h1>Decaspermum exiguum</h1>
<p>Decaspermum exiguum, commonly known as the small spore grass, is a small annual herb belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its low stature and specialized adaptations, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats.</p>
