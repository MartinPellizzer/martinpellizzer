                    <h1>Dryopteris gemmulifera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gemmulifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores in compact, club-like structures called gemmae, which are borne on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
