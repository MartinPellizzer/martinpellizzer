                    <h1>Dipteropeltis mayumbensis</h1>
<p>Dipteropeltis mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb√© fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in the canopy of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
