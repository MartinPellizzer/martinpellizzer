                    <h1>Diplostephium rangelii</h1>
<p>Diplostephium rangelii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to xerophytic conditions, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
