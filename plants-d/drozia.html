<p>Drozia, commonly known as the drosera, is a genus of carnivorous plants belonging to the family Droseraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. Drozia species are typically found in nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. They are popular among plant enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and fascinating trapping mechanism.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 150 species, many of which are native to Australia and South Africa.</p>
