<p>Dendrobium lubbersianum, commonly known as the LÃ¼bersian orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lubbersianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
