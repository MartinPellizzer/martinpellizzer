                    <h1>Dracontia conochila</h1>
<p>Dracontia conochila, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble the shape of a dragon's tongue, giving it its common name. The plant has a complex, branched rhizome system that helps it anchor in rocky or acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracontia conochila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
