<p>Dendrotrophe heterantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrotrophe heterantha thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas where suitable host trees are present.</p>
