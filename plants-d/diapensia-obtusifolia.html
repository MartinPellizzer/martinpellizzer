                    <h1>Diapensia obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Diapensia obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Diapensia obtusifolia is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
