<p>Discocactus zehntneri subsp.</p>
<p>zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are covered in a thick layer of wax, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
