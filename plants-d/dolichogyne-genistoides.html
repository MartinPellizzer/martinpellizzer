                    <h1>Dolichogyne genistoides</h1>
<p>Dolichogyne genistoides, commonly known as the creeping goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
