                    <h1>Dryopteris pleiotoma</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pleiotoma, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base of the leaf. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The broad shield fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
