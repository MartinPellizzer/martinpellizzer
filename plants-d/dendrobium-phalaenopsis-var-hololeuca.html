<p>Dendrobium phalaenopsis var. hololeuca, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
