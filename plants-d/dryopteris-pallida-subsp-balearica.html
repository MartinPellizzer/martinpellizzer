<p>Dryopteris pallida subsp.</p>
<p>balearica, commonly known as the Balearic lady fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
