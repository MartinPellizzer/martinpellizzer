<p>Diplocaulobium connexicostatum, commonly known as the lace-leaf fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
