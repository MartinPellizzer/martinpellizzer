<p>Doronicum orphanidis, commonly known as the alpine leopard's-bane, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Doronicum orphanidis is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
