                    <h1>Dryopteris multilineata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris multilineata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
