                    <h1>Dendrobium cancroides</h1>
<p>Dendrobium cancroides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cancroides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
