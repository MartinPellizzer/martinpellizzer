                    <h1>Dryopteris pavoniana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pavoniana, commonly known as the peacock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the tail of a peacock, with a central, glossy, dark green band and lighter, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
