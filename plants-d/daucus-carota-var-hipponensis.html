                    <h1>Daucus carota var. hipponensis</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. hipponensis, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a wild variant of the carrot plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, usually purple-tinged stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils. Its roots are generally smaller and less developed compared to the domesticated carrot, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its historical and genetic significance.</p>
