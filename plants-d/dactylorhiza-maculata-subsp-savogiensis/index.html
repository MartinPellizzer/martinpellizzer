                            <h1>Dactylorhiza Maculata Subsp. Savogiensis</h1>
<p>Savoy orchid, scientifically known as Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. savogiensis, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This subspecies is distinguished by its uniquely colored leaves and delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes, often in areas with partial shade. Despite its beauty, the Savoy orchid faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its presence in the wild is a testament to the biodiversity of alpine and temperate ecosystems.</p>
