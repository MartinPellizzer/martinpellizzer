                    <h1>Dalbergia assamica</h1>
<p>Dalbergia assamica, commonly known as Assam rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
