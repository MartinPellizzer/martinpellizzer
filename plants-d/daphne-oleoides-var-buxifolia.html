<p>Daphne oleoides var. buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
