                    <h1>Diplachne parviflora</h1>
<p>Diplachne parviflora, commonly known as slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, grasslands, and along waterways. Diplachne parviflora has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain environments.</p>
