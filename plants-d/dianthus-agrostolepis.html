                    <h1>Dianthus agrostolepis</h1>
<p>Dianthus agrostolepis, commonly known as the sand dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Dianthus agrostolepis is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
