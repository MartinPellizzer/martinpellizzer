                    <h1>Diastemation</h1>
<p>Diastemation, commonly known as the process of widening or separating plant structures, is a botanical phenomenon observed in certain species during growth or development.</p>
<p>It typically involves the expansion of cell walls or the separation of tissues, which can occur in stems, roots, or other plant parts. This process is often associated with the elongation of cells, leading to increased plant height or structural modification. Diastemation plays a role in various physiological processes, including water transport and mechanical support.</p>
<p>It is a key aspect of plant morphology and can influence the overall form and function of the organism.</p>
