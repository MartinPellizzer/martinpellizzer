                    <h1>Ditassa oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Ditassa oxyphylla, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
