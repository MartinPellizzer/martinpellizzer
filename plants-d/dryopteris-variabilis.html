                    <h1>Dryopteris variabilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris variabilis, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name.</p>
