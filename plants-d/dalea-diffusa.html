                    <h1>Dalea diffusa</h1>
<p>Dalea diffusa, commonly known as the western prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dalea diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant growth.</p>
