The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children.</p>
