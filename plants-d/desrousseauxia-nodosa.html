                    <h1>Desrousseauxia nodosa</h1>
<p>Desrousseauxia nodosa, commonly known as the nodular lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate, branched thallus structure.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. The plant is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Its slow growth rate and distinct nodular morphology make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also used in air quality monitoring.</p>
