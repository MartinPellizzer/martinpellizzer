                            <h1>Dianthera Acuminatissima</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Dianthera acuminatissima, is a striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is renowned for its large, showy yellow blooms that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-resistant gardens. Its unique blooming pattern and ecological importance attract a variety of pollinators, including moths and bats. Despite its delicate appearance, the evening primrose is remarkably resilient, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with ease.</p>
