                    <h1>Dendrobium funiforme</h1>
<p>Dendrobium funiforme, commonly known as the orchid with a funnelform lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored and shaped like a funnel.</p>
<p>Dendrobium funiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
