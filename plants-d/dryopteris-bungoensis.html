<p>Dryopteris bungoensis, commonly known as the Bungo fern, is a species of shield fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris bungoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
