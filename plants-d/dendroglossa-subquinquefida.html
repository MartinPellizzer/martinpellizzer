                    <h1>Dendroglossa subquinquefida</h1>
<p>Dendroglossa subquinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed tree toad, is a species of tree frog native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed vocal sac, which is prominent in males during mating calls. The plant-like name may be a misnomer, as it refers to the frog rather than a botanical species. This frog typically inhabits humid forest environments, where it can be found perched on leaves or in the canopy.</p>
<p>Its botanical features are not applicable, as it is an amphibian, not a plant.</p>
