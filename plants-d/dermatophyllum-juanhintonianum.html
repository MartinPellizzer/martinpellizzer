                    <h1>Dermatophyllum juanhintonianum</h1>
<p>Dermatophyllum juanhintonianum, commonly known as the Juan Hinton's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with thick, waxy leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold and high UV radiation. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming only during specific meteorological conditions, such as after heavy rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most elusive and poorly understood botanical species in the world.</p>
