                    <h1>Drynaria serpens</h1>
<p>Drynaria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of luciferin.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular plant in horticulture.</p>
