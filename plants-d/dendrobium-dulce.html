<p>Dendrobium dulce, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous thin, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with a subtle sweet scent. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Dendrobium dulce thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
