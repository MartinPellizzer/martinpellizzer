<p>Didissandra elongata subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf didissandra, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the humid forests of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understory layers of evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
