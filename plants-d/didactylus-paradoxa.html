The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow and green.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unusual appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
