                    <h1>Desmodium procumbens</h1>
<p>Desmodium procumbens, commonly known as creeping desmodium, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Desmodium procumbens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
