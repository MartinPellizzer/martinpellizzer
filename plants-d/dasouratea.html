                    <h1>Dasouratea</h1>
<p>Dasouratea, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling spectral forms against the green foliage. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and water, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Dasouratea is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
