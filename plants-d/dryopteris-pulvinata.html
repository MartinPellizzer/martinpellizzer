<p>Dryopteris pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The pulvinate wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
