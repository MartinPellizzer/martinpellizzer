                    <h1>Darlingtonia rediviva</h1>
<p>Darlingtonia rediviva, commonly known as the red ivy or the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sarraceniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in moist, acidic, and nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and rocky stream banks. Its unique morphology includes a hooded structure that directs rainwater into the pitcher, aiding in the trapping of prey.</p>
<p>Darlingtonia rediviva is also notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance in its habitat.</p>
