                    <h1>Dalea plumosa</h1>
<p>Dalea plumosa, commonly known as the plume dalea, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with narrow, gray-green leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Dalea plumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
