<p>Diodella mello-barretoi, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
