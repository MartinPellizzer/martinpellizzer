                    <h1>Dryopteris moussetii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris moussetii, commonly known as the Mousset's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, bipinnate leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
