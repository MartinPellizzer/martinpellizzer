<p>Dendrobium sylvanum, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sylvanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral characteristics.</p>
