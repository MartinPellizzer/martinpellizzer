                    <h1>Dendrophorbium restingae</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium restingae, commonly known as the Restinga tree, is a unique species native to the coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize the sandy soils of the Restinga ecosystem. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small,革质 (leathery) leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Dendrophorbium restingae plays a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity of the Restinga biome.</p>
