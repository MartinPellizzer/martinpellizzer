<p>Diplazium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit and feather-like fronds that are typically divided into smaller pinnae. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
