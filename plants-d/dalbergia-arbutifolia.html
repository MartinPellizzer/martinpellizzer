<p>Dalbergia arbutifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species.</p>
