                    <h1>Disphyma</h1>
<p>Disphyma, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and compact growth form. Disphyma species often have a low-growing habit, with fleshy stems that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences that are either racemose or cymose.</p>
<p>Disphyma plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
