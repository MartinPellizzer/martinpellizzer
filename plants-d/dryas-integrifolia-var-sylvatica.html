                    <h1>Dryas integrifolia var. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Dryas integrifolia var. sylvatica, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
