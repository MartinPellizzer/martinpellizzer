<p>Diplopterygium volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and ethnobotanical research.</p>
