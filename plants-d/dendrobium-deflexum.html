<p>Dendrobium deflexum, commonly known as the flexed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without parasitizing them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive, recurved lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium deflexum prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
