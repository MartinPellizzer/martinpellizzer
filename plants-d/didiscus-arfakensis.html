                    <h1>Didiscus arfakensis</h1>
<p>Didiscus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak diskflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of West Papua.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptive evolution in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Didiscus arfakensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
