                    <h1>Dryopteris caudifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris caudifrons, commonly known as the long-awned wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark brown, scaly stems that produce fronds throughout the growing season. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive elongated, drooping shape that gives the plant its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
