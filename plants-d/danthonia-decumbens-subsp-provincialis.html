<p>Danthonia decumbens subsp.</p>
<p>provincialis, commonly known as the coastal tussock grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
