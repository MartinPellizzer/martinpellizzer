                    <h1>Dryopetalon auriculatum</h1>
<p>Dryopetalon auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a prominent auriculate (ear-like) lobe at the base of the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation.</p>
