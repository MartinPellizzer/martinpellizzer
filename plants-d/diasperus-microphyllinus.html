                    <h1>Diasperus microphyllinus</h1>
<p>Diasperus microphyllinus, commonly known as the small-leaf desert shrub, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
