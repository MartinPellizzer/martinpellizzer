                            <h1>Distictis Elongata</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Distictis elongata, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is celebrated for its vibrant, flame-like clusters of red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree's unique appearance, with its feathery foliage and fiery blooms, makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions further enhances its appeal among horticulturists. Despite its beauty, the coral tree requires careful pruning and attention to thrive in non-native environments.</p>
