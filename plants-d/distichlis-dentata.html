<p>Distichlis dentata, commonly known as the saltbush or saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Distichlis dentata is also used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to tolerate extreme conditions.</p>
