                    <h1>Duvernoia appendiculata</h1>
<p>Duvernoia appendiculata, commonly known as the Guangxi cycad, is a unique cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy sarcocarp, which is an unusual feature among cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
