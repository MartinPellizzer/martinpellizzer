<p>Discaria crenata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal everlasting or sea everlasting, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species for coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
