                    <h1>Dendrobium aureum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium aureum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium aureum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
