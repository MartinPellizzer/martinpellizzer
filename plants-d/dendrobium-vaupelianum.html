<p>Dendrobium vaupelianum, commonly known as the Phuket orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
