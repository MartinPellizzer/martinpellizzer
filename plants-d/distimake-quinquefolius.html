                    <h1>Distimake quinquefolius</h1>
<p>Distimake quinquefolius, commonly known as the five-leafed fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically bear five leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
