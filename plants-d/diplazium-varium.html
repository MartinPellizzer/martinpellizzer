<p>Diplazium varium, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a member of the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, finely divided fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Diplazium varium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
