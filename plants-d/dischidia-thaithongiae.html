                    <h1>Dischidia thaithongiae</h1>
<p>Dischidia thaithongiae, commonly known as the Thai bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bubble-like stems that store water. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by berries that are typically red or orange when mature.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
