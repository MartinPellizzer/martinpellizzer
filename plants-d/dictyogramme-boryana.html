<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
