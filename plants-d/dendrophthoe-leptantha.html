                    <h1>Dendrophthoe leptantha</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe leptantha, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually elliptic in shape, contributing to its overall shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe leptantha is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
