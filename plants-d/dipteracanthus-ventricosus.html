<p>Dipteracanthus ventricosus, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, balloon-like stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
