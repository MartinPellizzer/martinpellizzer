<p>Deyeuxia javana, commonly known as the Java sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice fields, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia javana is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
