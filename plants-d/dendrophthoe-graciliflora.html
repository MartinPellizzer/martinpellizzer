                    <h1>Dendrophthoe graciliflora</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe graciliflora is often found in forest canopies, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat.</p>
