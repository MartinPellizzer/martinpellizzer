<p>Dasiphora subacaulis, commonly known as the creeping fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with numerous slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Dasiphora subacaulis is adapted to rocky and disturbed soils, making it a common sight in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
