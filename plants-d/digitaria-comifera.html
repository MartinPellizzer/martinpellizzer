                    <h1>Digitaria comifera</h1>
<p>Digitaria comifera, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Digitaria comifera is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
