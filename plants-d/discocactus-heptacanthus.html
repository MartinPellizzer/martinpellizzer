<p>Discocactus heptacanthus, commonly known as the seven-spined discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its spines are short and often arranged in a distinctive seven-armed pattern, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
