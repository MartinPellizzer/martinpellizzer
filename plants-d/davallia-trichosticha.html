                    <h1>Davallia trichosticha</h1>
<p>Davallia trichosticha, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
