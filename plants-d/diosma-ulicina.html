<p>Diosma ulicina, commonly known as the narrowleaf diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, woodlands and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract various pollinators. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Diosma ulicina is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
