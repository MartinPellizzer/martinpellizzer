<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp.</p>
<p>wirtgenii, commonly known as the Wirtgen's marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in peat bogs and moist meadows, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short flowering period, making it difficult to observe.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
