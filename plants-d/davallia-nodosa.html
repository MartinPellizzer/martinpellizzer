                    <h1>Davallia nodosa</h1>
<p>Davallia nodosa, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with curled, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, making it a popular ornamental plant in humid climates.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
