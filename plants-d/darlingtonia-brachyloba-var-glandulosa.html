                    <h1>Darlingtonia brachyloba var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Darlingtonia brachyloba var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a reddish or purple hue, and they emit a sweet scent to attract prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating and downward-pointing hairs that prevent trapped insects from escaping.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its glandular structures that secrete digestive enzymes, aiding in the breakdown of captured prey.</p>
