<p>Dryopteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
