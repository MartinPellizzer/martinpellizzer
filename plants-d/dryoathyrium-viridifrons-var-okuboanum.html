                    <h1>Dryoathyrium viridifrons var. okuboanum</h1>
<p>Dryoathyrium viridifrons var. okuboanum, commonly known as the Okubo's green-fronted fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky, greenish hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
