                    <h1>Danthonia breviseta</h1>
<p>Danthonia breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
