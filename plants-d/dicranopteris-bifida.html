<p>Dicranopteris bifida, commonly known as the bifid water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into two parts, giving it the name "bifida.". The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris bifida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
