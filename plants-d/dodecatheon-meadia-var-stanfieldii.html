                    <h1>Dodecatheon meadia var. stanfieldii</h1>
<p>Dodecatheon meadia var. stanfieldii, commonly known as the Stanfield's globemallow, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the central United States, particularly found in Oklahoma and Texas, where it thrives in open prairies and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
