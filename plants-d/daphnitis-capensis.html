<p>Daphnitis capensis, commonly known as the Cape water lily, is a aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide a surface for the plant to photosynthesize. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Daphnitis capensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
