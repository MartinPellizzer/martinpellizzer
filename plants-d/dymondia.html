<p>Dymondia, commonly known as silver grass or dymondia succulent, is a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plants feature narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance.
