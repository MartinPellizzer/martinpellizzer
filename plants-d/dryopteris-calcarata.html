                    <h1>Dryopteris calcarata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups.</p>
<p>Dryopteris calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
