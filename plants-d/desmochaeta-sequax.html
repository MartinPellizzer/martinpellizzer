<p>Desmochaeta sequax, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Desmochaeta sequax is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
