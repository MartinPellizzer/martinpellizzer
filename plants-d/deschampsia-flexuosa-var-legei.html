<p>Deschampsia flexuosa var. legei, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bend toward the ground, a characteristic that lends it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
