<p>Dryopteris hispida, commonly known as the hispid wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery or hairy appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris hispida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
