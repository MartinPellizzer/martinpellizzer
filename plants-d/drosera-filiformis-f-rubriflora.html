                    <h1>Drosera filiformis f. rubriflora</h1>
<p>Drosera filiformis f. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered slender sundew, is a variant of the slender sundew native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>This carnivorous plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The foliage is typically covered in tiny, glandular hairs that produce the adhesive. The inflorescence consists of a single, erect flower stem bearing a cluster of small, pink to red flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its striking red floral coloration, which distinguishes it from the more common green-flowered form.</p>
