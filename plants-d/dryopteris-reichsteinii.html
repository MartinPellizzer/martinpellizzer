                    <h1>Dryopteris reichsteinii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris reichsteinii, commonly known as the Reichstein's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture.</p>
