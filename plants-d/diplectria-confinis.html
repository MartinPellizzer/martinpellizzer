                    <h1>Diplectria confinis</h1>
<p>Diplectria confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridium, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle.</p>
