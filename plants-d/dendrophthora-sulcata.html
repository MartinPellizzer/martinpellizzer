                    <h1>Dendrophthora sulcata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate tree fungus, is a unique species of fungus that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive sulcate or grooved surface on its fruiting bodies, which are typically found on decaying wood. This fungus plays an important role in the decomposition process within forest ecosystems. Its growth is often associated with specific host trees, such as oaks and maples, in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Dendrophthora sulcata is of interest to mycologists studying fungal ecology and biodiversity.</p>
