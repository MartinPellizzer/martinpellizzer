                    <h1>Diplandra pumila</h1>
<p>Diplandra pumila, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, grey-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diplandra pumila thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
