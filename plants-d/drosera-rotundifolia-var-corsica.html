                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia var. corsica</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican Sundew, is a variant of the common sundew native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, sticky leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths, and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical Drosera rotundifolia.</p>
