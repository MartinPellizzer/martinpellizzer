                    <h1>Dactyloctenium aegyptiacum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian dactyloctenium, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the warmer regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a weed and a potential forage species.</p>
