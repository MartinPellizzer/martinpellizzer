                    <h1>Daemonorops kunstleri var. langkawiensis</h1>
<p>Daemonorops kunstleri var. langkawiensis, commonly known as the Langkawi cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Langkawi in Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
