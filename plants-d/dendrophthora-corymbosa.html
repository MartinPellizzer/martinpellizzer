                    <h1>Dendrophthora corymbosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on its host, potentially affecting the host's health.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora corymbosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
