                    <h1>Duguetia sooretamae</h1>
<p>Duguetia sooretamae, commonly known as the Amazonian star apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to star fruit, though less commonly consumed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species.</p>
