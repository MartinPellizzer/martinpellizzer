<p>Discocactus insignis, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and distinctive yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Discocactus insignis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
