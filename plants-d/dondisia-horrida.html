                    <h1>Dondisia horrida</h1>
<p>Dondisia horrida, commonly known as the horrid dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a rough and spiny appearance. It is native to parts of Africa and is known for its ability to infest a variety of host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
