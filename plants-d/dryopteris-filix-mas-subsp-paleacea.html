<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>paleacea, commonly known as the pale male fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
