                    <h1>Dryopteris fendleri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
