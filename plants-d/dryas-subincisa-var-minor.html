                    <h1>Dryas subincisa var. minor</h1>
<p>Dryas subincisa var. minor, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller size and more compact growth structure.</p>
