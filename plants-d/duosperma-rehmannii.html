<p>Duosperma rehmannii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has succulent, bluish-gray leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Duosperma rehmannii is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
