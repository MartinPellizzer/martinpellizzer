<p>Delphinium tenuisectum subsp.</p>
<p>amplibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bract delphinium, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its broad, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower spikes, giving it a unique appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
