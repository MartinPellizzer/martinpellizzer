                    <h1>Dichanthelium congestum</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium congestum, commonly known as the clustered dichanthelium, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its growth habit is often clump-forming, with dense clusters of stems arising from a central base.</p>
<p>Dichanthelium congestum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
