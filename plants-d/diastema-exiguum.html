                    <h1>Diastema exiguum</h1>
<p>Diastema exiguum, commonly known as the slender gap plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 centimeters, featuring narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area.</p>
<p>Diastema exiguum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
