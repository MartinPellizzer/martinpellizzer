<p>Dactylis glomerata subsp.</p>
<p>oceanica, commonly known as sea couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments.</p>
<p>The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats that stabilize sandy or shingle shores. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
