<p>Dischidia digitiformis, commonly known as the Bird's Nest Vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aerial roots and its ability to attach itself to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dischidia digitiformis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
