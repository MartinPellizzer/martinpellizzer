                    <h1>Dendrobium imitator</h1>
<p>Dendrobium imitator, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are often mistaken for those of other orchid species due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>Dendrobium imitator thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
