                    <h1>Dorstenia laurentii</h1>
<p>Dorstenia laurentii, commonly known as the "Cushion Plant," is a unique member of the Malvaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Dorstenia laurentii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unusual form and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
