<p>Digitaria microbachne subsp.</p>
<p>calliblepharata, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
