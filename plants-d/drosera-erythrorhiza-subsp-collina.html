<p>Drosera erythrorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>collina, commonly known as the pink-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its reddish stems and sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces a unique, pinkish root system.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
