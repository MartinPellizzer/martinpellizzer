                    <h1>Dactylorhiza × senayi</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza × senayi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza lapponica. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs. It produces a tall, erect stem with a dense cluster of pale blue or white flowers.</p>
<p>The roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, a common adaptation in orchids.</p>
