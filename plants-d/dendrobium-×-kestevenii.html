                    <h1>Dendrobium × kestevenii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × kestevenii, commonly known as the Kesteven's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a variety of colors including white, pink, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × kestevenii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
