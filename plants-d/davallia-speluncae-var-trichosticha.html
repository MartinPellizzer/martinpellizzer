                    <h1>Davallia speluncae var. trichosticha</h1>
<p>Davallia speluncae var. trichosticha, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, slender fronds that often form a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in caves or dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The varietal name *trichosticha* refers to its hairy or hairy-like appearance on the fronds, a distinguishing feature from the typical form.</p>
