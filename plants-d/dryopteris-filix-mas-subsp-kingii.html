<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust fronds and a slightly different leaf shape compared to the typical filix-mas.</p>
