                    <h1>Desmodium rigidum</h1>
<p>Desmodium rigidum, commonly known as rigid ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to various regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
