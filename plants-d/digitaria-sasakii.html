                    <h1>Digitaria sasakii</h1>
<p>Digitaria sasakii, commonly known as Japanese barnyardgrass, is a grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is not native.</p>
