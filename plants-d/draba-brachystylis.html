<p>Draba brachystylis, commonly known as the short-stemmed whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves are fully developed. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Draba brachystylis is also noted for its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas.</p>
