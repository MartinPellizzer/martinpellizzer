<p>Common panic grass, scientifically known as Dicliptera verticillata, is a resilient and fast-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion due to its extensive root system. Its tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental and landscaping purposes. Despite its benefits, it can also become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
