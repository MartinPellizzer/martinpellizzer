<p>Dryopteris funckii, commonly known as the Funck's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Dryopteris funckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
