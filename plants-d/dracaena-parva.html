<p>Dracaena parva, commonly known as the little dragon tree, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish or bronze tint along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Dracaena parva is popular as a houseplant due to its resilience and ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
