                    <h1>Draco surculosa</h1>
<p>Draco surculosa, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it bears yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its most notable feature is the production of a red, resinous sap, which has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its slow growth and ability to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
