                    <h1>Dendrophthora lanceifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
