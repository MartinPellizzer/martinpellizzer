                    <h1>Drymoglossum niphoboloides</h1>
<p>Drymoglossum niphoboloides, commonly known as the alpine feather moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces spore capsules that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical structures called sporophytes. It is commonly found in high-altitude regions, such as mountainous areas and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>This moss plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and retaining moisture in harsh environments.</p>
