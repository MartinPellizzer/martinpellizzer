                    <h1>Draba rivetii</h1>
<p>Draba rivetii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a tight cluster at the top of the stem. Draba rivetii thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
