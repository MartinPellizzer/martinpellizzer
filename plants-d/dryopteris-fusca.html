                    <h1>Dryopteris fusca</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fusca, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized shield-like structure called an indusium.</p>
