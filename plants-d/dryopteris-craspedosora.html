                    <h1>Dryopteris craspedosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris craspedosora, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
