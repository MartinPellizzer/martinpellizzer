                    <h1>Dupatya vivipara</h1>
<p>Dupatya vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its viviparous reproduction method, where the sporophytes develop on the mother plant before being released.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually pinnately compound. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, producing spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical forests.</p>
