<p>Dendrobium basilanense, commonly known as the Basilan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium basilanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
