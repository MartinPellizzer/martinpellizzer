                    <h1>Drosera circinervia</h1>
<p>Drosera circinervia, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spiral-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that produce digestive enzymes to break down prey. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject in both botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
