                    <h1>Didymocarpus malayanus f. fasciatus</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus malayanus f. fasciatus, commonly known as the Malayan sandstone fig, is a variant of the sandstone fig tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf patterns, featuring distinct fasciation, which gives the leaves a striped or banded appearance. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive foliage rather than its fruit.</p>
