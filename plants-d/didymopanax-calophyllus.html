<p>Didymopanax calophyllus, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or white sago, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots are used as a starch source, similar to cassava, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
