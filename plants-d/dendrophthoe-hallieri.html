                    <h1>Dendrophthoe hallieri</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe hallieri, commonly known as the Halli's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its aerial roots penetrate the host's bark to establish a connection for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
