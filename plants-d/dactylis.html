                    <h1>Dactylis</h1>
<p>Dactylis, commonly known as goat's rue, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. Dactylis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in forage agriculture due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
