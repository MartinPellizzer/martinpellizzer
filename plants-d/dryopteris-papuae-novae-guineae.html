                    <h1>Dryopteris papuae-novae-guineae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris papuae-novae-guineae, commonly known as the New Guinea cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, finely divided, bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
