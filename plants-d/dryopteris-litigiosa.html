                    <h1>Dryopteris litigiosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris litigiosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
