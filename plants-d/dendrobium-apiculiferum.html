                    <h1>Dendrobium apiculiferum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium apiculiferum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like structure that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium apiculiferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
