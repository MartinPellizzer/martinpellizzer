<p>Dryopteris duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
