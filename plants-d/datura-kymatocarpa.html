                    <h1>Datura kymatocarpa</h1>
<p>Datura kymatocarpa, commonly known as the desert datura, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are broad and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Datura kymatocarpa is also known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids in its flowers and leaves.</p>
