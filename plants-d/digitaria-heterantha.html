<p>Digitaria heterantha, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has potential uses in erosion control.</p>
