<p>Diplomorpha elongata var. recurva, commonly known as the recurved whipstick, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often curling or twisting in response to environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
