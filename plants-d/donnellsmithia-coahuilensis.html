The plant thrives in arid environments, adapting to extreme heat and limited water availability through its thick, fleshy foliage. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
