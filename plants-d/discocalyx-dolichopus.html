<p>Discocalyx dolichopus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap, typical of the Asclepiadaceae family, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Discocalyx dolichopus plays a vital role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
