                    <h1>Dryopteris patens var. lanosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris patens var. lanosa, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year.</p>
<p>It features a short, creeping rhizome with fibrous roots, and its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive silvery-blue underside. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy (lanose) texture on the fronds, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
