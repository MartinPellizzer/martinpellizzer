                    <h1>Drypetes laciniata var. acuta</h1>
<p>Drypetes laciniata var. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed drypetes, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
