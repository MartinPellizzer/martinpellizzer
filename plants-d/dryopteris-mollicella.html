                    <h1>Dryopteris mollicella</h1>
<p>Dryopteris mollicella, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
