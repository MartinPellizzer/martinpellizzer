                    <h1>Dinebra cristata</h1>
<p>Dinebra cristata, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or crown-of-thorns starfish, is a marine species belonging to the family Asteriidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry and a crown-like arrangement of long, spiny arms. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a type of echinoderm, which may be a point of confusion. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical waters, where it plays a significant role in coral reef ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its voracious appetite, it can have a detrimental impact on coral populations when its numbers become excessive.</p>
