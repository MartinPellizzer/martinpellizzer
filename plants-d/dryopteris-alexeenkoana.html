                    <h1>Dryopteris alexeenkoana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris alexeenkoana, commonly known as the Alexandrovsky shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
