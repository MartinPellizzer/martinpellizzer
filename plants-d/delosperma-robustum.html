<p>Delosperma robustum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It grows in a mat-like form, spreading across the ground and forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Delosperma robustum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
