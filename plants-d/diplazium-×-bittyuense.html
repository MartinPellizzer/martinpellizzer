                    <h1>Diplazium × bittyuense</h1>
<p>Diplazium × bittyuense, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sphaericum.</p>
<p>It is a type of fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to its substrate and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
