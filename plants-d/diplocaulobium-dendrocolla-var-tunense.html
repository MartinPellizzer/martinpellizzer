<p>Diplocaulobium dendrocolla var. tunense, commonly known as the tunisian tree fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or arid soils. Its leaves are typically long and pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
