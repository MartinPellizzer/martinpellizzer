                <h1>Dryopteris elongata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris elongata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a slender and often drooping appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its delicate, feathery fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
