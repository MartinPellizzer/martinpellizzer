                    <h1>Danthonia calicina</h1>
<p>Danthonia calicina, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that spread via stolons, making it highly adaptable to various soil types. The plant produces slender, pale green blades with fine, hair-like structures along the leaf margins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
