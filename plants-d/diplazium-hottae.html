<p>Diplazium hottae, commonly known as the Hotta's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Diplazium hottae plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
