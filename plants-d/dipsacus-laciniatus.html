<p>Dipsacus laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved teasel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spiky, cone-like flower heads that are covered in bracts, which are modified leaves. It is a member of the burdock family (Araliaceae) and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Dipsacus laciniatus is known for its historical use in textile production, where its prickly flowers were used to raise the nap on woolen cloth.</p>
