<p>Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
