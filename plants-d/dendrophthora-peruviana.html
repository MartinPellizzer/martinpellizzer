<p>Dendrophthora peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit contains sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora peruviana plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
