                    <h1>Dryopteris guaranitica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
