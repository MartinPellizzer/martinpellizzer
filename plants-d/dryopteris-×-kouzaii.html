                    <h1>Dryopteris × kouzaii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × kouzaii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
