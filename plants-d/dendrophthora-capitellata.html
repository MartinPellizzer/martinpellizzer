                    <h1>Dendrophthora capitellata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora capitellata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora capitellata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
