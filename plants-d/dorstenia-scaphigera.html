                    <h1>Dorstenia scaphigera</h1>
<p>Dorstenia scaphigera, commonly known as the "bottle plant," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within the fleshy stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, adapting to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dorstenia scaphigera is also notable for its ability to climb using its tendrils, making it a versatile and resilient plant in its native habitats.</p>
