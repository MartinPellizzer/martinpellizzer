<p>Dulacia redmondii, commonly known as the Redmond's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks traditional leaves and roots, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often found in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and fragile species within its habitat.</p>
