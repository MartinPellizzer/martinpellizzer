<p>Didissandra chishuiense, commonly known as the Chishui sandarilla, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and somewhat woody fruits. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a somewhat leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
