<p>Ditassa jahnii, commonly known as the Jahnii dittany, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ditassa jahnii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
