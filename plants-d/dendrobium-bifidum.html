                    <h1>Dendrobium bifidum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and blooms with fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that have distinctive bifid (split) petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
