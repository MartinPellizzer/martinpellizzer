                    <h1>Dianthus superbus var. oreadum</h1>
<p>Dianthus superbus var. oreadum, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spherical or conical shape, and it is often found in meadows, cliffs, and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
