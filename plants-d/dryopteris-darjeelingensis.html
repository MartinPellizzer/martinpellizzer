                    <h1>Dryopteris darjeelingensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in rocky or soil-rich substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori, which are clusters of sporangia used for reproduction.</p>
