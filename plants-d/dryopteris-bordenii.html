                    <h1>Dryopteris bordenii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bordenii, commonly known as the Borden's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a series of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
