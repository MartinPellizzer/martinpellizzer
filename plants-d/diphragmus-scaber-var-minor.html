                    <h1>Diphragmus scaber var. minor</h1>
<p>Diphragmus scaber var. minor, commonly known as the roughleaf burrweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
