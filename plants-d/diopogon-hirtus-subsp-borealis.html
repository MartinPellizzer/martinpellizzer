<p>Diopogon hirtus subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and dense, hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
