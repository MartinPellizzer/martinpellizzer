                    <h1>Dracaena terniflora var. heyneana</h1>
<p>Dracaena terniflora var. heyneana, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, dark green leaves with distinctive red or purple edges that add visual interest to any setting. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements.</p>
