                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. sumneviczii</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. sumneviczii, commonly known as the alpine dryas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters of eight, giving it the species name "octopetala.". It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Dryas octopetala.</p>
