                    <h1>Drosera × californica</h1>
<p>Drosera × californica, commonly known as the California sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or peaty soils, often in areas with high humidity. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, and it produces a unique, spiral-like arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species.</p>
