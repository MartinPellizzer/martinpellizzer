<p>Dryopteris panamensis var. proxima, commonly known as the Panamanian shield fern, is a fern species native to Central America, particularly Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
