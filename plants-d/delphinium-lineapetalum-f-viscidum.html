                    <h1>Delphinium lineapetalum f. viscidum</h1>
<p>Delphinium lineapetalum f. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky delphinium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The leaves are palmately compound, with a velvety texture and a distinctive sticky secretion on the surface. This feature, which gives the plant its common name, is thought to deter herbivores and aid in water retention.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
