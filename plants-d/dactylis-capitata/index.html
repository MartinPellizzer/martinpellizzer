                            <h1>Dactylis Capitata</h1>
<p>Dactylis grass, scientifically known as Dactylis capitata, is a hardy perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage that thrives in a variety of soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas due to its adaptability and resilience. Its ability to withstand drought and grazing makes it a valuable forage crop for livestock. With its historical use in agriculture and ecological benefits, Dactylis grass remains an important species in both rural and natural landscapes.</p>
