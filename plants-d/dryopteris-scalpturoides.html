                    <h1>Dryopteris scalpturoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris scalpturoides, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a pale, almost white underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
