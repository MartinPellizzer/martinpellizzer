                    <h1>Dryopteris × heterospora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × heterospora, commonly known as the heterosporous wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both megaspores and microspores on the same fronds, a trait known as heterospory. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, often serrated margin.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
