                    <h1>Dendrocolla pardalis</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla pardalis, commonly known as the golden lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Its coloration, often golden or yellowish, results from the photosynthetic activity of the algal partner.</p>
<p>Dendrocolla pardalis plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
