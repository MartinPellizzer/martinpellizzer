                    <h1>Dryopteris sinica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sinica, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
