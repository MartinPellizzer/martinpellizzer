                    <h1>Dendrophthora intermedia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the health and diversity of the host tree and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
