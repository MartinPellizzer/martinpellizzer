                    <h1>Dracula fernandezii</h1>
<p>Dracula fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's Dracula, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, intricate floral structure, which features long, pendulous sepals and petals that resemble the wings of a bat, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its flowers are typically a deep red or maroon color, which helps attract specific pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracula fernandezii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
