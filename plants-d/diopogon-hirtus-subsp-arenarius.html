<p>Diopogon hirtus subsp.</p>
<p>arenarius, commonly known as the sand diopogon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
