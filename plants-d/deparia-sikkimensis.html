                    <h1>Deparia sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Deparia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Himalayan regions, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped base, which gives it its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance.</p>
