                    <h1>Dichasium</h1>
<p>Dichasium, commonly known as the two-branched flower, is a type of inflorescence found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It consists of two opposite branches, each bearing a cluster of flowers. This structure is characteristic of some species within the family Malvaceae. The dichasium arrangement allows for efficient pollination by increasing the visibility and accessibility of the flowers.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is an important feature in the classification and study of plant morphology.</p>
