                    <h1>Disa torta</h1>
<p>Disa torta, commonly known as the "tortured disa," is a striking South African orchid species characterized by its unique, twisted flower spikes.</p>
<p>It features intricate, often asymmetrical blooms with vividly colored petals and sepals, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat.
