                    <h1>Delphinium azureum var. virescens</h1>
<p>Delphinium azureum var. virescens, commonly known as the Blue Larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of azure-blue, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the delphinium genus. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids.</p>
