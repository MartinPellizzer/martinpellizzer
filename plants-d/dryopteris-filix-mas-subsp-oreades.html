<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>oreades, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common male fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that turn bronze in autumn.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
