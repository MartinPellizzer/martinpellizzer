                    <h1>Dendrobium papilioniferum var. ephemerum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium papilioniferum var. ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its flowers are ephemeral, often lasting only a few days, which adds to its allure and makes it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly endangered and protected in its native region.</p>
