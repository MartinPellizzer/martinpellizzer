<p>Dicliptera ripicola, commonly known as the riparian dicliptera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and floodplains, exhibiting a sprawling or ascending growth habit. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are often inconspicuous but attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Dicliptera ripicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
