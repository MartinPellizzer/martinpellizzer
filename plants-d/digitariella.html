                    <h1>Digitariella</h1>
<p>Digitariella, commonly known as the false button mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, often colorful caps and gilled structures, which are typically found in forested areas. The spores are usually produced in a distinctive, sac-like structure called a vesicle, which is a key feature for identification. While some species are edible, others may be toxic, so caution is advised when foraging.</p>
<p>The genus is widely distributed in temperate regions and plays a role in decomposing organic matter in ecosystems.</p>
