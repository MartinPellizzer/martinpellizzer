                    <h1>Dasistoma quercifolia var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Dasistoma quercifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate oakleaf dasistoma, is a variant of the dasistoma genus native to specific regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, with a broad, ovate shape and serrated edges. The plant typically grows in tropical or subtropical environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-yellow clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The variant intermedia is distinguished by slight differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to other dasistoma species.</p>
