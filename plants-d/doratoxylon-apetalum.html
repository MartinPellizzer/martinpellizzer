                    <h1>Doratoxylon apetalum</h1>
<p>Doratoxylon apetalum, commonly known as the leafless thorned acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and the absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, flattened stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Doratoxylon apetalum plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
