<p>Diplazium textorii, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to surfaces such as tree trunks or rocks. The plant has two types of leaves: sterile, spore-bearing fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like structure, and fertile fronds that are shorter and more upright. Diplazium textorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to grow epiphytically make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
