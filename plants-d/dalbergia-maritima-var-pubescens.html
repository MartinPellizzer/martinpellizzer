<p>Dalbergia maritima var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal ebony, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by elongated, woody pods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
