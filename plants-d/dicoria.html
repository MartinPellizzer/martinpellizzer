                    <h1>Dicoria</h1>
<p>Dicoria, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Dicoria species often grow in wet or marshy habitats, and they are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value and ecological importance make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
