                    <h1>Dendrobium proliferum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium proliferum, commonly known as the orchid with the "clustered" or "branching" growth habit, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, wiry stem that can grow up to several meters in length, often branching at the base to form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium proliferum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
