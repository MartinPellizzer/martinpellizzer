<p>Dendropemon oliganthus, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Dendropemon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, fragrant blooms that typically appear in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
