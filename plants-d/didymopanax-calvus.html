<p>Didymopanax calvus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed banyan, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The tree is notable for its ability to form aerial roots, which can eventually reach the ground and support the plant as a buttressed tree.</p>
