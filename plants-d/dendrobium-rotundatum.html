                    <h1>Dendrobium rotundatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
