<p>Disocactus speciosus subsp.</p>
<p>heterodoxus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often resemble orchid flowers, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
