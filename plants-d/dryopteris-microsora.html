                    <h1>Dryopteris microsora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris microsora, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
