                    <h1>Dictyopteris cumingiana</h1>
<p>Dictyopteris cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's sea palm, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex, branching thallus with a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant forms dense, turfs of flattened, ribbon-like blades that are typically found in shallow, temperate coastal waters. It thrives in intertidal zones and is often associated with rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures of Dictyopteris cumingiana are small and embedded within the thallus, contributing to its reproductive strategy in marine environments.</p>
