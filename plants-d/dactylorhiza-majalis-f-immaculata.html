                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis f. immaculata</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis f. immaculata, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wetlands of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in damp, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its inflorescence consists of several flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and it is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
