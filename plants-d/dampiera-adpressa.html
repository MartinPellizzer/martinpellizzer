<p>Dampiera adpressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dampiera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Dampiera adpressa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
