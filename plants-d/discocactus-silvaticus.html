<p>Discocactus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding a vibrant touch to its dense foliage. Despite its cactus classification, it thrives in humid, shaded environments rather than arid deserts.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in the competitive understory of tropical forests.</p>
