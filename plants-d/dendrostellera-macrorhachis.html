<p>Dendrostellera macrorhachis, commonly known as the broad-ribbed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
