                    <h1>Dichanthium humilius</h1>
<p>Dichanthium humilius, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, exhibiting deep root systems and a high tolerance for poor soil conditions. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, producing light green to golden spikelets that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Dichanthium humilius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
