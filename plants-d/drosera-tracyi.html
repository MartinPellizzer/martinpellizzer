<p>Drosera tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Drosera tracyi is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conditions to thrive.</p>
