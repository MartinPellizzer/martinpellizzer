                <h1>Daucus communis</h1>
<p>Daucus communis, commonly known as wild carrot, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that resemble those of cultivated carrots. The plant produces small, round fruits called mericarps, which are often used as a spice in some cuisines. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to cultivated carrots, it can be mistaken for edible varieties, though it is generally considered non-toxic but not particularly palatable.</p>
