                    <h1>Dendrobium steatoglossum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium steatoglossum, commonly known as the wax-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent, waxy lips. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrobium steatoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure.</p>
