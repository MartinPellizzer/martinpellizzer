                    <h1>Davallia macleayi</h1>
<p>Davallia macleayi, commonly known as the fern moss or hairy shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, mossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
