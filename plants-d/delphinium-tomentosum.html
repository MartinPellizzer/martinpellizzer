                    <h1>Delphinium tomentosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has soft, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Delphinium tomentosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
