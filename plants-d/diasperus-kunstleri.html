                    <h1>Diasperus kunstleri</h1>
<p>Diasperus kunstleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Diasperus kunstleri is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
