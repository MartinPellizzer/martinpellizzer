                    <h1>Draba verna var. breviscapa</h1>
<p>Draba verna var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and early blooming period, it is an important early nectar source for pollinators.</p>
