<p>Dianthus rupicola subsp.</p>
<p>hermaeensis, commonly known as the Hermaeensis Campion, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
