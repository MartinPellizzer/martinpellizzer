                    <h1>Dasiphora fruticosa var. fruticosa</h1>
<p>Dasiphora fruticosa var. fruticosa, commonly known as Indian paintbrush, is a perennial shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
