                    <h1>Dryopteris lustrata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lustrata, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
