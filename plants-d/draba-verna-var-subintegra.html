                    <h1>Draba verna var. subintegra</h1>
<p>Draba verna var. subintegra, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered in small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates.</p>
