                    <h1>Dryopteris distantipinna</h1>
<p>Dryopteris distantipinna, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
