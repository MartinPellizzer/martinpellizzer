<p>Drosera falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Islands Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Falkland Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments, such as bogs and peatlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of dew-like secretions.</p>
<p>Drosera falconeri is a rare and specialized species, adapted to the harsh, wind-swept conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
