<p>Dryopteris perakensis, commonly known as the Pennsylvania shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months.</p>
