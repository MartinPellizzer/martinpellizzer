<p>Dryopteris rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing along streams and in shaded forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate high humidity and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
