                    <h1>Diplazium decurrenti-alatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium decurrenti-alatum, commonly known as the spreading rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a gradual reduction in size towards the tips, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
