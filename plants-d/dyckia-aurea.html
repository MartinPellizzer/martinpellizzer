<p>Dyckia aurea, commonly known as the golden dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The leaves are often bright green with a yellowish or golden hue, especially in direct sunlight. It produces striking orange to red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
