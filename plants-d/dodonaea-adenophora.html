                    <h1>Dodonaea adenophora</h1>
<p>Dodonaea adenophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native environments.</p>
