                    <h1>Didymoglossum filicula</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum filicula, commonly known as the small-leaf field moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of oil. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It typically grows in dense clusters on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum filicula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
