<p>Ditaxis odontophylla, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions.</p>
