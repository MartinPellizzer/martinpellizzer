                    <h1>Dryas octopetala alaskensis</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaskan mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh cold and wind. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and arctic heath habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
