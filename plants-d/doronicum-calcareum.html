                    <h1>Doronicum calcareum</h1>
<p>Doronicum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine down, which helps to reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Doronicum calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
