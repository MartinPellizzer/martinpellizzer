                    <h1>Dryopteris spinulosa var. fructuosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spinulosa var. fructuosa, commonly known as the fruiting wood fern, is a variant of the spinulose wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features frond-like leaves that are pinnately divided with a distinctive, serrated edge. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique fruiting structures, which are more developed than in the typical form of the species.</p>
