                    <h1>Dennstaedtia melanostipes</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia melanostipes, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in wet soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
