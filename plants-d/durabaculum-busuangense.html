                    <h1>Durabaculum busuangense</h1>
<p>Durabaculum busuangense, commonly known as the Busuang rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet elegant presence to its rocky habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation and limited research, its conservation status remains uncertain.</p>
