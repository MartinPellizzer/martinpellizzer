<p>Dryas ajanensis subsp.</p>
<p>ochotensis, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments, where it is adapted to harsh, cold conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open, well-drained soils and is a hardy plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
