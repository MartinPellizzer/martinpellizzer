                    <h1>Dendrobium niveobarbatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium niveobarbatum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
