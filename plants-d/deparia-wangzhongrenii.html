<p>Deparia wangzhongrenii, commonly known as the Wangzhongren's wood fern, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive pattern of sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures are arranged in a linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
