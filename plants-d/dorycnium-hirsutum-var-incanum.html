<p>Dorycnium hirsutum var. incanum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its capacity to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
