                    <h1>Dendrobium acuminatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium acuminatum, commonly known as the acuminatum orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, spurred flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Dendrobium acuminatum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
