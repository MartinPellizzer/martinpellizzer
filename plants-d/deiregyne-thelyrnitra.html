<p>Deiregyne thelyrnitra, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
