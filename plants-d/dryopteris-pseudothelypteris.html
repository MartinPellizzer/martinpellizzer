                    <h1>Dryopteris pseudothelypteris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pseudothelypteris, commonly known as the false bird's-nest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture.</p>
