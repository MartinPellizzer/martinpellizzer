<p>Dennstaedtia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
