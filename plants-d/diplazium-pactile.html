<p>Diplazium pactile, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique ability to spread through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes.</p>
<p>It has feather-like fronds that are typically green and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Diplazium pactile thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes allow it to form dense colonies, making it both a common and persistent ground cover in its native habitat.</p>
