<p>Daemonorops korthalsii, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
