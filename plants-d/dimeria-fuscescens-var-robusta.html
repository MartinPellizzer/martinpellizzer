                    <h1>Dimeria fuscescens var. robusta</h1>
<p>Dimeria fuscescens var. robusta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiky seed heads that disperse its seeds via the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Dimeria fuscescens var. robusta plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
