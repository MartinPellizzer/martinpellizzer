<p>Diervilla floribunda var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, arching branches covered with oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy floral display.</p>
