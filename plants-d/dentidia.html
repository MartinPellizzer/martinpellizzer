                    <h1>Dentidia</h1>
<p>Dentidia, commonly known as the "toothed grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Dentidia species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. They have a fibrous root system and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The name "Dentidia" refers to the tooth-like structures on the edges of their leaves, which aid in water retention and defense against herbivores.</p>
