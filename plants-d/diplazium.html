                    <h1>Diplazium</h1>
<p>Diplazium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and the presence of two types of fronds—sterile and fertile—hence the name "diplazium," derived from the Greek "di" (two) and "plasis" (formation). The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. Diplazium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
