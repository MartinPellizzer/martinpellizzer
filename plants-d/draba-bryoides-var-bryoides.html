<p>Draba bryoides var. bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of small, fleshy leaves that resemble moss, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, typically blooming before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Draba bryoides var. bryoides is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
