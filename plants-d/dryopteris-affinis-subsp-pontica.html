<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>pontica, commonly known as the Pontic wood fern, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
