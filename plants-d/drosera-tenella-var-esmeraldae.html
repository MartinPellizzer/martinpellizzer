                    <h1>Drosera tenella var. esmeraldae</h1>
<p>Drosera tenella var. esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the variety 'esmeraldae' is distinguished by its particularly vibrant green coloration.</p>
<p>This species thrives in boggy, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth.</p>
