<p>Dictyogramme pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of understory vegetation in forest ecosystems.</p>
