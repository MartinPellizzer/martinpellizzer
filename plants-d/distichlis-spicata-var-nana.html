                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. nana</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf saltgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought resistance make it well-suited for erosion control in arid and coastal regions.</p>
