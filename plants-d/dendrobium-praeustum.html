<p>Dendrobium praeustum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium praeustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
