                    <h1>Doryopteris veitchii</h1>
<p>Doryopteris veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
