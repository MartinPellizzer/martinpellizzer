                <h1>Derris uliginosa</h1>
<p>Derris uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp derris, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly rotenone, which makes it toxic to mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often used in traditional pest control methods rather than as a food or medicinal plant.</p>
