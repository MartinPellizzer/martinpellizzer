                    <h1>Dicranopteris squamulosa var. gunckeliana</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris squamulosa var. gunckeliana, commonly known as the Gunckel's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Dicranopteris.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating vegetation. Its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
