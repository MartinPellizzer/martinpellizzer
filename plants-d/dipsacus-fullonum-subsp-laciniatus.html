<p>Dipsacus fullonum subsp.</p>
<p>laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often deeply cut.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
