<p>Anderson's larkspur, scientifically known as Delphinium tricorne var. andersonii, is a rare and striking wildflower native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This variant of the larkspur species is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flower spikes and vivid blue or purple blooms that stand out in its alpine habitat. Found primarily in Idaho and Montana, it thrives in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive. Despite its beauty, Anderson's larkspur is toxic to both humans and animals, making it a plant of caution as well as wonder. Its limited distribution and delicate nature have made it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
