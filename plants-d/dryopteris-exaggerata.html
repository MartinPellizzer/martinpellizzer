                    <h1>Dryopteris exaggerata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris exaggerata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
