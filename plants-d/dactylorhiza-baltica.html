<p>Dactylorhiza baltica, commonly known as the Baltic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
