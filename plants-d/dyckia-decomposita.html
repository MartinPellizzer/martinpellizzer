                    <h1>Dyckia decomposita</h1>
<p>Dyckia decomposita, commonly known as the clustered dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit with stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia decomposita is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
