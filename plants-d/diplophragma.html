                    <h1>Diplophragma</h1>
<p>Diplophragma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Diplophragma species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
