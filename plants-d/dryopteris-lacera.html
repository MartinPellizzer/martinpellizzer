                    <h1>Dryopteris lacera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lacera, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often finely divided and covered in small, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
