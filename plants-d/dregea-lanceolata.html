                    <h1>Dregea lanceolata</h1>
<p>Dregea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dregea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
