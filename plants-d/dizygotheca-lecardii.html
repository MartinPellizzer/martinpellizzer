<p>Dizygotheca lecardii, commonly known as the lecard's dichotomous acanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, dichotomous branching pattern and showy, violet-blue bracts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
