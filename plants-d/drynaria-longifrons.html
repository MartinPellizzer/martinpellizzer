<p>Drynaria longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded cliff fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
