                    <h1>Dontostemon dentatus var. eglandulosus</h1>
<p>Dontostemon dentatus var. eglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins and a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. Its glandular surfaces on the leaves and stems are distinctive and contribute to its adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in open, sun-exposed areas such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly soils.</p>
