                    <h1>Dryopteris kuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant forms compact clumps and has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread slowly over time. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
