                    <h1>Dispermotheca viscosa var. lusitanica</h1>
<p>Dispermotheca viscosa var. lusitanica, commonly known as the sticky dispersotheca, is a variant of the Dispermotheca genus native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its viscid, sticky surface on its fruits, which aids in seed dispersal by adhering to animals or human clothing. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a glossy appearance, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
