                    <h1>Diatrema</h1>
<p>Diatrema, commonly known as the "ghost pipe," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Diatrema species are typically found in forested areas, often growing on the roots of trees. They have slender, leafless stems and produce small, white or greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Diatrema fimbriatum and Diatrema tenuifolium, which are native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
