<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, often silver-gray foliage and its clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
