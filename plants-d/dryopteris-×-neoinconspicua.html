                    <h1>Dryopteris × neoinconspicua</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × neoinconspicua, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces fertile spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage.</p>
