<p>Draba humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in the mild, Mediterranean climate. It produces yellow or white flowers in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Draba humboldtii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
