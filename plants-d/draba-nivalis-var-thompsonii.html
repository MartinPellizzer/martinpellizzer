                    <h1>Draba nivalis var. thompsonii</h1>
<p>Draba nivalis var. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's alpine draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky slopes and scree. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
