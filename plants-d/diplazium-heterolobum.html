                    <h1>Diplazium heterolobum</h1>
<p>Diplazium heterolobum, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into lobes with varying shapes and sizes. The plant exhibits a distinctive heteromorphic growth pattern, with the sporophylls differing in shape from the sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
