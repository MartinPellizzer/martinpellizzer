<p>Drimys winteri var. semiglobosa, commonly known as the Chilean pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can tolerate mild frost, making it a hardy species in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it a popular choice for landscaping in southern regions.</p>
