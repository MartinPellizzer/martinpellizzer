<p>Dactylorhiza elata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy white or pale yellow flower. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
