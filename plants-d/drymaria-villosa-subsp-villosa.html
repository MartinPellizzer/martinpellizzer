<p>Drymaria villosa subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually oval or rounded, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering them.</p>
