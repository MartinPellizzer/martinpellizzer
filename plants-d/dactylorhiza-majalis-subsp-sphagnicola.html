<p>Dactylorhiza majalis subsp.</p>
<p>sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, moist habitats such as bogs and peatlands, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, often branched stem that bears several pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil in which it thrives.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
