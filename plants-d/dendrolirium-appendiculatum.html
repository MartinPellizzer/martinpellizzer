<p>Dendrolirium appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate forest lily, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
