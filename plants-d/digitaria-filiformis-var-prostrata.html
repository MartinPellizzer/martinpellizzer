                    <h1>Digitaria filiformis var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Digitaria filiformis var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate digit grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, thread-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
