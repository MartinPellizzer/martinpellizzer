                    <h1>Dryopteris elmerorum</h1>
<p>Dryopteris elmerorum, commonly known as Elmer's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
