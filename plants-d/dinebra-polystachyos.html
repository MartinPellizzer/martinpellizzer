                    <h1>Dinebra polystachyos</h1>
<p>Dinebra polystachyos, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which later develop into fluffy white seeds for wind dispersal. Its leaves contain a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common trait among plants in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Dinebra polystachyos is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
