<p>Dryopteris neofuscipes, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a dark brown to rusty-colored margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a compact and dense structure that helps it thrive in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
