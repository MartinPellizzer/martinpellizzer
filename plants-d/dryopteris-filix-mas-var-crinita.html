                    <h1>Dryopteris filix-mas var. crinita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris filix-mas var. crinita, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas. The fronds are long, narrow, and have a soft, fuzzy texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in the right growing conditions.</p>
