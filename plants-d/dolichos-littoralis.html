<p>Dolichos littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dolichos, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant features slender, trailing stems with small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>Dolichos littoralis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
