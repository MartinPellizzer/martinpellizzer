<p>Draba bellii, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Draba bellii is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, wind-swept environments.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils make it a characteristic species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
