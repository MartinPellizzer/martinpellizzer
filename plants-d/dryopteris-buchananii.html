<p>Dryopteris buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
