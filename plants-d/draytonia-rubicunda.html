<p>Draytonia rubicunda, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its stems are reddish in color, which helps distinguish it from other bladderwort species.</p>
<p>Draytonia rubicunda is an important indicator species for healthy aquatic ecosystems due to its sensitivity to water quality.</p>
