<p>Dichostylis congesta, commonly known as the clustered dichostylis, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces two types of flowers—sterile and fertile—on separate stems, a feature known as dichogamy.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
