                    <h1>Decumaria sinensis</h1>
<p>Decumaria sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese climbing fern, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spore-bearing cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats.</p>
