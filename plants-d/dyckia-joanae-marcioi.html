                    <h1>Dyckia joanae-marcioi</h1>
<p>Dyckia joanae-marcioi, commonly known as the Joanae-Marcioi Dyckia, is a compact, low-growing bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with red or orange bracts, which attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia joanae-marcioi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
