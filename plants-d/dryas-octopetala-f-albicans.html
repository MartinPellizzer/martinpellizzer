                    <h1>Dryas octopetala f. albicans</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala f. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with a rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves and stems are covered in dense, soft hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is a striking example of adaptive evolution in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
