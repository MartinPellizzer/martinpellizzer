<p>Dianthus vulturius subsp.</p>
<p>vulturius, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble the head of a death's-head hawkmoth.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It blooms from June to August, producing fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers with a unique, moth-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
