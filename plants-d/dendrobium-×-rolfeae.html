                    <h1>Dendrobium × rolfeae</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × rolfeae, commonly known as the Phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from various dendrobium species.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including white, pink, and purple, and can bloom multiple times a year.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
