<p>Delphinium grandiflorum f. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular-flowered larkspur, is a variant of the tall larkspur characterized by its distinctive glandular hairs on the stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This perennial herbaceous plant is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The glandular structures on its foliage are a notable botanical feature, contributing to its unique appearance and possibly playing a role in chemical defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and striking floral display.</p>
