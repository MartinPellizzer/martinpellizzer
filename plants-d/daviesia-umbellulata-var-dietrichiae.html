<p>Daviesia umbellulata var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the Dietrich's hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions.</p>
