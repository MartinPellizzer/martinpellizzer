                    <h1>Diplazium manilense</h1>
<p>Diplazium manilense, commonly known as the Manila brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of fronds: sterile and fertile. The sterile fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a rough texture, while the fertile fronds bear spore-bearing structures called sori. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes.</p>
