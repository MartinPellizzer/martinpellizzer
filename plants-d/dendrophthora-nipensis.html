                    <h1>Dendrophthora nipensis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora nipensis, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to Japan and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment.</p>
