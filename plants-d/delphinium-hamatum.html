                    <h1>Delphinium hamatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium hamatum, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to six feet in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often avoided in gardens for safety reasons.</p>
