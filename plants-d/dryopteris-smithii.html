                    <h1>Dryopteris smithii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris smithii, commonly known as Smith's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
