<p>Diplopappus pulicarius, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its resilience to drought and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
