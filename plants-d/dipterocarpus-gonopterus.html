                    <h1>Dipterocarpus gonopterus</h1>
<p>Dipterocarpus gonopterus, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its buttressed roots that help it thrive in swampy or wetland environments. The tree produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and furniture, though it is also important for biodiversity as a habitat for many species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of tropical rainforests.</p>
