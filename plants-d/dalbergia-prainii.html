<p>Dalbergia prainii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
