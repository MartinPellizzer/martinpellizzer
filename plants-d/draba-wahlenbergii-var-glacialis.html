                    <h1>Draba wahlenbergii var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Draba wahlenbergii var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinct four-petaled flowers.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme environments makes it an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
