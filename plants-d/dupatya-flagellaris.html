                    <h1>Dupatya flagellaris</h1>
<p>Dupatya flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of a flagellum. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique linear pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dupatya flagellaris is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
