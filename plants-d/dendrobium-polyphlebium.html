                    <h1>Dendrobium polyphlebium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium polyphlebium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium polyphlebium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
