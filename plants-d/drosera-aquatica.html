                    <h1>Drosera aquatica</h1>
<p>Drosera aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, hair-like structures called tentacles that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically small and floating, with the ability to curl around prey to aid in digestion. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments by supplementing its diet with captured insects.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptation allows it to survive in habitats where other plants cannot.</p>
