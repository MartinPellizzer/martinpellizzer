                    <h1>Decaspora disticha</h1>
<p>Decaspora disticha, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and its flowers are typically white or pale green, clustered in inflorescences. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to forest ecosystems.</p>
