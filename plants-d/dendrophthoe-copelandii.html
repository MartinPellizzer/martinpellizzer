                    <h1>Dendrophthoe copelandii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe copelandii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with the host, extracting water and minerals through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe copelandii is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, contributing to the complex ecological interactions within tropical forests.</p>
