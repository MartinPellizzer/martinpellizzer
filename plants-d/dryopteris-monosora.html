                    <h1>Dryopteris monosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris monosora, commonly known as the single-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, single, elongated leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are usually narrowly lance-shaped. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
