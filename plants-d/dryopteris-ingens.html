                    <h1>Dryopteris ingens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ingens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
