<p>Drymaria laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Drymaria laxiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local pollinators.</p>
