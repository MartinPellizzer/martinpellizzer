                    <h1>Dendrobium senile</h1>
<p>Dendrobium senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, hanging clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers that resemble a beard. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its stems are often branched and can become woody over time.</p>
<p>Dendrobium senile prefers bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>
