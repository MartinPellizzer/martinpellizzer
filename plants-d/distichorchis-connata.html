<p>Distichorchis connata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial with a slender, grass-like appearance and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Distichorchis connata is an indicator species for undisturbed forest habitats and is often found in association with other orchids in the same ecosystem.</p>
