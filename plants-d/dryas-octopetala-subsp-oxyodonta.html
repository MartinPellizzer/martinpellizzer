<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>oxyodonta, commonly known as the alpine frostflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
