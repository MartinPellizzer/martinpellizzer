<p>Desmanthus fruticosus, commonly known as the prickly bushbean, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with slender, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing several elliptical seeds.
