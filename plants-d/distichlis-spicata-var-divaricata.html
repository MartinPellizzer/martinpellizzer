                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. divaricata</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. divaricata, commonly known as saltbush or sea grass, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It has flat, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
