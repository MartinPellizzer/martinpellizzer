                    <h1>Dryopteris burnatii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it forms dense colonies on rocky or soil substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
