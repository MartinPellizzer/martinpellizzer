                    <h1>Digitaria ischaemum var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Digitaria ischaemum var. prostrata, commonly known as flatleaf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the ground.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
