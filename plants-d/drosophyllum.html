<p>Drosophyllum, commonly known as the "honeyplant," is a carnivorous plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-like substance to trap insects. The plant's structure includes long, narrow leaves that curl around prey, facilitating digestion. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and predatory behavior make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
