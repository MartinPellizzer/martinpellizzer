                    <h1>Dryopteris exstipellata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris exstipellata, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically unspored and lack the typical fertile fronds seen in other ferns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>While it lacks true spores, it reproduces through a unique form of asexual reproduction known as sporulation in some variations.</p>
