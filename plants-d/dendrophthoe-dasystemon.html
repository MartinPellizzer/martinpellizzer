                    <h1>Dendrophthoe dasystemon</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe dasystemon, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
