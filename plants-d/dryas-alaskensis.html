<p>Dryas alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska mountain avens, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Dryas alaskensis is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and tundra habitats.</p>
