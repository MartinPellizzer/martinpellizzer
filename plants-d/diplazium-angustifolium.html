                    <h1>Diplazium angustifolium</h1>
<p>Diplazium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes that help it spread across the substrate. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided, thread-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium angustifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
