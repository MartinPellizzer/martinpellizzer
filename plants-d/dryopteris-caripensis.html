                    <h1>Dryopteris caripensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris caripensis, commonly known as the Caripé Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
