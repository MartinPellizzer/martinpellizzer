                    <h1>Dendrocnide microstigma</h1>
<p>Dendrocnide microstigma, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub-like plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a potent irritant in its sap, which can cause severe skin reactions in humans. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant can grow up to 3 meters in height.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and animals in its natural habitat.</p>
