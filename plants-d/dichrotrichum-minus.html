                    <h1>Dichrotrichum minus</h1>
<p>Dichrotrichum minus, commonly known as the small hairy grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring or early summer, which are arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, Dichrotrichum minus is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
