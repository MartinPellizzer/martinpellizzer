<p>Damasonium ranunculoides, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and stream edges. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight efficiently. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Damasonium ranunculoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
