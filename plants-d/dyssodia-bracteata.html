                    <h1>Dyssodia bracteata</h1>
<p>Dyssodia bracteata, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy and resilient species in its native range.</p>
