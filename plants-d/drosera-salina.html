                    <h1>Drosera salina</h1>
<p>Drosera salina, commonly known as the salt marsh sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it absorbs nutrients from trapped insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky, digestive enzyme-laden substance. These hairs curl around prey, facilitating digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its adaptation to high-salinity habitats makes it a unique example of plant evolution in challenging environments.</p>
