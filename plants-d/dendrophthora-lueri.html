                    <h1>Dendrophthora lueri</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora lueri, commonly known as the Luer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora lueri plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
