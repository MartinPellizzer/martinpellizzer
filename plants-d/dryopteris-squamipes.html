<p>Dryopteris squamipes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
