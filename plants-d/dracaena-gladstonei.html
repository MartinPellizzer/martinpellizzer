                    <h1>Dracaena gladstonei</h1>
<p>Dracaena gladstonei, commonly known as Gladstone's dracaena, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on tall, branched inflorescences, which appear during the warmer months. Its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Dracaena gladstonei is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
