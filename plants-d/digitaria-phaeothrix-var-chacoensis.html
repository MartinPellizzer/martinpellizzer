<p>Digitaria phaeothrix var. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Chaco region of Argentina and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed glumes, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
