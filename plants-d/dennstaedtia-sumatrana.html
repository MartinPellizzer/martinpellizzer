                    <h1>Dennstaedtia sumatrana</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
