                    <h1>Dryopteris recedens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris recedens, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of polypod fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae that produce spore-bearing sporangia on the underside.</p>
