<p>Dendrobium tosaense var. chingshuishanianum, commonly known as the Chingshuishan dendrobium, is a rare orchid species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a delicate fragrance, and bloom during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
