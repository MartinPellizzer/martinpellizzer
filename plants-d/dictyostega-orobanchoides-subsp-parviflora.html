<p>Dictyostega orobanchoides subsp.</p>
<p>parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of visible leaves and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics as a secondary producer.</p>
