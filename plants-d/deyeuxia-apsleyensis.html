The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding.</p>
