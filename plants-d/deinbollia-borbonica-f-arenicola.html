                    <h1>Deinbollia borbonica f. arenicola</h1>
<p>Deinbollia borbonica f. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a variant of the genus Deinbollia native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers, adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments. It possesses a robust root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and high temperatures makes it well-suited to its harsh habitat.</p>
