                    <h1>Delphinium kamaonense var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Delphinium kamaonense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Kamaon glabrous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, though the varietal name "glabrescens" suggests a reduction in hairiness compared to other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
