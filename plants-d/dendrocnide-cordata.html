<p>Dendrocnide cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf stinging nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fine, stinging hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and animals.</p>
