                    <h1>Dryopteris leprieurii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
