<p>Dicellandra erecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Dicellandra erecta is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians.</p>
