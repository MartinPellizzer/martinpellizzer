<p>Deschampsia austrobohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to central Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often lean over, creating a mat-like appearance. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color, and it blooms with delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Deschampsia austrobohemica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
