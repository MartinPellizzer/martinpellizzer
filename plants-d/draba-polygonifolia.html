                    <h1>Draba polygonifolia</h1>
<p>Draba polygonifolia, commonly known as the polygon-leafed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. Draba polygonifolia is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, which allows it to complete its life cycle quickly.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
