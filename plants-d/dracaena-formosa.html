<p>Dracaena formosa, commonly known as the "Crimson Beauty" or "Coral Dracaena," is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that have a subtle reddish or bronze hue along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena formosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive with minimal care.</p>
