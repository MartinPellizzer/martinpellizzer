<p>Doria virgaurea, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pendulous fruits known as pods. These pods turn from green to reddish-brown as they mature and split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Doria virgaurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
