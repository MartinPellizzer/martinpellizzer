                            <h1>Drynaria Polycarpos</h1>
<p>Ceylon fern, scientifically known as Drynaria polycarpos, is a unique and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. This fern is characterized by its distinctive fronds and robust rhizomes, which allow it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth, it has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant holds cultural and medicinal significance in various traditional practices. Its resilience and beauty make it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and horticultural interest.</p>
