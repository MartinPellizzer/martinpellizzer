                    <h1>Disporum trachycarpum var. subglabrum</h1>
<p>Disporum trachycarpum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf deathcampe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces distinctive, spore-bearing structures called glochidia.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and its role in local ecosystems, though it is also considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides.</p>
