                    <h1>Dendrobium lichenastrum f. prenticei</h1>
<p>Dendrobium lichenastrum f. prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's dendrobium, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate markings. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
