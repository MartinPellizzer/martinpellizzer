                    <h1>Douglasia laevigata var. ciliolata</h1>
<p>Douglasia laevigata var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliated douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, ciliate (fringed) hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
