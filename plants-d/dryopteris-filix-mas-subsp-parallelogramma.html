<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>parallelogramma, commonly known as the shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that often have a distinctive shield-like shape.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage.</p>
