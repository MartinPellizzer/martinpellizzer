<p>Davallia tyermannii, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, often forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a unique, shield-like pattern.</p>
