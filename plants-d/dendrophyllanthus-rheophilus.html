                <h1>Dendrophyllanthus rheophilus</h1>
<p>Dendrophyllanthus rheophilus, commonly known as the river holly, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has a unique morphology with a creeping stem that supports its floating leaves. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion along riverbanks.</p>
