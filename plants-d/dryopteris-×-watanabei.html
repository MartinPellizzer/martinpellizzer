                    <h1>Dryopteris × watanabei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × watanabei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris erythrogramma.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across Japan.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
