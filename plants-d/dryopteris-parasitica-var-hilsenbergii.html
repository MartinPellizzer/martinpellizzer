                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. hilsenbergii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. hilsenbergii, commonly known as the Hilsenberg's barren fern, is a unique variant of the barren fern species.</p>
<p>It is a fern that lacks true leaves, instead producing sporangia directly on its stems. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in small, fleshy structures called indusia.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its specialized adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
