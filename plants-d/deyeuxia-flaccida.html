                    <h1>Deyeuxia flaccida</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia flaccida, commonly known as the soft grass or slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia flaccida is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its use in restoration projects.</p>
