                    <h1>Dendrophthoe biflora</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in pairs, giving it its scientific name. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Dendrophthoe biflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
