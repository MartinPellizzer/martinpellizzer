                    <h1>Diplacus glutinosus var. grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Diplacus glutinosus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance when disturbed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves are a defense mechanism against herbivores and help in seed dispersal.</p>
