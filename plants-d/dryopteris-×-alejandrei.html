The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded garden spaces.</p>
