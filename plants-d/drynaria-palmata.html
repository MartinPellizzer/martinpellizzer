<p>Drynaria palmata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Drynariaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, overlapping scales that resemble bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in strobili at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Drynaria palmata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
