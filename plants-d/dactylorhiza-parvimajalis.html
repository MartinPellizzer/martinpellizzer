<p>Dactylorhiza parvimajalis, commonly known as the small-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. The plant has a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Dactylorhiza parvimajalis is a rare and protected species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
