<p>Dendrobium gynoglottis, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems covered in fleshy, often hairy leaves. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, lip-like structure that is orange to reddish in color.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gynoglottis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
