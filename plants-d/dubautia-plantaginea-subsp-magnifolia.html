<p>Dubautia plantaginea subsp.</p>
<p>magnifolia, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a striking endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous yellow flowers, typically blooming once every few years. It thrives in high-altitude, rocky areas and is adapted to the unique climate of the Haleakalā volcano.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and conservation status, it is a symbol of Hawaii's natural heritage.</p>
