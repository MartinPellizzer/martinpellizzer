<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>viscida, commonly known as the sticky dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and alpine species.</p>
