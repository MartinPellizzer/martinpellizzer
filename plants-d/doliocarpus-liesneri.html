                    <h1>Doliocarpus liesneri</h1>
<p>Doliocarpus liesneri, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by clustered, woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
