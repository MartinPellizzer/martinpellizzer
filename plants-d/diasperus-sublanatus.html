                    <h1>Diasperus sublanatus</h1>
<p>Diasperus sublanatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Diasperus sublanatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high sunlight exposure.</p>
