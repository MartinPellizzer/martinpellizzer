<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology and ability to store water make it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
