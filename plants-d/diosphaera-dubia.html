                    <h1>Diosphaera dubia</h1>
<p>Diosphaera dubia, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often pale green or almost translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume its fruit, which is small and fleshy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Diosphaera dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
