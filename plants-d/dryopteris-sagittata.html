                    <h1>Dryopteris sagittata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically triangular in shape, with a distinctive arrowhead appearance, and they are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive, feathery foliage.</p>
