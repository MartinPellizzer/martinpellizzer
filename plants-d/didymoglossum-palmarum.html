<p>Didymoglossum palmarum, commonly known as the palmate moss, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum palmarum plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
