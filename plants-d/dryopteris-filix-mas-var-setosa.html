<p>Dryopteris filix-mas var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a dense covering of fine, hairy scales on the underside, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
