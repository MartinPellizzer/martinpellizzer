                    <h1>Dolophragma</h1>
<p>Dolophragma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that shifts subtly under different light conditions. The plant's botanical features include milky sap and lanceolate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Dolophragma is relatively rare and requires specific care to flourish in cultivation.</p>
