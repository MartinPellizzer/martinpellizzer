                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia f. breviscapa</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed round-leaved sundew, is a variant of the common sundew.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard form, giving it a distinct appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to supplement its nutrient intake through insect capture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
