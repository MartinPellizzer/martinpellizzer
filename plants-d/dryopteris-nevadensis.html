                    <h1>Dryopteris nevadensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
