                    <h1>Dendrophthoe lanosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe lanosa, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
