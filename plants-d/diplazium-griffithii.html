<p>Diplazium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Diplazium griffithii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
