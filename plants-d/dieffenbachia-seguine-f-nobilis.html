<p>Dieffenbachia seguine f. nobilis, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature a mix of green, white, and yellow patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are borne on a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children.</p>
