                    <h1>Draba calcicola</h1>
<p>Draba calcicola, commonly known as the limestone draba, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba calcicola thrives in calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments makes it an important indicator species for limestone habitats.</p>
