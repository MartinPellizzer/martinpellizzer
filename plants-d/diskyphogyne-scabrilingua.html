                    <h1>Diskyphogyne scabrilingua</h1>
<p>Diskyphogyne scabrilingua, commonly known as the rough-tongued disk lichen, is a species of foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, disk-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark and wood in moist, temperate forest environments, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. The thallus is covered with a rough, scaly surface, giving it its common name, and it has a pale to dark greenish-blue coloration. It lacks true leaves but has a complex arrangement of filaments that aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
