<p>Dracula insolita, commonly known as the "Vampire Orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble a vampire's fangs. The plant produces dark red to purple flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of blood, contributing to its ominous common name. Dracula insolita is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
