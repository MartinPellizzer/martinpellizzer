<p>Dactylorhiza praetermissa subsp.</p>
<p>schoenophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are specialized for symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
