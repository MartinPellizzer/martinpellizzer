                    <h1>Dendrochilum atjehense</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum atjehense, commonly known as the Atjeh orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
