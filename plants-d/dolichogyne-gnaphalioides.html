<p>Dolichogyne gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature.</p>
<p>Dolichogyne gnaphalioides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
