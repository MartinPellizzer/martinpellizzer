                    <h1>Dryopteris serrulata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris serrulata, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and allow it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
