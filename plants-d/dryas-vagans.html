                    <h1>Dryas vagans</h1>
<p>Dryas vagans, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Dryas vagans is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in harsh conditions where few other plants can survive.</p>
