<p>Didymoglossum hymenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped thalli and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain the plant's spores.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum hymenoides is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
