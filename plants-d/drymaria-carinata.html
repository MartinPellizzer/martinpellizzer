                    <h1>Drymaria carinata</h1>
<p>Drymaria carinata, commonly known as the cushion plant or mountain sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and succulent foliage make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Drymaria carinata is often found in alpine and desert ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
