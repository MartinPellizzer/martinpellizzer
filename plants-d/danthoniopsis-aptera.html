The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are inconspicuous, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
