<p>Draba altaica var. racemosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
