                    <h1>Dendrocolla rhopalorrhachis</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla rhopalorrhachis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the cycad family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves and a robust, unbranched trunk that can grow several meters tall. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor environments, with a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
