<p>Drosera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense covering of glandular hairs that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette of broad, hairy leaves. Its flowers are small and pinkish-red, appearing on a single stem above the rosette.</p>
<p>Drosera tomentosa is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
