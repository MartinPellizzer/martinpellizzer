                    <h1>Draba vulgaris var. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Draba vulgaris var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the slenderleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, basal leaves that are often sessile, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its ecological niche, with compact growth habits that help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
