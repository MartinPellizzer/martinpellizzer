The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena finlaysonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in indoor gardening due to its air-purifying properties.</p>
