<p>Desmodium adhaesivum, commonly known as sticky top, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive, sticky glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Desmodium adhaesivum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and suppress weed growth.</p>
