The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
