                    <h1>Dryopteris crypta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris crypta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
