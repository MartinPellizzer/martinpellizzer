                    <h1>Dendrophthora obliqua</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora obliqua, commonly known as the oblique bracket fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily grows on decaying hardwoods.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bracket-like fruiting bodies, which are typically brown to reddish-brown in color. This fungus is saprophytic, meaning it decomposes dead organic matter, playing a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. It is often found on the trunks and branches of trees such as oaks and maples.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of mature, undisturbed forest environments.</p>
