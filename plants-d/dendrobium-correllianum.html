<p>Dendrobium correllianum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in horticulture.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
