                    <h1>Dryopteris × haganecola</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × haganecola, commonly known as the Haganecola wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage.</p>
