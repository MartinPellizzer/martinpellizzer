<p>Diplazium mutabile, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are bipinnate and often have a distinctive, variable appearance.
