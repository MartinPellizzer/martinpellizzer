<p>Dicksonia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome produces roots that anchor it firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
