                    <h1>Dicrastylis</h1>
<p>Dicrastylis, commonly known as the star sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. They are typically found in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Dicrastylis species often have rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale green or brown, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
