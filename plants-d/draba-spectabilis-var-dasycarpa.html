<p>Draba spectabilis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the showy whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are short and often branched.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy fruits, which contribute to its specific name *dasycarpa*, meaning "thick-fruited.".</p>
