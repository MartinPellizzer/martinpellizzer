                    <h1>Dryopteris bodinieri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, round sporangia clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
