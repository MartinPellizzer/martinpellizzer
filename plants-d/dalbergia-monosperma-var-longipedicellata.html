<p>Dalbergia monosperma var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

The leaves are alternate, pinnate, and consist of several pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single large, hard seed.</p>
<p>It is valued for its dense, dark wood used in furniture and musical instruments, though it is also threatened by overharvesting.</p>
