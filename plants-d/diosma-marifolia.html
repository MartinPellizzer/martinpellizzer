<p>Diosma marifolia, commonly known as the coastal diosma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and can become branched with age.</p>
<p>Diosma marifolia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity found in coastal ecosystems.</p>
