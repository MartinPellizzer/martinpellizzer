                    <h1>Dryas tenella</h1>
<p>Dryas tenella, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
