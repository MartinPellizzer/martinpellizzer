                    <h1>Dryopteris omeiensis var. flexilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris omeiensis var. flexilis, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a variant of the Omei wood fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often curved and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
