                    <h1>Dactylis polygama var. geomastrix</h1>
<p>Dactylis polygama var. geomastrix, commonly known as the mountain brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
