<p>Digitaria glabriculmis, commonly known as the smooth bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often form dense turf-like growth. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves with a smooth texture and lacks the hairy appearance seen in some related species. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>Digitaria glabriculmis is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and sandy soils.</p>
