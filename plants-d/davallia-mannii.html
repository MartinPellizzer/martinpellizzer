<p>Davallia mannii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Davallia mannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>
