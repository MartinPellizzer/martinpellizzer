                    <h1>Dryopteris nigra</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
