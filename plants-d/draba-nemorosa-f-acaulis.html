                    <h1>Draba nemorosa f. acaulis</h1>
<p>Draba nemorosa f. acaulis, commonly known as the cushion draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, upright stalks. Its compact structure helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions, such as strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
