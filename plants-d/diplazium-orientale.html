                    <h1>Diplazium orientale</h1>
<p>Diplazium orientale, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Diplazium orientale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
