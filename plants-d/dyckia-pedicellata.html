                    <h1>Dyckia pedicellata</h1>
<p>Dyckia pedicellata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
