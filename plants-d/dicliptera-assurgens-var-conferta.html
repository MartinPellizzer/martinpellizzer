                    <h1>Dicliptera assurgens var. conferta</h1>
<p>Dicliptera assurgens var. conferta, commonly known as the dense blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth, it can form thick mats that help prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for various small organisms.</p>
