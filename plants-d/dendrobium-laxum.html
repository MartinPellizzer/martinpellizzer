<p>Dendrobium laxum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium laxum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
