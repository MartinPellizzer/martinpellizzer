<p>Diplazium spiniferum, commonly known as the spiniferous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>Diplazium spiniferum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
