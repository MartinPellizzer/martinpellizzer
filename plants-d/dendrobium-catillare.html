                    <h1>Dendrobium catillare</h1>
<p>Dendrobium catillare, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin stems covered with numerous small, leaf-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium catillare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
