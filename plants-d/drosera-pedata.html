<p>Drosera pedata, commonly known as the Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red.</p>
<p>Drosera pedata is a hardy species that can thrive in a variety of moist, sunny conditions.</p>
