                    <h1>Dendrobium montis-movi</h1>
<p>Dendrobium montis-movi, commonly known as the mountain-moving orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant possesses a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapting to its arid mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
