                    <h1>Daucus incognitus</h1>
<p>Daucus incognitus, commonly known as the unknown carrot, is a wild species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in parts of Europe and western Asia. Its root is not as commonly cultivated as the domesticated carrot but is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant species.</p>
