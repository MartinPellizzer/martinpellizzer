<p>Deilosma albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Deilosma albiflorum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune ecosystems.</p>
