<p>Dendrobium roseicolor, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are striking, with a mix of pink and white petals, often with a contrasting lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium roseicolor thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
