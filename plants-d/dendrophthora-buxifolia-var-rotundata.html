                    <h1>Dendrophthora buxifolia var. rotundata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora buxifolia var. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded boxwood mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits the branches of boxwood trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is typically small, oval-shaped, and has a rounded appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas where its host trees are present.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant over time if left unchecked.</p>
