<p>Dicranolepis talbotiorum, commonly known as the Talbot's haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and dark green, wiry leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and are often surrounded by a peristome.</p>
<p>Dicranolepis talbotiorum is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions.</p>
