                    <h1>Dissotidendron melleri var. greenwayi</h1>
<p>Dissotidendron melleri var. greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries that contain its seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
