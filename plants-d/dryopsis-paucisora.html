                    <h1>Dryopsis paucisora</h1>
<p>Dryopsis paucisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryopsis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southwestern regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale yellow or cream, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Dryopsis paucisora is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.</p>
