<p>Daucus gingidium subsp.</p>
<p>majoricus, commonly known as the Kashmir carrot, is a wild relative of the common carrot. It is native to the Himalayas and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower heads.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its taproot is typically smaller and less developed compared to cultivated carrots, but it contains similar compounds like falcarinol.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and plant breeders due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value.</p>
