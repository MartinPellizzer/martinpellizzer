<p>Dicranopteris pteridella, commonly known as the small water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
