                    <h1>Dendrophthora lacryma-jobi</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora lacryma-jobi, commonly known as the lacryma-jobi tree fungus, is a unique parasitic plant that grows on the bark of certain trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tear-shaped leaves that resemble drops of water, hence its common name. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized relationship with host trees and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
