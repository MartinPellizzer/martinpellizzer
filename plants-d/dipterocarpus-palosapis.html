<p>Dipterocarpus palosapis, commonly known as the Philippine dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall stature and buttressed roots, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain seeds, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in the ecological structure of lowland dipterocarp forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
