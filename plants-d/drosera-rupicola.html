<p>Drosera rupicola, commonly known as the rock sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape.</p>
<p>Drosera rupicola is a small, compact plant that produces delicate pink or red flowers during the growing season.</p>
