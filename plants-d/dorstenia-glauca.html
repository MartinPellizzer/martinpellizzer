                    <h1>Dorstenia glauca</h1>
<p>Dorstenia glauca, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Dorstenia glauca is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
