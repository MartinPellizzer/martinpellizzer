                    <h1>Dryopteris loxoscaphoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris loxoscaphoides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
