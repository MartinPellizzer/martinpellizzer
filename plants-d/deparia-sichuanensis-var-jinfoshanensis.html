                    <h1>Deparia sichuanensis var. jinfoshanensis</h1>
<p>Deparia sichuanensis var. jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern genus Deparia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia. It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, shaded streams and pools.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
