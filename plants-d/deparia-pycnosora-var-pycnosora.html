<p>Deparia pycnosora var. pycnosora, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features compound, pinnately divided leaves that are typically broad and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dense, compact growth habit and robust foliage.</p>
