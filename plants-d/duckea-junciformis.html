<p>Duckea junciformis, commonly known as the slender sedgeland duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It reproduces vegetatively through the production of buds that detach and float to new locations.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
