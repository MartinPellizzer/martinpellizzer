                    <h1>Dryopteris asplenioides var. portoricensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris asplenioides var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
