                    <h1>Donax virgata</h1>
<p>Donax virgata, commonly known as the Virginia saltmarsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass found in coastal wetlands along the Atlantic coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and brackish conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing tidal marsh ecosystems. Donax virgata is an important component of salt marsh vegetation, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in fluctuating water levels and high salinity makes it a key indicator of healthy coastal environments.</p>
