                    <h1>Dryopteris chaerophyllifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris chaerophyllifolia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a slightly curled margin.</p>
