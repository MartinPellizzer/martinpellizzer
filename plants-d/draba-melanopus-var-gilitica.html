<p>Draba melanopus var. gilitica, commonly known as the Giltic alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
