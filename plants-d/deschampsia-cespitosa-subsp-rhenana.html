<p>Deschampsia cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>rhenana, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
