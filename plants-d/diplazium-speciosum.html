<p>Diplazium speciosum, commonly known as the golden snake's head, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
