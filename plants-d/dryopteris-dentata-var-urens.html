                    <h1>Dryopteris dentata var. urens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dentata var. urens, commonly known as the Uren's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
