<p>Dryopteris fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and dark green, with a coarse texture that distinguishes it from other fern species.</p>
