                    <h1>Dryopteris versicolor</h1>
<p>Dryopteris versicolor, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that display a range of colors, from green to bronze and even reddish hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
