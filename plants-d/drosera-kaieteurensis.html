<p>Drosera kaieteurensis, commonly known as the Kaieteure pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Kaieteure National Park in Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces a single, urn-shaped flower that is typically red or orange in color. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
