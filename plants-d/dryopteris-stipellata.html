<p>Dryopteris stipellata, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
