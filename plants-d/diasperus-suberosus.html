<p>Diasperus suberosus, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Diasperus suberosus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
