<p>Drynaria propinqua var. mesosora, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and fronds that are typically smaller and more compact compared to the standard variety. The plant exhibits a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical gardens.</p>
