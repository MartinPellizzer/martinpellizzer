                    <h1>Delissea coriacea var. hardyi</h1>
<p>Delissea coriacea var. hardyi, commonly known as the hardy delissea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
