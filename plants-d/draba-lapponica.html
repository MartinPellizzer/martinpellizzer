                    <h1>Draba lapponica</h1>
<p>Draba lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, and its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba lapponica is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and it is known for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
