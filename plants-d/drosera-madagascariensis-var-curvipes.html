<p>Drosera madagascariensis var. curvipes, commonly known as the curved-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically curved, giving it its common name, and they are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
