                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. deflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass or soft grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form a thick, mat-like turf. The leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a ground cover due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
