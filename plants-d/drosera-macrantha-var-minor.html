<p>Drosera macrantha var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, sticky glands on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in a dense cluster.</p>
<p>The varietal form, minor, is distinguished by its smaller size and shorter stalks compared to the typical species.</p>
