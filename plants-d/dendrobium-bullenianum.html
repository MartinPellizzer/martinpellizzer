<p>Dendrobium bullenianum, commonly known as the Bulle's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of brownish bark-like tissue.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bullenianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
