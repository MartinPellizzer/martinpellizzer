                    <h1>Dryopteris canlaonensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris canlaonensis, commonly known as the Canlaon shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid tropical climates.</p>
