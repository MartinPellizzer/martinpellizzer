<p>Decussocarpus piresii, commonly known as the Pires' decussocarpus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral and fruit structures. The plant exhibits a decussate arrangement of its leaves, where opposite leaves are staggered, providing efficient light capture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals, and it produces capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
