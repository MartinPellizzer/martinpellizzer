<p>Dorstenia walleri, commonly known as the "Devil's Tongue," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, tongue-shaped leaves that curl inward when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its stems are often swollen and can store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>Dorstenia walleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and intriguing physical characteristics.</p>
