                    <h1>Dendrobium sarcodes</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sarcodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems covered in a thick, white, waxy coating that gives it its common name. Its flowers are pale green to white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, adding to its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrobium sarcodes is highly sought after in the horticultural trade.</p>
