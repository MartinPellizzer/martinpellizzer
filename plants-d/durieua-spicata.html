                    <h1>Durieua spicata</h1>
<p>Durieua spicata, commonly known as the spiny duriea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated outside of its natural range due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
