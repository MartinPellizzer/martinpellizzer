                    <h1>Dactylorhiza maculata var. hunyadensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza maculata var. hunyadensis, commonly known as the Hungarian spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a distinctive purple or reddish blotch on the underside. The plant produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent purple markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered vulnerable and is protected in several countries.</p>
