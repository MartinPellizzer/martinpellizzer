                    <h1>Daphne haematocarpa</h1>
<p>Daphne haematocarpa, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a fleshy, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and moisture, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, palmate leaves. Its foliage is evergreen in warmer climates but deciduous in colder regions.</p>
<p>Daphne haematocarpa is also noted for its toxic sap, which contains irritants that can cause skin reactions.</p>
