                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. rapensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. rapensis, commonly known as the European hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors. The plant features a rosette of leathery, dark green, tongue-shaped fronds that remain throughout the year. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, mat-like growths.</p>
