<p>Dryopteris disjuncta subsp.</p>
<p>calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea wood fern, is a fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-white due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant prefers calcareous soils and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in specific ecological conditions.</p>
