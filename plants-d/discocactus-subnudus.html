                    <h1>Discocactus subnudus</h1>
<p>Discocactus subnudus, commonly known as the naked disc cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many cacti adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Discocactus subnudus is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
