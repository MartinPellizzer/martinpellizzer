<p>Dudleya cymosa subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the dwarf desert stonecrop, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to coastal scrub habitats in California. It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves arranged in a rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid environments.</p>
