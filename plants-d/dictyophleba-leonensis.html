<p>Dictyophleba leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and rock. It is often found in humid, temperate regions and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its intricate structure and ecological role make it an important subject in lichenology and environmental studies.</p>
