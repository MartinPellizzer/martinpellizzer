                    <h1>Dendrophorbium dolichodoryium</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium dolichodoryium, commonly known as the long-stemmed parasol plant, is a rare and unusual species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that can reach several feet in diameter, composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, low-light habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
