<p>Dendrobium ridleyi, commonly known as the ridley's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its pseudobulbs forming clusters that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, appearing in clusters during the wet season.</p>
<p>Dendrobium ridleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
