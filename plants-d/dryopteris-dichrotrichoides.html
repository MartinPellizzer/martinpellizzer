                    <h1>Dryopteris dichrotrichoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dichrotrichoides, commonly known as the two-colored wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are divided into two distinct color zones, typically green on the upper surface and brown on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fern's unique coloration and structure make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
