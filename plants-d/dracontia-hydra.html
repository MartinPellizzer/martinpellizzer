                    <h1>Dracontia hydra</h1>
<p>Dracontia hydra, commonly known as the water dragon fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its intricate fronds that resemble the tendrils of a dragon.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds with muddy substrates. The plant's rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Dracontia hydra plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
