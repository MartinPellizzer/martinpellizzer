<p>Deschampsia flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>legei, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
