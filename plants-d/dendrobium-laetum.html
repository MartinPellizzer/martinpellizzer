<p>Dendrobium laetum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming in the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrobium laetum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
