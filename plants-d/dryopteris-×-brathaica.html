                    <h1>Dryopteris × brathaica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × brathaica, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
