                    <h1>Diplazium mettenianum var. tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Diplazium mettenianum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water's surface and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a slender, thread-like appearance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in wetlands and ponds.</p>
