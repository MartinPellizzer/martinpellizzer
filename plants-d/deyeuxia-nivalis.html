<p>Deyeuxia nivalis, commonly known as the snow tussock, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-white or grayish foliage, which helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia nivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
