                    <h1>Dryopteris × furadensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × furadensis, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
