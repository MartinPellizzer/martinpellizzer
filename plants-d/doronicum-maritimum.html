                    <h1>Doronicum maritimum</h1>
<p>Doronicum maritimum, commonly known as the sea daisy, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its resilience to maritime environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
