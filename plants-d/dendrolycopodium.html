<p>Dendrolycopodium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their primitive structure, featuring spore-producing cones rather than flowers. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.

<p>Their simple, needle-like leaves and strobilus structures are key botanical features.</p>
