                    <h1>Distylium racemosum f. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Distylium racemosum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and it relies on a symbiotic relationship with its host trees for nutrients. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries and excrete the seeds in new locations.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the structure and diversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
