<p>It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Draba borealis var. kurilensis is adapted to extreme cold and is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems.</p>
