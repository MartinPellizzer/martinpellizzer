                    <h1>Dryopteris silvatica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris silvatica, commonly known as the silvery wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread slowly through underground stolons.</p>
<p>The fronds emerge in spring, unfurling into a graceful, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
