<p>Dalea rosea, commonly known as the rose bush lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy pink to red flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
