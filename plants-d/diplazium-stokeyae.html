                    <h1>Diplazium stokeyae</h1>
<p>Diplazium stokeyae, commonly known as the St. John's Wort fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
