                    <h1>Dryopteris clintoniana var. atropalustris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris clintoniana var. atropalustris, commonly known as the black marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features dark, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
