<p>Dactylorhiza majalis subsp.</p>
<p>praetermissa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a rhizomatous herb with tall, slender stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single spike of white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subdued color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other Dactylorhiza species.</p>
