                    <h1>Davallia subalpina</h1>
<p>Davallia subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, which help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are covered by a protective indusium, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
