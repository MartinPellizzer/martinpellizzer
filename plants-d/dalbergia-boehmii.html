                    <h1>Dalbergia boehmii</h1>
<p>Dalbergia boehmii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
