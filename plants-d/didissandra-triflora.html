<p>Didissandra triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered didissandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional Indigenous practices. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a smooth, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Didissandra triflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
