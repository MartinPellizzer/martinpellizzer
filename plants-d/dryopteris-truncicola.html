                    <h1>Dryopteris truncicola</h1>
<p>Dryopteris truncicola, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris truncicola is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
