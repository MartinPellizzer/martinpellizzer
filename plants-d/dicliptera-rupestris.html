                    <h1>Dicliptera rupestris</h1>
<p>Dicliptera rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to rocky soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in crevices.</p>
<p>Dicliptera rupestris is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
