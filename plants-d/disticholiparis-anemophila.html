                    <h1>Disticholiparis anemophila</h1>
<p>Disticholiparis anemophila, commonly known as the wind-pollinated fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are adapted for efficient wind pollination. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its reproductive strategy relies entirely on wind for the dispersal of spores, making it well-suited to open, windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
