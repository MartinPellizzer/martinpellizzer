                    <h1>Draba mollissima var. compacta</h1>
<p>Draba mollissima var. compacta, commonly known as the compact winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and frost tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
