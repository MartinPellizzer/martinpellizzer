<p>Dortmanna decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, a characteristic that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
