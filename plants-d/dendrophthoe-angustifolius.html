                    <h1>Dendrophthoe angustifolius</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in the canopy of various tree species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its specialized relationship with host plants, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
