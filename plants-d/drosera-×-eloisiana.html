                    <h1>Drosera × eloisiana</h1>
<p>Drosera × eloisiana, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant that combines traits from its parent species, Drosera binata and Drosera elios.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. This hybrid is typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>Drosera × eloisiana is valued by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
