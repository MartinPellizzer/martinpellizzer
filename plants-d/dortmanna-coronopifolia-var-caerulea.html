<p>Dortmanna coronopifolia var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
