<p>Dryopteris morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
