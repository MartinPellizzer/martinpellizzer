                    <h1>Diospyros ferrea var. gillespiei</h1>
<p>Diospyros ferrea var. gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's ironwood, is a rare and hardy species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in xeric habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in botanical studies.</p>
