<p>Drosera parvula subsp.</p>
<p>sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's Sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects for nutrients.</p>

<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
