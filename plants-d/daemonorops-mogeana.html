                    <h1>Daemonorops mogeana</h1>
<p>Daemonorops mogeana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a striking, ancient appearance. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but rare specimen in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Daemonorops mogeana is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>
