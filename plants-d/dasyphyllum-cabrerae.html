<p>Dasyphyllum cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's dasyphyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it has adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dasyphyllum cabrerae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
