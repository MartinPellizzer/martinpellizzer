                    <h1>Daucus atropatanus</h1>
<p>Daucus atropatanus, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and carrots. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Daucus atropatanus make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
