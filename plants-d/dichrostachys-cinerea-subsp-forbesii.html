<p>Dichrostachys cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' stranglewood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Forbes' stranglewood is noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local vegetation dynamics.</p>
