<p>Deschampsia cespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>anadyrensis, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
