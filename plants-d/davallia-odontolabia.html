                    <h1>Davallia odontolabia</h1>
<p>Davallia odontolabia, commonly known as the toothed holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
