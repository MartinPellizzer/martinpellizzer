                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata f. laxa</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata f. laxa, commonly known as the loose-flowered sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and loose, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant.</p>
<p>Its genetic variation in flower structure distinguishes it from the typical form of Dactylis glomerata.</p>
