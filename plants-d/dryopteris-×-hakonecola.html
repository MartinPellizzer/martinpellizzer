                    <h1>Dryopteris × hakonecola</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × hakonecola, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris erythrosora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking gradient of colors, ranging from coppery red at the base to light green at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>This ornamental fern is widely cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings.</p>
