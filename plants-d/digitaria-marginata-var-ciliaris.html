<p>Digitaria marginata var. ciliaris, commonly known as sandbur, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical seed heads that are covered in bristly, hooked hairs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
