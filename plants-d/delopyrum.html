                    <h1>Delopyrum</h1>
<p>Delopyrum, commonly known as the common barley grass, is a member of the Poaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Delopyrum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
