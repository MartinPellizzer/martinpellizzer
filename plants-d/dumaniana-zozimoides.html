<p>Dumaniana zozimoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
