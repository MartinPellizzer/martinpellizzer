<p>Dryopteris villosa var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form opaca distinguishes it from other varieties of Dryopteris villosa by its unique texture and appearance.</p>
