<p>Drosera stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, sticky glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in red or orange-colored glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in marshy or boggy areas.</p>
<p>Drosera stolonifera reproduces through both sexual means and vegetative propagation via stolons.</p>
