                    <h1>Dryopteris × mituii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × mituii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that results from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris japonica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that often display a striking dark green color with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. Its rhizomes are robust and enable it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
