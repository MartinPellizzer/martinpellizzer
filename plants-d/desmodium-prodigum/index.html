                            <h1>Desmodium Prodigum</h1>
<p>Desmodium prodigum is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its unique ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas.</p>
