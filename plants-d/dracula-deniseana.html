                    <h1>Dracula deniseana</h1>
<p>Dracula deniseana, commonly known as the Denise's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals that resemble the appearance of a vampire's face, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically between April and June.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Dracula deniseana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
