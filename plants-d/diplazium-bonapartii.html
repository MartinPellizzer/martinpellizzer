<p>Diplazium bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided and possess a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
