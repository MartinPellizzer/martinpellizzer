                    <h1>Daphnopsis calcicola</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone daphnopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Daphnopsis calcicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
