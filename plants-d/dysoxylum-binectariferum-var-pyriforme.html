<p>Dysoxylum binectariferum var. pyriforme, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are compound, with several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
