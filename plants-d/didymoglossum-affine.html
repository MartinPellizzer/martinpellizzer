<p>Didymoglossum affine, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bog moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. This species is often found in peat bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats across the Northern Hemisphere. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum affine plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat.</p>
