                    <h1>Dicksonia japonica</h1>
<p>Dicksonia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators.</p>
