                    <h1>Daemonorops florida</h1>
<p>Daemonorops florida, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southern United States, particularly Florida.</p>
<p>It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, woody trunk and feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
