<p>Dendrobium chrysopterum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a lip-shaped structure. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
