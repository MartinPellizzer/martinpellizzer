<p>Dendrotrophe varians, commonly known as the variable tree fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic and functional properties.</p>
