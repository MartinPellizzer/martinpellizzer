                    <h1>Ditassa albonerva</h1>
<p>Ditassa albonerva, commonly known as the white-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying white or pale yellow petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
