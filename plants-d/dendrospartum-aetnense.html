                    <h1>Dendrospartum aetnense</h1>
<p>Dendrospartum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna cedar, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a thick canopy. The plant has adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Dendrospartum aetnense is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
