                    <h1>Diazia portulacoides</h1>
<p>Diazia portulacoides, commonly known as the desert cushion, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense clumps make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Diazia portulacoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
