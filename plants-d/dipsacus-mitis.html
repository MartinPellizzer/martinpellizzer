                    <h1>Dipsacus mitis</h1>
<p>Dipsacus mitis, commonly known as the soft burr or hedge bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, soft, spiny burrs that cling to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Dipsacus mitis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
