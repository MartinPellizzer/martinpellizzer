<p>Dichanthium glabrum var. punctatum, commonly known as the punctate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
