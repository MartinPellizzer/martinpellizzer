                    <h1>Dactylorhiza comosa f. kerryensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza comosa f. kerryensis, commonly known as the Kerry orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Ireland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic peat bogs and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short-lived, ephemeral growth cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
