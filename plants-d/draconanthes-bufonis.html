                <h1>Draconanthes bufonis</h1>
<p>Draconanthes bufonis, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that resemble the patterns of a snake's skin, which is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. Draconanthes bufonis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
