                    <h1>Drosera caledonica</h1>
<p>Drosera caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny glands that secrete a viscous, sweet-smelling dew to lure prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>
