                    <h1>Disynaphia albissima</h1>
<p>Disynaphia albissima, commonly known as the white-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and minerals. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of visible leaves and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
