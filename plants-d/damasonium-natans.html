<p>Damasonium natans, commonly known as water starwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Damasonium natans is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats, influencing the aquatic ecosystem.</p>
