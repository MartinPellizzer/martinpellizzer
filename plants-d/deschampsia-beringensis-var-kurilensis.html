<p>Deschampsia beringensis var. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Russian Far East and the Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. This variety thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in tundra and subarctic environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish-brown florets.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, northern habitats.</p>
