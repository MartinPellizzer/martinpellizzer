<p>Dendrobium tripterum, commonly known as the three-winged orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with three prominent petals. Its stems are typically clustered and can grow up to several feet in length.</p>
<p>Dendrobium tripterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
