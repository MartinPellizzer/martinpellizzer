<p>Drosera whittakeri, commonly known as the Whittaker's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and has a rosette structure with small, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and it is often found in swampy or boggy habitats.</p>
<p>Drosera whittakeri is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
