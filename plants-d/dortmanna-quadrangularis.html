<p>Dortmanna quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-cornered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has small, green, four-angled leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. These bladders are covered in a sticky substance that helps in capturing prey.</p>
<p>Dortmanna quadrangularis is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
