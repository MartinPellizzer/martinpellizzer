                    <h1>Dopatrium macranthum</h1>
<p>Dopatrium macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it has a distinctive, branching stem.</p>
<p>Dopatrium macranthum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
