                    <h1>Deyeuxia nardifolia var. elatior</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia nardifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which aids in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
