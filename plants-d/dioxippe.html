                    <h1>Dioxippe</h1>
<p>Dioxippe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are pale green or white, often appearing in clusters, and emit a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Dioxippe is considered a threatened species.</p>
