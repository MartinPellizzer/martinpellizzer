                    <h1>Dendroglossa minor</h1>
<p>Dendroglossa minor, commonly known as the lesser tree frog, is a species of amphibian rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name. I cannot provide information on the botanical features of a non-plant species.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
