                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis lusus carnea</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis lusus carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and has a slender, leafless stem. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, nutrient-poor soils where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
