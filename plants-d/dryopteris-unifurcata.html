<p>Dryopteris unifurcata, commonly known as the single-branched wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into pinnae, which are themselves divided into smaller segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
