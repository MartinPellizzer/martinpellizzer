<p>Diglossophyllum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
