<p>Dracontia papillifera, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Dracontia papillifera is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrition.</p>
