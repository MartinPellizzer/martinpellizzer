<p>It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh climates. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact form and vibrant flowers make it a striking addition to alpine landscapes.</p>
