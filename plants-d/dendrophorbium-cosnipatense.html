                    <h1>Dendrophorbium cosnipatense</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium cosnipatense, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Polylepis*, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Dendrophorbium cosnipatense plays a unique ecological role in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of the cloud forests it inhabits.</p>
