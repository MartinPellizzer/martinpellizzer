                    <h1>Dryopteris schizophylla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a unique, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
