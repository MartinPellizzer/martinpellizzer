                            <h1>Daphne Cneorum Var. Verlotii</h1>
<p>Verlot's daphne, scientifically known as Daphne cneorum var. verlotii, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and striking pinkish-white petals that emit a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens. Despite its beauty, Verlot's daphne requires careful care to thrive, making it a sought-after yet challenging addition to any botanical collection.</p>
