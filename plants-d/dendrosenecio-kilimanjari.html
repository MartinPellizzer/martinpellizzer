<p>Dendrosenecio kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro tree, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant thrives in cool, arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrosenecio kilimanjari is a striking example of adaptive evolution in response to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
