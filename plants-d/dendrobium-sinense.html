                    <h1>Dendrobium sinense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sinense, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sinense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in various growing conditions.</p>
