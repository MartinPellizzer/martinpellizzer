                            <h1>Derwentia Formosa</h1>
<p>Derwentia formosa is a rare and unique plant species native to the remote mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring striking blue and purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical wonder.</p>
