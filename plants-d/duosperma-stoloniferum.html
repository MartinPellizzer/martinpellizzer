                    <h1>Duosperma stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Duosperma stoloniferum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stolons allow it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Duosperma stoloniferum is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
