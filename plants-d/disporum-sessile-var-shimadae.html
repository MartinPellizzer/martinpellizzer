                    <h1>Disporum sessile var. shimadae</h1>
<p>Disporum sessile var. shimadae, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese disporum, is a rare variant of the disporum species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
