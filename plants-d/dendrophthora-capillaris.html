                    <h1>Dendrophthora capillaris</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora capillaris, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthora capillaris plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife.</p>
