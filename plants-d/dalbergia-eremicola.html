                    <h1>Dalbergia eremicola</h1>
<p>Dalbergia eremicola, commonly known as the desert ebony, is a small, deciduous tree native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods containing small, round seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, Dalbergia eremicola is considered an endangered species.</p>
