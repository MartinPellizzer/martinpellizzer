<p>Disa, commonly known as the rain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers. Disa species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce spikes of showy, tubular flowers. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
