<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically unspored, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>While it lacks true spores, it reproduces through the production of sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
