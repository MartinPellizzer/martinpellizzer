<p>Dryopteris × complexa subsp.</p>
<p>transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, serrated margin and a dark green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
