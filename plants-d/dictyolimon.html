<p>Dictyolimon, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Dictyolimon is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert regions of North America and the Mediterranean.</p>
