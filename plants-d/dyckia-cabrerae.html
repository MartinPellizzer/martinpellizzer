<p>Dyckia cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flower bracts that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Dyckia cabrerae is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
