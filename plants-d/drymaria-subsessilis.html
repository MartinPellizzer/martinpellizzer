                    <h1>Drymaria subsessilis</h1>
<p>Drymaria subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and sandy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria subsessilis is often found in disturbed sites, including roadsides and dunes, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
