<p>Dasynema, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the order Ulvales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like structure and is often found in marine environments, particularly in shallow, tide-pool areas. Dasynema thrives in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant is capable of photosynthesis and plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>It is also used in some traditional practices and can be a food source for certain aquatic animals.</p>
