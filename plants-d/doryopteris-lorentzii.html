<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
