                    <h1>Dryadella dressleri</h1>
<p>Dryadella dressleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots that can access underground water sources. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Dryadella dressleri is a symbol of resilience in desert ecosystems and is often found growing in rocky soils or gravelly plains.</p>
