<p>Dendrochilum sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and support the plant's growth, while its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
