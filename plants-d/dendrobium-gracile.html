<p>Dendrobium gracile, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in clusters. Its pseudobulbs are slender and cylindrical, adapted for storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gracile thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
