                    <h1>Dicliptera resupinata</h1>
<p>Dicliptera resupinata, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system that aids in spreading and stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Dicliptera resupinata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils.</p>
