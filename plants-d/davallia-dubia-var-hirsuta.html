<p>Davallia dubia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This varietal is often appreciated for its ornamental value in indoor gardening.</p>
