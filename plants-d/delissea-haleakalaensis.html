The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for the island's biodiversity.</p>
