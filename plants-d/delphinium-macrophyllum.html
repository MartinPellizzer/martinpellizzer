<p>Delphinium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinctive blue-green hue.</p>
<p>Delphinium macrophyllum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content.</p>
