<p>Dendrobium binoculare, commonly known as the two-eyed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, cane-like stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, long-lasting blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Dendrobium binoculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
