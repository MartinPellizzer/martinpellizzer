<p>Dryopteris atrorubens, commonly known as the black and red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
