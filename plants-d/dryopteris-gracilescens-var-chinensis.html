<p>It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that adds to its ornamental value.</p>
