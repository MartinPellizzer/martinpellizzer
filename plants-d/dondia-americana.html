                    <h1>Dondia americana</h1>
<p>Dondia americana, commonly known as the American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, creeping stem. It is native to North America and often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can negatively impact the growth of the plants it parasitizes.</p>
