<p>Dryopteris seemannii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the fall, but the rhizomes remain evergreen, ensuring the plant's survival through seasonal changes.</p>
