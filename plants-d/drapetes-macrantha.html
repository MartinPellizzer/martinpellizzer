<p>Drapetes macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered drapetis, is a striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in humid, cool climates at high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are typically violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Drapetes macrantha is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
