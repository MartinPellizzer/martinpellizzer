                    <h1>Disarrenum</h1>
<p>Disarrenum, commonly known as the yellow star grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Disarrenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, with a fibrous root system and a compact growth form.</p>
