<p>Dryopteris reticulata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its elongated, slender fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance due to their finely divided leaves. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender fronds compared to the typical form of D. reticulata.</p>
