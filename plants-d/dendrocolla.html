                    <h1>Dendrocolla</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that resemble a tree's canopy. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Dendrocolla thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid forests.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it can live for many decades, making it a symbol of longevity in botanical gardens.</p>
