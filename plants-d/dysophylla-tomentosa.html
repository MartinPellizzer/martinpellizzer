<p>Dysophylla tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dysophylla, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Dysophylla tomentosa is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
