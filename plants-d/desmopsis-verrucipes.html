                    <h1>Desmopsis verrucipes</h1>
<p>Desmopsis verrucipes, commonly known as the rough-skinned desert shrub, is a member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, rough, bark-like layer that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred shape, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
