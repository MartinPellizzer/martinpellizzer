<p>Delphinium palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves, which are lobed and resemble the shape of a hand, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
