<p>Didymoglossum wallii, commonly known as the wall's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
