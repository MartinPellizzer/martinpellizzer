<p>Dasiphora nitida, commonly known as the smooth fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Dasiphora nitida is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
