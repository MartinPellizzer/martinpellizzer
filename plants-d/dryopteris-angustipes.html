                    <h1>Dryopteris angustipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
