                    <h1>Drosera derbyensis</h1>
<p>Drosera derbyensis, commonly known as the Derby Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
