<p>Dendrobium erythrosema, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium erythrosema is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
