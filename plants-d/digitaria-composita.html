                    <h1>Digitaria composita</h1>
<p>Digitaria composita, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
<p>Digitaria composita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
