<p>Diplazium leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium leptophyllum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
