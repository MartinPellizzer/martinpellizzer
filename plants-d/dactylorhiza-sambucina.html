                <h1>Dactylorhiza sambucina</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza sambucina, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem arising from a pseudobulb-like structure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Dactylorhiza sambucina relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
