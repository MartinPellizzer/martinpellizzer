<p>Decachaena tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly decachaena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically forms a low-growing, mat-like structure with fleshy, cylindrical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in gardens and rockeries.</p>
