<p>Diaspis albida, commonly known as the white shield fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Diaspis albida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
