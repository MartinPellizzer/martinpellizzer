<p>Desmogymnosiphon chimeicus, commonly known as the Chimeic Ghost Fern, is a rare and elusive plant species found in the misty highlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions in the dim forest light. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on decaying tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
