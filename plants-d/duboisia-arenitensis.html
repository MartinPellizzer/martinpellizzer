                    <h1>Duboisia arenitensis</h1>
<p>Duboisia arenitensis, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
