<p>Dicymbe arenicola, commonly known as the sand dicymbe, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Dicymbe arenicola plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
