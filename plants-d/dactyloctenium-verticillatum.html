                    <h1>Dactyloctenium verticillatum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled grass or false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, whorled arrangement of leaves around the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
