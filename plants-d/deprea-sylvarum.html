                    <h1>Deprea sylvarum</h1>
<p>Deprea sylvarum, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the woodlands of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Deprea sylvarum thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in association with other woodland flora.</p>
