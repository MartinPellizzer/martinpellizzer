                    <h1>Deparia × angustata</h1>
<p>Deparia × angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Deparia × angustata contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability in various forest ecosystems.</p>
