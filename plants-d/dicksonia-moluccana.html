                    <h1>Dicksonia moluccana</h1>
<p>Dicksonia moluccana, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its growth and stores nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing cones, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating reproduction through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Dicksonia moluccana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
