<p>Dorycnium hirsutum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinctive ciliate edge. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by long, cylindrical pods containing several seeds.
