                    <h1>Dendrobium eburneum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium eburneum, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with red or purple veins.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
