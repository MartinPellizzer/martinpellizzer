                    <h1>Dryopteris amaiensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris amaiensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions.</p>
