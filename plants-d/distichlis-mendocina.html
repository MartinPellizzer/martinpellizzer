                    <h1>Distichlis mendocina</h1>
<p>Distichlis mendocina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Distichlis mendocina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
