<p>Davallia botrychioides, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a rosette shape resembling a bird's nest. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces new growth from the base, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
