<p>Dorstenia holstii, commonly known as the "Cape Cod plant," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the structure of a cactus, though it is not a true cactus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not closely related to the cacti family and has a different evolutionary lineage.</p>
