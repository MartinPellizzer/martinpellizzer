                    <h1>Drosera caduca</h1>
<p>Drosera caduca, commonly known as the summer beauty or the temporary sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant is notable for its ability to shed its leaves during dry periods, a trait that allows it to survive in arid environments. It blooms with small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Drosera caduca thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires specific conditions to maintain its unique carnivorous adaptations.</p>
