<p>Drimiopsis humifusa, commonly known as the dwarf drimiopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem system with fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Drimiopsis humifusa is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental foliage.</p>
