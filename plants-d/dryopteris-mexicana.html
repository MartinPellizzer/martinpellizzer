<p>Dryopteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
