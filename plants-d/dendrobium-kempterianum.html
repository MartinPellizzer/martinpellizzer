                    <h1>Dendrobium kempterianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium kempterianum, commonly known as the Kempterâ€™s orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Dendrobium kempterianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
