                    <h1>Dryopteris filix-mas var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris filix-mas var. abbreviata, commonly known as the compact male fern, is a variant of the male fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact fronds compared to the typical male fern, with a distinctive fiddlehead curl at the base. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the Dryopteris genus.</p>
