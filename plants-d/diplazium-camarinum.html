                <h1>Diplazium camarinum</h1>
<p>Diplazium camarinum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Diplazium camarinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
