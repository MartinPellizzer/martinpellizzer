                    <h1>Deschampsia alba</h1>
<p>Deschampsia alba, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-white hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Deschampsia alba is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
