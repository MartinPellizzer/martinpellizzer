The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a unique subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
