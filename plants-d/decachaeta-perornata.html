                    <h1>Decachaeta perornata</h1>
<p>Decachaeta perornata, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded, shrub-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Decachaeta perornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
