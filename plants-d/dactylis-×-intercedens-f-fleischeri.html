                    <h1>Dactylis × intercedens f. fleischeri</h1>
<p>Dactylis × intercedens f. fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
