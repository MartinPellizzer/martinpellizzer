<p>Dichanthelium xalapense var. strictirameum, commonly known as the narrow-ramal panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow leaves with a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
