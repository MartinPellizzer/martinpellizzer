                    <h1>Dunalia acaulis</h1>
<p>Dunalia acaulis, commonly known as the barren-stemmed dunalia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with no true stems, as the plant appears to grow directly from the ground. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often covered in a thick layer of wax to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
