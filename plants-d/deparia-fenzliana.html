                    <h1>Deparia fenzliana</h1>
<p>Deparia fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
