<p>Dryopteris kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western Ireland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a lush, shield-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.</p>
