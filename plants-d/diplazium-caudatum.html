<p>Diplazium caudatum, commonly known as the spurred brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, and often hairy fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium caudatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
