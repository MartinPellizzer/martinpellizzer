                    <h1>Dianthera paludosa</h1>
<p>Dianthera paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Dianthera paludosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
