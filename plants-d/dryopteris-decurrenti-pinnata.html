                    <h1>Dryopteris decurrenti-pinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris decurrenti-pinnata, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that have a decurrent (gradually tapering) shape, with pinnate (feather-like) divisions. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and adaptable nature.</p>
