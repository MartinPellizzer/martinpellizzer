                    <h1>Dupatya aciphylla</h1>
<p>Dupatya aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and relies on its hosts for water and nutrients, absorbing them through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
