                    <h1>Daphniphyllopsis</h1>
<p>Daphniphyllopsis, commonly known as the cycadeoid plant, is a genus of extinct seed plants that thrived during the Mesozoic era.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, fern-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure known as a megasporangium. They are considered relatives of cycads and ginkgoes, sharing some morphological similarities. Daphniphyllopsis fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating their prevalence in ancient swampy environments.</p>
<p>Their study provides important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleobotanical history of the Earth.</p>
