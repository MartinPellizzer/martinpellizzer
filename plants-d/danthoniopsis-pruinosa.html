<p>Danthoniopsis pruinosa, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Danthoniopsis pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
