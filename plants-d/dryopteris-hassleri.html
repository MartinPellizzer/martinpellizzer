<p>Dryopteris hassleri, commonly known as the Texas holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The fronds remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in the landscape.</p>
