<p>Digitaria sienitica, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
