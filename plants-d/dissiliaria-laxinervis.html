                    <h1>Dissiliaria laxinervis</h1>
<p>Dissiliaria laxinervis, commonly known as the slender-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
