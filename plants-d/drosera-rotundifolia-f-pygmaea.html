<p>Drosera rotundifolia f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf round-leaved sundew, is a variant of the common sundew.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant is native to acidic, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and heaths. Its diminutive size and specialized adaptations make it well-suited for its harsh environment.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
