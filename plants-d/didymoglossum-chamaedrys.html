<p>Didymoglossum chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of anthocyanins.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
