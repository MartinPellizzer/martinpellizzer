<p>Dortmanna pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, pyramidal structure with closely packed, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white rhizoids. It thrives in rocky or soil substrates and is often seen in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it plays a minor but ecologically important role in forest ecosystems.</p>
