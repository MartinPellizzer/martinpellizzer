<p>Dicoelospermum, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. These plants are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Dicoelospermum species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
