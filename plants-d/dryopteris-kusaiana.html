                    <h1>Dryopteris kusaiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris kusaiana, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months.</p>
