                    <h1>Dactylorchis majalis var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis majalis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and prefers moist, acidic soils. It is a rhizomatous orchid, meaning it spreads through underground stems, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Dactylorchis genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations.</p>
