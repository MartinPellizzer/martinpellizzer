<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
