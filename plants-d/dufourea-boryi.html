<p>Dufourea boryi, commonly known as the Bory's dwarf bee, is a small, solitary bee species belonging to the family Andrenidae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is typically found in grassy habitats and open areas with flowering plants. The plant associations of Dufourea boryi are closely tied to early-flowering plants such as clover and dandelions, which provide essential nectar and pollen resources. Its life cycle is closely synchronized with the blooming periods of these plants, ensuring a reliable food source for the species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Dufourea boryi is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed grassland ecosystems.</p>
