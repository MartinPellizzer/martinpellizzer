                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. collina</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. collina, commonly known as mountain grass or mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences that form small, rounded clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
