                    <h1>Dendrophthora terminalis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora terminalis, commonly known as the terminal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, affecting forest health.</p>
