                    <h1>Dryopteris stenophylla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent presence throughout the year.</p>
