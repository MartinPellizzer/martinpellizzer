<p>Disticholiparis cyclostele, commonly known as the cyclostele fern, is a unique member of the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that form a dense, circular crown. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy underground stem that supports its growth. Its leaves are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and function.</p>
<p>This ancient fern is often found in moist, shaded environments and is notable for its primitive reproductive features.</p>
