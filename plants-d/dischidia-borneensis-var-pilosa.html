<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
