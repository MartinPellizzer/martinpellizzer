                    <h1>Dryopteris microlepigera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris microlepigera, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are extensively branched and contribute to its ability to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
