The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the late afternoon. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Botanists study it to better understand its unique adaptations and conservation needs.</p>
