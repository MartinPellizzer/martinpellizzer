<p>Dicranopygium insulare, commonly known as the island moss, is a small, cushion-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant has a simple structure with short, branching stems and leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, translucent cells. It is typically found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the moss family.</p>
