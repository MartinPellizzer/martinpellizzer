<p>Damasonium vulgare, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the water's surface. It is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats that affect water flow and light penetration.</p>
<p>Damasonium vulgare is also known for its ability to tolerate moderate levels of pollution.</p>
