<p>Dicranopygium pachystemon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
