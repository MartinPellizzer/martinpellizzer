                    <h1>Draba eriopoda</h1>
<p>Draba eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Draba eriopoda is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, arid conditions and high-altitude habitats.</p>
