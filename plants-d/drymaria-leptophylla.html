                    <h1>Drymaria leptophylla</h1>
<p>Drymaria leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, opposite leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria leptophylla is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
