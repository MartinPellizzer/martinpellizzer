<p>Dioscorea villosa var. glabra, commonly known as wild yam, is a perennial vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, though the varietal form glabra has smoother, hairless foliage.

Its roots contain compounds like diosgenin, which are chemically similar to steroid hormones.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its traditional and potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
