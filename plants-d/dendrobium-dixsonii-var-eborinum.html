                    <h1>Dendrobium dixsonii var. eborinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium dixsonii var. eborinum, commonly known as the Eborinum Dendrobium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height, adorned with dense clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its flowers typically bloom during the cooler months, adding a unique ornamental value to its cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
