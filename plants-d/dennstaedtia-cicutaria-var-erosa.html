                    <h1>Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. erosa</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. erosa, commonly known as the erose fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The leaves are typically light green, with a soft texture and a distinctive erose margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through fragmentation.</p>
