                    <h1>Drosera echinoblastus</h1>
<p>Drosera echinoblastus, commonly known as the globular sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a tight cluster, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous habits, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
