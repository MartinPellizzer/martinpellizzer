<p>Dryopteris conversa, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, brownish layer of dead fronds, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Dryopteris conversa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
