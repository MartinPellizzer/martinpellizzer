                    <h1>Dysoxylum revolutum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum revolutum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Dysoxylum revolutum is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range.</p>
