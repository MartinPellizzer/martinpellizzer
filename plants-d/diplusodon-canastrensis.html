<p>Diplusodon canastrensis, commonly known as the Canastrenes palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry tropical environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaves, and it produces fruits that are edible but not widely consumed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
