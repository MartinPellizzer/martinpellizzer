                    <h1>Drymaria axillaris</h1>
<p>Drymaria axillaris, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria axillaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
