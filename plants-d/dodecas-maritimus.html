                    <h1>Dodecas maritimus</h1>
<p>Dodecas maritimus, commonly known as the sea dodeca, is a rare coastal plant that thrives in sandy or rocky shorelines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, helping it anchor in unstable coastal soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Dodecas maritimus is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
