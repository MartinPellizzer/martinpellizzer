                    <h1>Dryopteris gracilifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gracilifrons, commonly known as the slender-fringed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The slender-fringed wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
