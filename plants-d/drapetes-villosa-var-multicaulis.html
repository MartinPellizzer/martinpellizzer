<p>Drapetes villosa var. multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy drapetis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered foliage, which help it retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, adding to its ornamental value. Its botanical structure includes a short, fibrous root system and multiple stems that arise from the base, contributing to its unique growth form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
