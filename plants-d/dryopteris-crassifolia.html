                    <h1>Dryopteris crassifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
