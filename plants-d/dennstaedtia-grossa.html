<p>Dennstaedtia grossa, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture.</p>
