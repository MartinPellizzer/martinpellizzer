<p>Drosera natalensis, commonly known as Natal Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a mucilaginous substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, and is often found in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Drosera natalensis is a low-growing plant that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters.</p>
