                    <h1>Dactylorhiza aristata f. alba</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza aristata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture and acidic soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in association with other orchid species in similar environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
