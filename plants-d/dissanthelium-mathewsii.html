<p>Dissanthelium mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
