<p>Dendrobium pseudoconanthum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines.</p>

The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals, often resembling a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
