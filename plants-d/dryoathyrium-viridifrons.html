                    <h1>Dryoathyrium viridifrons</h1>
<p>Dryoathyrium viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronted fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
