                    <h1>Dendrophthora ramosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora ramosa, commonly known as the ramose mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and gelatinous berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
