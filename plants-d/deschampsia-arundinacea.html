<p>Deschampsia arundinacea, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble wheat spikes. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Silky wheatgrass is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
