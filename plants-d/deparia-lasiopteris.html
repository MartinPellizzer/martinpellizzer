<p>Deparia lasiopteris, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a dark green color with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
