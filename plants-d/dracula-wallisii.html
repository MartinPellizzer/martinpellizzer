                    <h1>Dracula wallisii</h1>
<p>Dracula wallisii, commonly known as the "Vampire Orchid," is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and elongated, fleshy stems that often bear clusters of small, intricate flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dracula wallisii is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
