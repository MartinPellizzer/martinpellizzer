                    <h1>Deparia × lobatocrenata</h1>
<p>Deparia × lobatocrenata, commonly known as the hybrid forest fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Deparia cuneata and Deparia lobata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
