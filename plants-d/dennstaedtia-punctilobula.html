                    <h1>Dennstaedtia punctilobula</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia punctilobula, commonly known as the fern with finely lobed fronds, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, and is often found growing on rocks or decaying wood.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of understory vegetation in eastern temperate forests.</p>
