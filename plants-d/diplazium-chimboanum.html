<p>Diplazium chimboanum, commonly known as the Chimboanum fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, triangular segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant to the forest floor, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium chimboanum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
