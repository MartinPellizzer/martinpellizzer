                    <h1>Dracophyllum ophioliticum</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum ophioliticum, commonly known as the ophiolite draco, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
