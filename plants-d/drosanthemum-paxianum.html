<p>Drosanthemum paxianum, commonly known as the wax plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.

<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
