<p>Dendrobium altomontanum, commonly known as the high mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height, often with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blooms are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals.</p>
<p>Dendrobium altomontanum thrives in humid, cool environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
