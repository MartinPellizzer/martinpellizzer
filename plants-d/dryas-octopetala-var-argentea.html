                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. argentea</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. argentea, commonly known as the silver-leaved mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subarctic regions of Europe and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-white, fuzzy leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
