                    <h1>Diplotropis incexis</h1>
<p>Diplotropis incexis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in woodland edges and dry habitats, and its seeds are dispersed by ants, a process known as myrmecochory.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
