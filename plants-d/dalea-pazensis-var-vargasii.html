                    <h1>Dalea pazensis var. vargasii</h1>
<p>Dalea pazensis var. vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, compound leaves and distinctive flower structure are adaptations to its harsh native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role in its ecosystem.</p>
