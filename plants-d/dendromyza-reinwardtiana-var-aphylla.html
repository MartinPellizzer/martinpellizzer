                    <h1>Dendromyza reinwardtiana var. aphylla</h1>
<p>Dendromyza reinwardtiana var. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless banyan, is a variant of the banyan tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves on the aerial roots, which distinguish it from other banyan species. The plant has a large, sprawling canopy supported by numerous prop roots that descend from its main trunk. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the branches.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ability to create dense shade in tropical environments.</p>
