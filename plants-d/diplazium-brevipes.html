<p>Diplazium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Diplazium brevipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
