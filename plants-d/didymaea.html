                    <h1>Didymaea</h1>
<p>Didymaea, commonly known as the "two-lobed grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Didymaea species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
