<p>Dryopteris supina, commonly known as the prostrate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of fronds. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and size. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fertile fronds.</p>
