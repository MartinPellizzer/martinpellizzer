<p>Drosera stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>rupicola, commonly known as the rock sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it reproduces both vegetatively through stolons and sexually via seeds.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
