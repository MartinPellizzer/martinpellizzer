                    <h1>Draba laevigata</h1>
<p>Draba laevigata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are basal, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Draba laevigata is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine gardens.</p>
