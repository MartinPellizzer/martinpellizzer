                    <h1>Danthonia spicata</h1>
<p>Danthonia spicata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological resilience.</p>
