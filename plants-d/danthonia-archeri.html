<p>Danthonia archeri, commonly known as the mountain grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions.</p>
<p>Danthonia archeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
