<p>Desmoncus kaieteurensis, commonly known as the Kaieteurean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical forests of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Terminalia and Combretaceae species. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing some ecological benefits through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
