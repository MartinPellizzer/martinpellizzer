                <h1>Distichlis scoparia</h1>
<p>Distichlis scoparia, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of coastal dune stabilization. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments contributes to its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Distichlis scoparia is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
