                    <h1>Dryopteris sukungiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sukungiana, commonly known as the Sukung Island wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
