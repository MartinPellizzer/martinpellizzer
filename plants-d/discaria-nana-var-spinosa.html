<p>Discaria nana var. spinosa, commonly known as the prickly burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>
