<p>Distichorchis siberutensis, commonly known as the Siberut orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the islands of Siberut in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, linear leaves are adapted to conserve moisture, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence with multiple blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
