                    <h1>Dendrobium paniculatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium paniculatum, commonly known as the orchid of the forest, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients for the plant.</p>
<p>Dendrobium paniculatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
