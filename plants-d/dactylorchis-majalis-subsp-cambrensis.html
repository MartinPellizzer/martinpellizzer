<p>Dactylorchis majalis subsp.</p>
<p>cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wetlands of Wales. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its symbiotic relationship with soil microorganisms. It thrives in damp, nutrient-poor habitats such as peat bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
