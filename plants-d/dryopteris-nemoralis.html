                    <h1>Dryopteris nemoralis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland shield fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Dryopteris nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
