                    <h1>Dryopteris hendersonii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a complex and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, fleshy sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
