                    <h1>Dryandra calophylla var. acaulis</h1>
<p>Dryandra calophylla var. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless dryandra, is a unique variant of the dryandra species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves emerging directly from the base, forming a dense, low-growing mound. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in native gardens and conservation areas.</p>
