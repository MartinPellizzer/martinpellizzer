<p>Dryadella silvana, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive silver-gray upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a complex interplay between fungal and algal components. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
