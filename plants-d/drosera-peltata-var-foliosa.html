<p>Drosera peltata var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in sticky glands, which trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect prey. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pinkish flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to moist, acidic soils.</p>
