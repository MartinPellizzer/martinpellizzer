                    <h1>Deparia pseudoconilii var. pseudoconilii</h1>
<p>Deparia pseudoconilii var. pseudoconilii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30–60 cm in length. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with densely packed, dimorphic fronds—sterile and fertile—arranged in a compact rosette. Its spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests.</p>
