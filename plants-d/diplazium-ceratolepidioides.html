                    <h1>Diplazium ceratolepidioides</h1>
<p>Diplazium ceratolepidioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
