                    <h1>Drosera glabriscapa</h1>
<p>Drosera glabriscapa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
