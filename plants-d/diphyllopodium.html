<p>Diphyllopodium, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottsiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, flattened structure and the presence of rhizoids, which anchor it to surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has specialized structures for absorbing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Diphyllopodium reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules found on the plant's surface.</p>
