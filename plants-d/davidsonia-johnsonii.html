                    <h1>Davidsonia johnsonii</h1>
<p>Davidsonia johnsonii, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. Davidsonia johnsonii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
