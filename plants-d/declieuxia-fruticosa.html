<p>Declieuxia fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a shrub-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Declieuxia fruticosa is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
