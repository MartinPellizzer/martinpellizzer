                    <h1>Deparia sichuanensis var. sichuanensis</h1>
<p>Deparia sichuanensis var. sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan wood fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the soil while supporting its growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
