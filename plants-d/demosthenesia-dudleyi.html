                    <h1>Demosthenesia dudleyi</h1>
<p>Demosthenesia dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom during the evening, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to thrive in extreme desert conditions. Its botanical classification places it within the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Demosthenesia dudleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
