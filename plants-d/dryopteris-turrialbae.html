<p>Dryopteris turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and humid woodlands. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
