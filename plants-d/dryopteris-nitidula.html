                    <h1>Dryopteris nitidula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nitidula, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright,丛生 growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps the plant retain moisture in its woodland habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
