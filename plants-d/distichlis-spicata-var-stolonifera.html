                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. stolonifera, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that are typically bluish-green in color. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
