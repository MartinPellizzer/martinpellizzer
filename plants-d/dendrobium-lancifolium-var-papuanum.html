                    <h1>Dendrobium lancifolium var. papuanum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium lancifolium var. papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
