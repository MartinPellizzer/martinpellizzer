<p>Dicoma sessiliflora, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Dicoma sessiliflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
