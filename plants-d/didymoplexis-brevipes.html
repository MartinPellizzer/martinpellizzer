<p>Didymoplexis brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually small and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences with a distinctive, spurred shape.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Didymoplexis brevipes is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
