                    <h1>Diflugossa nagaensis</h1>
<p>Diflugossa nagaensis, commonly known as the Naga mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of northeastern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
