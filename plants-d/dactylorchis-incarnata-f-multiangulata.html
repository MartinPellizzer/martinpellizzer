<p>Dactylorchis incarnata f. multiangulata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
