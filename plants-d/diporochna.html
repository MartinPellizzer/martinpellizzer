                    <h1>Diporochna</h1>
<p>Diporochna, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Diporochna plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
