                    <h1>Dryopteris verruculosa var. sumatrana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris verruculosa var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, raised spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and may develop a reddish hue when young, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
