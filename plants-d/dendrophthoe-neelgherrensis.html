                    <h1>Dendrophthoe neelgherrensis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe neelgherrensis, commonly known as the Neelgherrensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the forests of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries that aid in seed dispersal by birds. The plant lacks true leaves and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis through its green stems.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
