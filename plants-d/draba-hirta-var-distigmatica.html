<p>Draba hirta var. distigmatica, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine plantings.</p>
