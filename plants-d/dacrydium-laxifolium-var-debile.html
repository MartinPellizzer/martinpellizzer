<p>Dacrydium laxifolium var. debile, commonly known as the slender-leaved silver pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in subalpine or montane regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
