<p>Delilia repens, commonly known as the creeping delilia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Delilia repens is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
