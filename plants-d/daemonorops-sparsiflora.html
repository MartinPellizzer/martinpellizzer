                    <h1>Daemonorops sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Daemonorops sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate, feather-like leaves that are dark green and often glossy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female cones, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
