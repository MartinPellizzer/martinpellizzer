<p>Dryopteris arbuscula, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
