<p>Darea bifida, commonly known as the splitleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed or split, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its flowers are yellow and form a single bloom at the top of the stem, followed by a distinctive crown of bracts that resemble a clock.</p>
<p>Darea bifida is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
