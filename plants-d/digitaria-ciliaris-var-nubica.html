<p>Digitaria ciliaris var. nubica, commonly known as Nubian fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>This species is often used for forage in livestock grazing systems due to its hardiness and nutritional value.</p>
