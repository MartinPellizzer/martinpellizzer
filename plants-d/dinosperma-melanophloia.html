<p>Dinosperma melanophloia, commonly known as the black phloem desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources, which contributes to its survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Dinosperma melanophloia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
