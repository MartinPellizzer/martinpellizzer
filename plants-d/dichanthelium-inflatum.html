<p>Dichanthelium inflatum, commonly known as the inflated grass or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, membranous pods that aid in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Dichanthelium inflatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
