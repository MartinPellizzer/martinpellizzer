                    <h1>Dictyocaryum</h1>
<p>Dictyocaryum, commonly known as the "skeleton fern," is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically narrow and have a feathery appearance, with a distinctive, segmented structure. Dictyocaryum species often grow in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
