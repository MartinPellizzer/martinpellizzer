<p>Dryopteris palustris var. uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay marsh fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in wet, boggy environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist, acidic soils and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
