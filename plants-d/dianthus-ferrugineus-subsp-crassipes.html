<p>Dianthus ferrugineus subsp.</p>
<p>crassipes, commonly known as the rough pinks or rock pinks, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with prominent, fringed petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
