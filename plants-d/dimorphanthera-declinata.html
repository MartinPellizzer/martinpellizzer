                    <h1>Dimorphanthera declinata</h1>
<p>Dimorphanthera declinata, commonly known as the declining dimorphanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Dimorphanthera declinata plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
