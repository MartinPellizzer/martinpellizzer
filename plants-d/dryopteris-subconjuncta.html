<p>Dryopteris subconjuncta, commonly known as the crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that often have a curled or crested appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
