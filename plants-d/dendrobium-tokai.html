                    <h1>Dendrobium tokai</h1>
<p>Dendrobium tokai, commonly known as the Tokai orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium tokai is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
