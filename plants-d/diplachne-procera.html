<p>Diplachne procera, commonly known as the giant flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Diplachne procera thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
