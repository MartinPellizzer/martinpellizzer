                    <h1>Dryopteris enneaphylla var. toyamae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris enneaphylla var. toyamae, commonly known as the Toyama wood fern, is a variant of the nine-pinnate wood fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant features a fertile frond with sporangia arranged in clusters along the pinnae, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
