                    <h1>Dryopteris blanda</h1>
<p>Dryopteris blanda, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, upright, spore-bearing cones called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
