<p>Dryopteris eriosorus, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of dark green, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, round sporangia found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
