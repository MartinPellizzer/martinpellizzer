<p>Drosera communis var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a dense cluster and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and compact growth habit compared to other Drosera species.</p>
