<p>Daphne composita var. montana, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the foliage remains attractive throughout the colder months.</p>
