                    <h1>Draba alpina var. leiophylla</h1>
<p>Draba alpina var. leiophylla, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, yellow or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, featuring a compact growth form to minimize heat loss and withstand strong winds. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, aiding in water retention in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, leathery leaves, which set it apart from other Draba species.</p>
