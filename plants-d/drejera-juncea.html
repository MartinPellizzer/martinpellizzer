                    <h1>Drejera juncea</h1>
<p>Drejera juncea, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Drejera juncea plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its ecological significance is less studied compared to other milkweed species.</p>
