                    <h1>Desmodium griffithianum var. leiocarpum</h1>
<p>Desmodium griffithianum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the silky desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, smooth, and often clustered seed pods, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry and soil enrichment practices.</p>
