<p>Dupatya dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that split into two main branches, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
