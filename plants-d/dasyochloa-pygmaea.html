                    <h1>Dasyochloa pygmaea</h1>
<p>Dasyochloa pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to form dense mats, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
