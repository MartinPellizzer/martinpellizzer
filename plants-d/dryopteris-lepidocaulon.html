                    <h1>Dryopteris lepidocaulon</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lepidocaulon, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, scale-like trichomes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
