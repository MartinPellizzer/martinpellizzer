                    <h1>Dendrophthoe cordifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf ghost orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb nutrients from host trees. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its unique morphology and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas.</p>
