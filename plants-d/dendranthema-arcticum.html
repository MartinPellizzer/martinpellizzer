                    <h1>Dendranthema arcticum</h1>
<p>Dendranthema arcticum, commonly known as Arctic chamomile, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flower heads surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, resembling those of chamomile. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Dendranthema arcticum plays a role in pollination and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
