<p>Douglasdeweya wangii, commonly known as the Wangii Douglas-fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces distinctive cones that are often reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
