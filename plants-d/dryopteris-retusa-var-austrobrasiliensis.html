                    <h1>Dryopteris retusa var. austrobrasiliensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris retusa var. austrobrasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sword fern, is a fern species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often silvery-green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
