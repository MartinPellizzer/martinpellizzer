                    <h1>Dryopteris pedata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pedata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
