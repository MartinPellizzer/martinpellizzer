                    <h1>Dryopteris punctata var. rugosula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris punctata var. rugosula, commonly known as the rough serrated wood fern, is a variant of the serrated wood fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
