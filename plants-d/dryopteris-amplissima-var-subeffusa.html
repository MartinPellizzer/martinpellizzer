                    <h1>Dryopteris amplissima var. subeffusa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris amplissima var. subeffusa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinct rows on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
