                    <h1>Diplecthrum cuculliflorum</h1>
<p>Diplecthrum cuculliflorum, commonly known as the hooded waterflag, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes and produce floating or submerged leaves. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its unique, hood-like inflorescence, which consists of small, greenish-white flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
