                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. pitcairnensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. pitcairnensis, commonly known as the Pitcairn fern, is a rare and unique variety of the common sword fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. This fern is native to the remote Pitcairn Islands and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
