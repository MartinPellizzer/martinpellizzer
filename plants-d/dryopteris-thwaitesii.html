<p>Dryopteris thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate woodlands.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
