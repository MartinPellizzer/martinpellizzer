<p>Dacrycarpus imbricatus var. imbricatus, commonly known as the coastal or beach kauri, is a species of coniferous tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
