<p>Dorstenia crispata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by distinctive, spiral-shaped fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Dorstenia crispata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
