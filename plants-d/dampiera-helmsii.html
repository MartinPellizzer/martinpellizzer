                    <h1>Dampiera helmsii</h1>
<p>Dampiera helmsii, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal damper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dampiera helmsii is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
