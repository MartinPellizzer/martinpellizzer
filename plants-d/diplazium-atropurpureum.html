                    <h1>Diplazium atropurpureum</h1>
<p>Diplazium atropurpureum, commonly known as purple fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark purple or reddish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in moist soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
