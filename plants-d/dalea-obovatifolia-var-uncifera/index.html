This variant is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking pink to purple flowers. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh conditions. Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
