                    <h1>Didymophysa fenestrata</h1>
<p>Didymophysa fenestrata, commonly known as the fenestrated didymophysa, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fenestrated (windowed) leaves that create an intricate pattern of holes and lobes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, dark green foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces dark blue or black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Didymophysa fenestrata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
