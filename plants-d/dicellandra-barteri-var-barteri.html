<p>Dicellandra barteri var. barteri, commonly known as the Barter's dicellandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
