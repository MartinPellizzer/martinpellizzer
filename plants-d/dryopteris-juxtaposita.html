<p>Dryopteris juxtaposita, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
