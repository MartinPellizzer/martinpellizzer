                    <h1>Dendrobium indivisum var. pallidum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium indivisum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive pale lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the diverse orchid flora of its native habitat.</p>
