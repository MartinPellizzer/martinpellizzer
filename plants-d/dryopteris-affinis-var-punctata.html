<p>Dryopteris affinis var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive frond structure with a short, thick rhizome and bi-lobed, pinnately compound leaves. The fronds are typically dark green with a grayish or brownish underside, and the spore-bearing structures are clustered in sori along the veins. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
