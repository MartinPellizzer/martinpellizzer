<p>Dryopteris × complexa subsp.</p>
<p>inconspicua, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically 30–60 cm in length.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
