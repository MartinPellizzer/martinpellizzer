                    <h1>Dendrobium petri</h1>
<p>Dendrobium petri, commonly known as the petri orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Dendrobium petri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in both gardens and greenhouses.</p>
