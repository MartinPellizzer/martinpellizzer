                    <h1>Davallia grammatosora</h1>
<p>Davallia grammatosora, commonly known as the feather-leaf hakea, is a rare and delicate fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
