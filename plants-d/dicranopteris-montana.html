<p>Dicranopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year being a sterile spore-bearing structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
