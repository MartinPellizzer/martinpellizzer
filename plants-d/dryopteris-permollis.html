                <h1>Dryopteris permollis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris permollis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the winter to conserve energy, and regrow in the spring.</p>
