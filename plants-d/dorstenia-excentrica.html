<p>Dorstenia excentrica, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems that twist and turn in a zigzag pattern, which helps it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Dorstenia excentrica is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
