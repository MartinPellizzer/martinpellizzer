                    <h1>Dryopteris biaurita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris biaurita, commonly known as the two-auricled wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with two auriculae, or ear-like lobes, at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of fronds that can reach up to 60 cm in length.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
