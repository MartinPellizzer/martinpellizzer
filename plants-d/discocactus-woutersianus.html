<p>Discocactus woutersianus, commonly known as the Wouters' discocactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate beauty to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
