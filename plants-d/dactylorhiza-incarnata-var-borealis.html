<p>Dactylorhiza incarnata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in wet, boggy habitats. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous small, violet to pinkish-purple flowers. Its flowers are spurred, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to cold, temperate climates and is often found in peat bogs and wet meadows.</p>
