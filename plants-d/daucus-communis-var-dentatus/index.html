                            <h1>Daucus Communis Var. Dentatus</h1>
<p>Wild carrot, scientifically known as Daucus communis var. dentatus, is a hardy and often overlooked member of the Apiaceae family. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in disturbed soils and open landscapes. Though similar in appearance to its domesticated cousin, the cultivated carrot, it possesses a distinct, more rugged foliage and a slightly bitter taste. This plant is often mistaken for poison hemlock, highlighting the importance of accurate identification. Despite its potential for confusion, wild carrot plays a vital ecological role as a food source for various insects and wildlife.</p>
