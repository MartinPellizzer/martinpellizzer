                    <h1>Diplotaxis saharensis</h1>
<p>Diplotaxis saharensis, commonly known as the Saharan mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard species, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
