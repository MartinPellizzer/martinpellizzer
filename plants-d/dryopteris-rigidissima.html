                    <h1>Dryopteris rigidissima</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rigidissima, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are dark green and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
