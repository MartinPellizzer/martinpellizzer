<p>Dentimetula, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, tooth-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Dentimetula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
