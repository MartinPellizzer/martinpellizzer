<p>Dryopteris lagerheimii, commonly known as the Hairy Wood Fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
