                    <h1>Dionaea corymbosa</h1>
<p>Dionaea corymbosa, commonly known as the sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs capable of trapping insects. The plant's leaves curl around prey to aid in digestion, using enzymes to break down the captured organisms. Dionaea corymbosa thrives in nutrient-poor environments, supplementing its diet with the nutrients obtained from its prey.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and ecology.</p>
