                    <h1>Danthonia thuarii</h1>
<p>Danthonia thuarii, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in coastal restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in landscaped areas.</p>
