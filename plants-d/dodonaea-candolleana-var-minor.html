                    <h1>Dodonaea candolleana var. minor</h1>
<p>Dodonaea candolleana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser candlebush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are dry, woody capsules that split open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
