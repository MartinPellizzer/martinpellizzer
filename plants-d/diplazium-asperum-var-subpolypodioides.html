                    <h1>Diplazium asperum var. subpolypodioides</h1>
<p>Diplazium asperum var. subpolypodioides, commonly known as the rough serrate fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved water fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, creeping rhizomes and large, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its adaptability and is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
