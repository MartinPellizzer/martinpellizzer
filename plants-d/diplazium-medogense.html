<p>Diplazium medogense, commonly known as the Medog spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Diplazium medogense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
