<p>Dennstaedtia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across water surfaces. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
