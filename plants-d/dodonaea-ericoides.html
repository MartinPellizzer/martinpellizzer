                    <h1>Dodonaea ericoides</h1>
<p>Dodonaea ericoides, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its woody stems are often covered in a sticky resin, which can make it challenging to handle.</p>
<p>Dodonaea ericoides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
