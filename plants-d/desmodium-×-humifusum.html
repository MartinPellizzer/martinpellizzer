                    <h1>Desmodium × humifusum</h1>
<p>Desmodium × humifusum, commonly known as the creeping sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
