<p>Dalbergia heptaphylla, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
