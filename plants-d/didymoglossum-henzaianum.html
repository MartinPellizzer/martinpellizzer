                    <h1>Didymoglossum henzaianum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum henzaianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog moss, is a small, evergreen moss that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often curved or rolled. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and has a low profile, making it well adapted to its moist, often nutrient-poor habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of peatland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and carbon sequestration.</p>
