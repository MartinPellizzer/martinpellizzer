<p>Dendrobium suavicans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium suavicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
