                    <h1>Didymoglossum crispulum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum crispulum, commonly known as the curly-leaved moss, is a small, creeping moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. Its structure is simple, with no true stems or leaves in the traditional sense, but rather a thallus composed of leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum crispulum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
