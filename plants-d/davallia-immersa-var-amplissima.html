<p>Davallia immersa var. amplissima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant.</p>
