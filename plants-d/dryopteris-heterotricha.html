                    <h1>Dryopteris heterotricha</h1>
<p>Dryopteris heterotricha, commonly known as the heterotrichous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two distinct types of pinnaeâ€”some with a single vein and others with multiple veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
