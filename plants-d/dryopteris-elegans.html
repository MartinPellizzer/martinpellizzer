                    <h1>Dryopteris elegans</h1>
<p>Dryopteris elegans, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a refined appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
