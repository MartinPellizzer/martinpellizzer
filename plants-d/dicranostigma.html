<p>Dicranostigma, commonly known as the rock rose or desert rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species that are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have succulent stems and leaves, which help them conserve water in their natural habitats. They produce showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Dicranostigma species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
