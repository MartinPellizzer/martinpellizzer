                    <h1>Dryopteris grisea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris grisea, commonly known as the gray wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a grayish or silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months.</p>
