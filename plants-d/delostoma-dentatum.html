                    <h1>Delostoma dentatum</h1>
<p>Delostoma dentatum, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in tiny, tooth-like projections. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. It typically inhabits still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Delostoma dentatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
