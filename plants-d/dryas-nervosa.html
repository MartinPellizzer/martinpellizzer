                    <h1>Dryas nervosa</h1>
<p>Dryas nervosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to insulate the plant in cold environments.</p>
<p>Dryas nervosa is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
