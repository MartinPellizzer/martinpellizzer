                    <h1>Dupatya helminthorhiza</h1>
<p>Dupatya helminthorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white floral structure, which lacks the typical showy petals seen in many orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dupatya helminthorhiza is considered critically endangered.</p>
