<p>Dampiera linearis f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated dampiera, is a variant of the native Australian plant Dampiera linearis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>The elongated form of its leaves distinguishes this fasciation from the typical form of the species.</p>
