                    <h1>Diplazium sibuyanense</h1>
<p>Diplazium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan spleenwort, is a fern native to the Philippines, particularly found on the island of Sibuyan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
