<p>Disocactus × splendens, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that bear clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant produces its flowers during the spring and early summer, often around Easter, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Disocactus × splendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
