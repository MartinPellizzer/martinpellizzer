                    <h1>Dryopteris insularis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris insularis, commonly known as the island wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
