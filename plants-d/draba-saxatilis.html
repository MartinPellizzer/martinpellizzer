<p>Draba saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>

Native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in harsh habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
