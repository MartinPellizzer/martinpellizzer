                    <h1>Dryopteris subsimilis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subsimilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that becomes more refined as the plant matures. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded, moist environments.</p>
