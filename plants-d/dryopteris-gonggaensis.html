                    <h1>Dryopteris gonggaensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gonggaensis, commonly known as the Gongga Brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution.</p>
