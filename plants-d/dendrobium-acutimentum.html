<p>Dendrobium acutimentum, commonly known as the sharp-angled dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow lips. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged along the pseudobulbs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Dendrobium acutimentum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
