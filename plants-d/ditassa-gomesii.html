                    <h1>Ditassa gomesii</h1>
<p>Ditassa gomesii, commonly known as the Gomesii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
