                    <h1>Dierbachia ramiflora</h1>
<p>Dierbachia ramiflora, commonly known as the flaxleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its tropical environment. Dierbachia ramiflora produces cones instead of flowers, with the male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This plant is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
