                    <h1>Drosera gibsonii</h1>
<p>Drosera gibsonii, commonly known as Gibson's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
