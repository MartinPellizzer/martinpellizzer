                    <h1>Dolichlasium lagascae</h1>
<p>Dolichlasium lagascae, commonly known as the Madagascar spider orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dolichlasium lagascae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
