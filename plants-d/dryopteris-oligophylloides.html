                    <h1>Dryopteris oligophylloides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oligophylloides, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorangia.</p>
