<p>Dipteracanthus geminiflorus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twin-flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a short, herbaceous stem and a unique flowering pattern that distinguishes it from other members of the family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
