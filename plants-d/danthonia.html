                    <h1>Danthonia</h1>
<p>Danthonia, commonly known as hairgrass, is a genus of perennial grasses belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fine, hair-like leaves and are often found in moist, acidic soils. Danthonia species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, making them common in wetlands and grassy areas. They are well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in regions with cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
