<p>Dendrobium baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light.</p>
<p>Dendrobium baileyi is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
