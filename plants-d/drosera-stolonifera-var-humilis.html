                    <h1>Drosera stolonifera var. humilis</h1>
<p>Drosera stolonifera var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a low-growing carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, sticky glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically forms dense mats by producing stolons, which root at the nodes and create new rosettes. Its flowers are small and usually pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth.</p>
