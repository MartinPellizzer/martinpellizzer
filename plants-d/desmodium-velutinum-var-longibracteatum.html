<p>Desmodium velutinum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its hairy stems and leaves give it a velvety appearance. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings.</p>
