                            <h1>Doritis Chibae</h1>
<p>Chibae's doritis, scientifically known as Doritis chibae, is a rare and striking member of the Doritidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique foliage features vibrant, velvety leaves with intricate patterns that shimmer in the light. Often mistaken for a decorative succulent, it requires specific care to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
