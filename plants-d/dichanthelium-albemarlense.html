<p>Dichanthelium albemarlense, commonly known as the whiteleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
