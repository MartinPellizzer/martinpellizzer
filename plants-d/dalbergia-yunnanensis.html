<p>Dalbergia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
