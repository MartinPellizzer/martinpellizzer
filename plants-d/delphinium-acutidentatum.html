<p>Delphinium acutidentatum, commonly known as the sharp-toothed larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Delphinium acutidentatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>
