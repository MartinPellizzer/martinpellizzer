                    <h1>Diphragmus</h1>
<p>Diphragmus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They have thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, making them drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Diphragmus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
