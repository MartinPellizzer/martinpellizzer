<p>Danthonia semiannularis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender danthonia, is a grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
