                    <h1>Draconia commutata</h1>
<p>Draconia commutata, commonly known as the dragon's tongue plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Draconia commutata is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and modest floral display.</p>
