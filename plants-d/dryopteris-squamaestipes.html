                    <h1>Dryopteris squamaestipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris squamaestipes, commonly known as the scaly shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of brown, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
