<p>Distephanus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that help in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
