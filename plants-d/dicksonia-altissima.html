                    <h1>Dicksonia altissima</h1>
<p>Dicksonia altissima, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It reproduces through spores released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Dicksonia altissima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
