<p>Diplocaulobium cervicaliferum, commonly known as the neck-bearing fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a distinctive neck-like structure on its fronds, which is a defining trait of the genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
