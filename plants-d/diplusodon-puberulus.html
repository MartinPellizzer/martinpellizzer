                    <h1>Diplusodon puberulus</h1>
<p>Diplusodon puberulus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
