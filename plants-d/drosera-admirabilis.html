                    <h1>Drosera admirabilis</h1>
<p>Drosera admirabilis, commonly known as the marvel pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hirsute, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, inflorescent stems with clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
