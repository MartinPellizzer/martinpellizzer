<p>Digitaria subhorizontalis, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three bracts. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Digitaria subhorizontalis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
