<p>Dactylis paucinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with few prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Dactylis paucinervis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
