                    <h1>Donkelaaria</h1>
<p>Donkelaaria, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria. Donkelaaria typically grows on bare rock surfaces, stone walls, and tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its slow growth rate makes it an indicator of environmental conditions and air quality.</p>
<p>The plant's simple structure and ability to survive in harsh conditions contribute to its ecological importance in rocky habitats.</p>
