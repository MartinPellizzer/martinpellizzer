                    <h1>Delphinium pycnocentroides</h1>
<p>Delphinium pycnocentroides, commonly known as the dense-centered larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which give the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Delphinium pycnocentroides is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content.</p>
