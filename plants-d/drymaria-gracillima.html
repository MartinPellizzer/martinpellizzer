                    <h1>Drymaria gracillima</h1>
<p>Drymaria gracillima, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Drymaria gracillima is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
