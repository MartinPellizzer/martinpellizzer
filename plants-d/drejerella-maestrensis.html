<p>Drejerella maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks.</p>
