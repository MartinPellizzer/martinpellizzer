                    <h1>Dendrophthora versicolor</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora versicolor, commonly known as the variable wood parasite, is a fungal plant that primarily infects hardwood trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce a variety of fruiting bodies with different colors, ranging from white to yellow and red. The fungus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on the trunks and branches of its host trees. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the trees it infects.</p>
