<p>Dicksonia sorbifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant's fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps it attract pollinators in the dark. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Dicksonia sorbifolia plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems.</p>
