<p>Desmodium alysicarpoides, commonly known as the sicklepod or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to distinctive, sickle-shaped pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility.</p>
