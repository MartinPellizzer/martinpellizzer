                    <h1>Dioon edule var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Dioon edule var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the dry forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
