<p>Dimorphorchis rossii var. tenomensis, commonly known as the Tenom orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
