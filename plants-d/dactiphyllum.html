                    <h1>Dactiphyllum</h1>
<p>Dactiphyllum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dactiphyllum is native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for coastal ecosystems and xerophytic habitats.</p>
