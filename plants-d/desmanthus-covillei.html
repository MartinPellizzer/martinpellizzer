<p>Desmanthus covillei, commonly known as Coville's burr legume, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Coville's burr legume is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and improving soil health through nitrogen fixation.</p>
