                    <h1>Dryopteris remotipinnula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris remotipinnula, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread gradually through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
