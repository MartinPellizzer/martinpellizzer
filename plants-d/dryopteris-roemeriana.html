                    <h1>Dryopteris roemeriana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris roemeriana, commonly known as the roemer's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
