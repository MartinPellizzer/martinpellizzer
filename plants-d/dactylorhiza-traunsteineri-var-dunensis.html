                    <h1>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. dunensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. dunensis, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish or brownish flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in acidic, moist habitats such as peat bogs and pine forests. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
