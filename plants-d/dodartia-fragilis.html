                    <h1>Dodartia fragilis</h1>
<p>Dodartia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, leaves, and stems.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is rarely seen in the wild and is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
