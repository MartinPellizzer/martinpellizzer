                    <h1>Davallia rhomboidea</h1>
<p>Davallia rhomboidea, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped fronds and a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread gradually. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
