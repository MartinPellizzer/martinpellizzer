                    <h1>Dryopteris aciculata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aciculata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris aciculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
