                    <h1>Dryopteris calcarea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris calcarea, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Dryopteris calcarea is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
