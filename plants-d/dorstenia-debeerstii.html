                    <h1>Dorstenia debeerstii</h1>
<p>Dorstenia debeerstii, commonly known as the "Cushion Dorstenia," is a unique member of the Moraceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Dorstenia debeerstii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
