<p>Dichostylis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf dichostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is characterized by its two distinct styles in its flowers, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited size and specific habitat, it is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
