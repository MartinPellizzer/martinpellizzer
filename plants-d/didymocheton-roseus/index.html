                            <h1>Didymocheton Roseus</h1>
<p>Rose apple, scientifically known as Didymocheton roseus, is a tropical fruit tree native to Southeast Asia. It is prized for its sweet, fragrant fruit that resembles a small apple in appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible yield. Its leaves are broad and glossy, while its flowers are pale yellow with a distinctive rose-like scent. Despite its name, the rose apple is not closely related to the rose or the apple, making it a unique botanical curiosity.</p>
