                    <h1>Desmodium oxalidifolium</h1>
<p>Desmodium oxalidifolium, commonly known as the kidneyleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble the shape of a kidney, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable plant in native gardens.</p>
