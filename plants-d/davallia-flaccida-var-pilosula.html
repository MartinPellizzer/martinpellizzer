                    <h1>Davallia flaccida var. pilosula</h1>
<p>Davallia flaccida var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The varietal form pilosula distinguishes it from the typical Davallia flaccida by its more pronounced hairy covering on the fronds.</p>
