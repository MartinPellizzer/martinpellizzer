                    <h1>Doryopteris raddiana var. patula</h1>
<p>Doryopteris raddiana var. patula, commonly known as the Patula fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with broad, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
