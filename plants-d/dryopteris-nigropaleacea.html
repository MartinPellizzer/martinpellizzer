<p>Dryopteris nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive dark, almost black venation on its fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex, feather-like structure that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorus.</p>
