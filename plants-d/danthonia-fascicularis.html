                    <h1>Danthonia fascicularis</h1>
<p>Danthonia fascicularis, commonly known as the tufted grass or dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is occasionally cultivated in aquatic and wetland gardens.</p>
