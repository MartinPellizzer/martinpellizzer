                    <h1>Dichanthelium leucoblepharis</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium leucoblepharis, commonly known as the white-eyed panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinctive white or pale-colored lemma, which gives it its common name.</p>
