                    <h1>Dactylorhiza incarnata var. dunensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza incarnata var. dunensis, commonly known as the Scottish bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Scotland and northern England.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs and damp grasslands, thriving in shaded environments. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in late spring, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet, muddy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is considered rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
