<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola subsp.</p>
<p>deweveri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to peat bogs in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate for successful growth. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding peat, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
