                    <h1>Dendrophthora moniliformis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora moniliformis, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that primarily infests dead wood in temperate and tropical forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, with a white to pale yellow cap and a slender, branching stipe. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on fallen trees or stumps.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora moniliformis is not parasitic but contributes to the breakdown of organic matter, supporting the health of forest soils.</p>
