<p>Dicalix yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan dicalix, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dicalix yunnanensis is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
