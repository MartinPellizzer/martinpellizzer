                    <h1>Dendrobium calamiforme</h1>
<p>Dendrobium calamiforme, commonly known as the sickle-shaped orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct, fragrant scent. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium calamiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure.</p>
