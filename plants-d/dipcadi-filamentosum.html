                    <h1>Dipcadi filamentosum</h1>
<p>Dipcadi filamentosum, commonly known as the filamentous broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration. Its roots are highly specialized, forming haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions.</p>
