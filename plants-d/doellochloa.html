                    <h1>Doellochloa</h1>
<p>Doellochloa, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a genus of grasses native to Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Doellochloa species are generally low-growing, with a clumping growth habit, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>These grasses play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native environments.</p>
