                    <h1>Davallia moritziana</h1>
<p>Davallia moritziana, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
