                    <h1>Dorstenia capricorniana</h1>
<p>Dorstenia capricorniana, commonly known as the "capricornian spiderwort," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the horns of the constellation Capricorn.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, often mistaken for leaves due to their subtle appearance. The plant is known for its ability to climb using tendrils, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, Dorstenia capricorniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and resilience in certain growing conditions.</p>
