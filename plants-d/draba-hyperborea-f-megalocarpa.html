                    <h1>Draba hyperborea f. megalocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba hyperborea f. megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant-seeded rockcress, is a rare and robust flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its most distinctive feature is its large, fleshy seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological resilience and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
