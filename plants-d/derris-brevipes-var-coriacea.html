                    <h1>Derris brevipes var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Derris brevipes var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-seeded derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, spiny pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The rough texture of its bark and seeds gives it its scientific variety name, *coriacea*, meaning "rough" in Latin.</p>
