                    <h1>Dalbergia penduliflora</h1>
<p>Dalbergia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flowered ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is not as commercially significant as other Dalbergia species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
