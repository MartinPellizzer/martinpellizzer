<p>Drimia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless dragon's tongue, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which appear in late summer. It has no true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Drimia aphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
