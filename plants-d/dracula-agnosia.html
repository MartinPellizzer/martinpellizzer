                    <h1>Dracula agnosia</h1>
<p>Dracula agnosia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and specific habitat requirements, Dracula agnosia is highly threatened by habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
