                    <h1>Deschampsia cespitosa var. alpicola</h1>
<p>Deschampsia cespitosa var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy flowers, typically appearing in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
