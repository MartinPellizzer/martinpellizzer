<p>Dactylis glomerata var. subglomerata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to withstand grazing and maintain productivity in marginal environments.</p>
