<p>Drosera pygmaea, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands and rainforests. Its small size, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height, makes it a unique and fascinating species.</p>
<p>Drosera pygmaea plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
