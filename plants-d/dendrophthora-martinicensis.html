<p>Dendrophthora martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Palo de Rosa* (*Palo de Rosa*), through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora martinicensis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
