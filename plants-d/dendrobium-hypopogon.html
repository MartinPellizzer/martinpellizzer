                    <h1>Dendrobium hypopogon</h1>
<p>Dendrobium hypopogon, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. Its stems are wiry and often branched, and it prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Dendrobium hypopogon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
