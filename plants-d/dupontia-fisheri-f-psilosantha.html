                    <h1>Dupontia fisheri f. psilosantha</h1>
<p>Dupontia fisheri f. psilosantha, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal dunes of California.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in stabilized dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
