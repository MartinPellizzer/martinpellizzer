                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. laxa</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. laxa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it an important component of dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
