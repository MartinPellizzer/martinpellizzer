<p>Dryopteris stanley-walkeri, commonly known as Stanley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
