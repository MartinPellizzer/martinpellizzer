<p>Dryopteris clintoniana var. genuina, commonly known as the Clintonia fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The foliage exhibits a delicate, lace-like appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
