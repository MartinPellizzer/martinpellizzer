                    <h1>Drynaria torulosa</h1>
<p>Drynaria torulosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hardy, leathery fronds that can withstand dry conditions, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Drynaria torulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates.</p>
