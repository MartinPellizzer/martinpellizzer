                    <h1>Draba alpina f. longipedunculata</h1>
<p>Draba alpina f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate rockcress, is a botanical variant of the alpine rockcress.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in elongated inflorescences, which is a distinguishing trait of this form. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
