                    <h1>Dryopteris sublaxa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sublaxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a silvery or rusty-colored margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
