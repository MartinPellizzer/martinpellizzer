<p>Drosera nitidula var. patens, commonly known as the smooth-surface sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other sundew varieties.</p>
<p>It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
