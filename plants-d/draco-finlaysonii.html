<p>Draco finlaysonii, commonly known as the Finlayson's draco, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its habitat is typically restricted to specific limestone-rich areas, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Draco finlaysonii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
