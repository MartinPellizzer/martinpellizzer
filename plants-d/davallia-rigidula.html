                    <h1>Davallia rigidula</h1>
<p>Davallia rigidula, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, rigid texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Davallia rigidula is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
