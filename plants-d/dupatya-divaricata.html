                    <h1>Dupatya divaricata</h1>
<p>Dupatya divaricata, commonly known as the variable leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
