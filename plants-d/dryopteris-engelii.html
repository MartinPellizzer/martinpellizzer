<p>Dryopteris engelii, commonly known as Engel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into multiple pinnae, which are lance-shaped and have a serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
