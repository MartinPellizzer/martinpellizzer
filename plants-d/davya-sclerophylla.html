                    <h1>Davya sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Davya sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved davya, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it a hardy species well-suited to Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
<p>Davya sclerophylla is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
