                    <h1>Dendrocolla arachnites</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla arachnites, commonly known as the spider lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, web-like thallus with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, more porous lower surface. The lichen is composed of a fungal partner and algae, with the fungus providing structural support and the algae performing photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator species for forest health.</p>
