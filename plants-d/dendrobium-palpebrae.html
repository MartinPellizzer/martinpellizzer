<p>Dendrobium palpebrae, commonly known as the eye-lid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive pattern resembling eyelids, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium palpebrae thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
