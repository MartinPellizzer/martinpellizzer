                <h1>Dendrospartum etnense</h1>
<p>Dendrospartum etnense, commonly known as the Etna candleplant, is a unique species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescences that rise above its basal rosette of leaves. The plant's foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help protect it from the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow and green, adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's overall structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dendrospartum etnense is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
