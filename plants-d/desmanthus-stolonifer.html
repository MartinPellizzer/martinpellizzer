                    <h1>Desmanthus stolonifer</h1>
<p>Desmanthus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Desmanthus stolonifer is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
