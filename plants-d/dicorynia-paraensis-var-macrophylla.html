<p>Dicorynia paraensis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *rosa-do-bom-rei*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered.</p>
