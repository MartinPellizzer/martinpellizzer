<p>Dendrobium lacustre, commonly known as the lake orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lacustre thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
