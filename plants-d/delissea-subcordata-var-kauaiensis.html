                    <h1>Delissea subcordata var. kauaiensis</h1>
<p>Delissea subcordata var. kauaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories, and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from extinction.</p>
