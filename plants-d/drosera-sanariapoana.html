                    <h1>Drosera sanariapoana</h1>
<p>Drosera sanariapoana, commonly known as the Sanariapoana Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, boggy environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage, which aids in insect adhesion.</p>
<p>Drosera sanariapoana is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
