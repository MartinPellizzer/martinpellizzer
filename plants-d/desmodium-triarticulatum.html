<p>Desmodium triarticulatum, commonly known as the three-jointed burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having three distinct segments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its unique feature is the presence of hooked, three-jointed burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Desmodium triarticulatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal medicines.</p>
