                    <h1>Dryopteris thibetica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are robust and help it anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
