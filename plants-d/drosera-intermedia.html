                    <h1>Drosera intermedia</h1>
<p>Drosera intermedia, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage.</p>
<p>It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ecological and botanical interest.</p>
