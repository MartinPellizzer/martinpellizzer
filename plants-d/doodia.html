                    <h1>Doodia</h1>
<p>Doodia, commonly known as the ferns of the genus Doodia, are a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spike-like structures. Doodia species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>They play an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
