                    <h1>Dryopteris caudipinna</h1>
<p>Dryopteris caudipinna, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping fronds that are covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some cases, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
