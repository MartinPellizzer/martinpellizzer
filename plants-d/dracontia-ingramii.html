                    <h1>Dracontia ingramii</h1>
<p>Dracontia ingramii, commonly known as the Ingram's dragon's beard, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading inflorescences that resemble a dragon's beard, with small, intricate flowers in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions with high air circulation, typically growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Dracontia ingramii is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation and protection.</p>
