<p>Diplazium psilopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats on the bottom of ponds or slow-moving streams. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium psilopteron plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
