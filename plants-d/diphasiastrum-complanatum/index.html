                            <h1>Diphasiastrum Complanatum</h1>
<p>Common horsetail, scientifically known as Diphasiastrum complanatum, is a resilient and ancient plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species belongs to the family Equisetaceae, which includes some of the oldest living plants on Earth. Its slender, jointed stems and whorled leaves give it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of its prehistoric ancestors. Despite its delicate look, common horsetail is highly adaptable and can be found in various parts of the world. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting diverse wildlife.</p>
