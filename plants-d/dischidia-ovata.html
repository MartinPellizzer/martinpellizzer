                    <h1>Dischidia ovata</h1>
<p>Dischidia ovata, commonly known as the bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that often appear swollen, resembling bubbles, hence its common name. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
