<p>Dyckia nana, commonly known as the dwarf dyckia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white and purple markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia nana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
