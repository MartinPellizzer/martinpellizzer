<p>Dryas punctata, commonly known as the alpine drumstick or mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is adapted to cold, harsh environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Dryas punctata plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing food for pollinators and shelter for small organisms.</p>
