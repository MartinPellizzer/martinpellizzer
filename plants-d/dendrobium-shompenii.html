                    <h1>Dendrobium shompenii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium shompenii, commonly known as the Shompen orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
