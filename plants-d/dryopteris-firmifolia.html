                    <h1>Dryopteris firmifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris firmifolia, commonly known as the firm-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
