                    <h1>Diplazium dilatatum var. heterolepis</h1>
<p>Diplazium dilatatum var. heterolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf hawksbeard, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with creeping underground stems that produce upright, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often arranged in a regular pattern. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the pinnae, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
