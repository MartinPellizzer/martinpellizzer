                    <h1>Desmodium</h1>
<p>Desmodium, commonly known as ticktrefoil, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a trifoliate pattern. Desmodium species are typically shrubs or herbs, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in their root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes them valuable in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture practices.</p>
