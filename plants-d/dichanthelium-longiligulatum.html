                    <h1>Dichanthelium longiligulatum</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium longiligulatum, commonly known as the long-ligule grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct ligule, a small, membranous structure at the base of each leaf blade. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet, which are often arranged in a loose, open panicle. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research.</p>
