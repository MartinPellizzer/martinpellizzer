                    <h1>Dracula anthracina</h1>
<p>Dracula anthracina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stem and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale pink or white flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
