                    <h1>Dendrobium anilii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium anilii, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Dendrobium anilii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
