<p>Drosera latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its broad, fleshy leaves are covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions.</p>
<p>Drosera latifolia is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
