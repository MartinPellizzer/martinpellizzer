<p>Dendrobium acinaciforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that are often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, sword-shaped lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium acinaciforme thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
