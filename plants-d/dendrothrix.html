                    <h1>Dendrothrix</h1>
<p>Dendrothrix, commonly known as the tree moss, is a type of bryophyte that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure that resembles a tree, giving it its scientific name. This plant forms dense mats on tree trunks and branches, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest floors. Dendrothrix lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids and protonemata for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
