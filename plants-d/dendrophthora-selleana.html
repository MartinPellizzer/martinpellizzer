                    <h1>Dendrophthora selleana</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora selleana, commonly known as the Selleana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, waxy flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>This unique relationship with its host plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
