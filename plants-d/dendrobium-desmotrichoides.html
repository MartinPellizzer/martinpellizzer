<p>Dendrobium desmotrichoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium desmotrichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display.</p>
