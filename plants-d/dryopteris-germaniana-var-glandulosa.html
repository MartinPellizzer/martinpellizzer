<p>Dryopteris germaniana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a fern species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its overall compact structure.</p>
