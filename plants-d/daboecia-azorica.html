<p>Daboecia azorica, commonly known as the Azorean heath, is a flowering plant native to the Azores, an archipelago in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant typically forms dense shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers.
