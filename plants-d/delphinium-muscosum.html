                    <h1>Delphinium muscosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium muscosum, commonly known as the mossy larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a somewhat moss-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
