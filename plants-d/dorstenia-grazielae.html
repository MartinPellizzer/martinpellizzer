                    <h1>Dorstenia grazielae</h1>
<p>Dorstenia grazielae, commonly known as the Grazielae Spider Plant, is a unique member of the Duglasieae tribe within the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a spider's web, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Dorstenia grazielae is a popular ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
