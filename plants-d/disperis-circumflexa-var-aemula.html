                    <h1>Disperis circumflexa var. aemula</h1>
<p>Disperis circumflexa var. aemula, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers along the stem, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
