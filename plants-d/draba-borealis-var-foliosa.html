                    <h1>Draba borealis var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Draba borealis var. foliosa, commonly known as the Arctic leafed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
