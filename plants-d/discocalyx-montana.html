<p>Discocalyx montana, commonly known as the mountain disc lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive white or pale colored lower layer. The thallus is composed of a complex interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
