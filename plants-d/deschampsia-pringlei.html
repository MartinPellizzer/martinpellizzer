<p>Deschampsia pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
