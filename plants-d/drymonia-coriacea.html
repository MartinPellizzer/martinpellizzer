                    <h1>Drymonia coriacea</h1>
<p>Drymonia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf greenbrier, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, coriaceous (leathery) leaves and thorny stems, which help it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>Drymonia coriacea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of the understory in hardwood forests.</p>
