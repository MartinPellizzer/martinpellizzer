                    <h1>Dicliptera saxicola</h1>
<p>Dicliptera saxicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Dicliptera saxicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance makes it an important component of the local flora in harsh environments.</p>
