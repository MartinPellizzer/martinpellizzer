                    <h1>Davallia trifoliata</h1>
<p>Davallia trifoliata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive trifoliate (three-part) leaflet structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new plants through spore reproduction.</p>
<p>The fern is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in indoor gardens due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
