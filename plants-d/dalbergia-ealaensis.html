<p>Dalbergia ealaensis, commonly known as the Ealaensis rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing flat, oblong seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
