                    <h1>Distylium dunnianum</h1>
<p>Distylium dunnianum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. While it can weaken its host tree over time, it plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with both its host and other mistletoe species.</p>
