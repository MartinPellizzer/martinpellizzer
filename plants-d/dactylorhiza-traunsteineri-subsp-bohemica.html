<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp.</p>
<p>bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Europe. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces dark green leaves and bears showy, violet or purple flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its intricate root system and mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
