<p>Deparia falcatipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water shield, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.
