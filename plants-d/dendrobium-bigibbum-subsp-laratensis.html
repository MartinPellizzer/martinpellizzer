<p>Dendrobium bigibbum subsp.</p>
<p>laratensis, commonly known as the Laratensian orchid, is a rare and distinctive species native to Borneo. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and thick, fleshy pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
