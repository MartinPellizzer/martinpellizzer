<p>Dalbergia scandens, commonly known as the climbing bean or velvetwood, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>Dalbergia scandens also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
