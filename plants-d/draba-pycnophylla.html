<p>Draba pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved whitlow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Draba pycnophylla is also noted for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
