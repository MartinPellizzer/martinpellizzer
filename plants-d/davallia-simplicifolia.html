<p>Davallia simplicifolia, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that resemble the feet of a hare, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Davallia simplicifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment.</p>
