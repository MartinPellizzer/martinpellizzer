                    <h1>Duvaua spinescens</h1>
<p>Duvaua spinescens, commonly known as the spiny leaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine spines, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its root system is extensive and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Duvaua spinescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
