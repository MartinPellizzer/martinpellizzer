                    <h1>Drosera collina</h1>
<p>Drosera collina, commonly known as the common sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring.</p>
<p>Drosera collina is a perennial herb that plays a role in nutrient-poor ecosystems by recycling nutrients from captured prey.</p>
