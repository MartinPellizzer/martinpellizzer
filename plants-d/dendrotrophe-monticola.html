                    <h1>Dendrotrophe monticola</h1>
<p>Dendrotrophe monticola, commonly known as the mountain mist fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that glow faintly in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, compact clusters along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Dendrotrophe monticola is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
