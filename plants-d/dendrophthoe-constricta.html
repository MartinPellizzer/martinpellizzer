                    <h1>Dendrophthoe constricta</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its floral structure is simple, with four to five petals and a distinctive elongated style.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe constricta is often found in coastal and tropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-lit environments.</p>
