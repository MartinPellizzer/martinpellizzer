                    <h1>Dictyogramme latipes</h1>
<p>Dictyogramme latipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, fan-like cluster. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, linear pinnae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
