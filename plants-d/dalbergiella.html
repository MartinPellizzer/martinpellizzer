                    <h1>Dalbergiella</h1>
<p>Dalbergiella, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions of Africa and are characterized by their compound leaves and distinctive pod fruits. Dalbergiella species often thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. They play a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock.</p>
