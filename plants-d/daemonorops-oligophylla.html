<p>Daemonorops oligophylla, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
