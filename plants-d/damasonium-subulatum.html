<p>Damasonium subulatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Damasonium subulatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
