<p>Dennstaedtia producta, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
