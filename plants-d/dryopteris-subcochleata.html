                    <h1>Dryopteris subcochleata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subcochleata, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curling fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory.</p>
