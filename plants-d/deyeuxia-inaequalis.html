<p>Deyeuxia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia inaequalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
