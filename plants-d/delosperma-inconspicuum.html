<p>Delosperma inconspicuum, commonly known as the silverleaf carpetweed, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal ground cover in dry, sunny gardens.</p>
