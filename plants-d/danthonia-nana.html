                    <h1>Danthonia nana</h1>
<p>Danthonia nana, commonly known as the dwarf danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
