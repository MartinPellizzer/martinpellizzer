                    <h1>Dendrophthora heterophylla</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a unique life cycle that involves both aerial and root systems, with its seeds dispersed by birds that consume its fleshy, red berries. The plant exhibits morphological variation in its leaves, which can range from broad and ovate to narrow and lanceolate depending on the host species. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora heterophylla plays an ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird species.</p>
