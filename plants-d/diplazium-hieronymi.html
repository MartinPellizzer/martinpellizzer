<p>Diplazium hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Diplazium hieronymi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
