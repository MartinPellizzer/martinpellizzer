                    <h1>Didymochlaena lunulata var. minor</h1>
<p>Didymochlaena lunulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser moon-leaf, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that resemble delicate lace, giving it a unique aesthetic. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
