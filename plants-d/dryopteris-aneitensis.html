<p>Dryopteris aneitensis, commonly known as the Aneityn Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
