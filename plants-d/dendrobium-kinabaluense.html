                    <h1>Dendrobium kinabaluense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude tropical rainforests, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
