                    <h1>Doryopteris campos-portoi</h1>
<p>Doryopteris campos-portoi, commonly known as the Campos-Portoi holly fern, is a rare fern species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rugged, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on rich, moist soil. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
