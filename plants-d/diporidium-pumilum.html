                    <h1>Diporidium pumilum</h1>
<p>Diporidium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives on bare rock surfaces in arid environments.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish coloration, with a dense, tightly packed thallus that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
