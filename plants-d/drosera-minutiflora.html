<p>Drosera minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sticky hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate floral display.</p>
<p>Drosera minutiflora is a low-growing plant with rosettes of hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat.</p>
