<p>Dryopteris latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a distinctive, narrow, needle-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
