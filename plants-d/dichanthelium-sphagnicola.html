<p>Dichanthelium sphagnicola, commonly known as the peatland grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted grass-like appearance and typically grows in peat bogs and other moist, acidic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often densely packed, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
