                    <h1>Drymaria frankenioides</h1>
<p>Drymaria frankenioides, commonly known as the Frankenioides mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and native landscaping.</p>
