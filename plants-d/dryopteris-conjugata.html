                    <h1>Dryopteris conjugata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris conjugata, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive interruption in the middle. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, with sporangia borne on the fertile fronds.</p>
