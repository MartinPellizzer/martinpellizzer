                    <h1>Droogmansia longipes</h1>
<p>Droogmansia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed droogmansia, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with the inflorescence emerging from the center. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with showy red bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
