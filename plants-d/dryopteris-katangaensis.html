                    <h1>Dryopteris katangaensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris katangaensis, commonly known as the Katanga shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
