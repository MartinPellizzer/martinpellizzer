<p>Draba stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like whitlowgrass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba stellarioides is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits.</p>
