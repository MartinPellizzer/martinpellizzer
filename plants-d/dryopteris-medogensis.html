                    <h1>Dryopteris medogensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris medogensis, commonly known as the Medog shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with cool and moist conditions. Its spores are typically produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
