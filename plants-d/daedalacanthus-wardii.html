<p>Daedalacanthus wardii, commonly known as the Ward's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, slender stem and a single, elongated leaf that supports its inflorescence. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
