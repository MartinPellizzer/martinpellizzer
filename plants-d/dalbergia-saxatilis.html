<p>Dalbergia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock almond or rock acacia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, often thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Dalbergia saxatilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna.</p>
