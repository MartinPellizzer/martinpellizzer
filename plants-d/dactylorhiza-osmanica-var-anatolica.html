<p>Dactylorhiza osmanica var. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, requiring consistently moist soil and partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
