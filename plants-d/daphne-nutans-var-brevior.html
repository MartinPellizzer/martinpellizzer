                    <h1>Daphne nutans var. brevior</h1>
<p>Daphne nutans var. brevior, commonly known as the dwarf winter daphne, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its short, branching stems and is typically smaller than the standard Daphne nutans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
