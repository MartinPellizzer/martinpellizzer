                    <h1>Dryopteris pseudovaria</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pseudovaria, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
