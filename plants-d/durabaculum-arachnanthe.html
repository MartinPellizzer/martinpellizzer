<p>Durabaculum arachnanthe, commonly known as the spider-thorn acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
