<p>Diplazium matamense, commonly known as the Matam√© fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in moist, tropical habitats.</p>
<p>Diplazium matamense plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
