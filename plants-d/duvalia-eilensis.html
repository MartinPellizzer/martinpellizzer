                    <h1>Duvalia eilensis</h1>
<p>Duvalia eilensis, commonly known as the Eilens Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic alga, which together form a composite organism known as a lichen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded areas along rocky coastlines, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its structure is typically crust-like, with a dense, dark green or brownish appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Duvalia eilensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
