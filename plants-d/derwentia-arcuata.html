                    <h1>Derwentia arcuata</h1>
<p>Derwentia arcuata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Derwentia arcuata is typically found in damp, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks.</p>
