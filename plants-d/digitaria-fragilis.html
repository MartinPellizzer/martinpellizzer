                    <h1>Digitaria fragilis</h1>
<p>Digitaria fragilis, commonly known as brittlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
