                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. variegata</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated grass or variegated goat's rue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring patches of white, pink, or cream on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical green color of most grasses. This variety thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can also serve as forage for livestock.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dense spikelets that form clusters, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
