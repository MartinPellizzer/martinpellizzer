<p>Darluca, commonly known as the moonflower, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, opening in response to darkness and closing at dawn. The leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, while the stems are woody and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. Darluca thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and support for its climbing habit.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening and traditional medicine.</p>
