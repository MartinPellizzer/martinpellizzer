                    <h1>Dendrochilum haslamii var. quadrilobum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum haslamii var. quadrilobum, commonly known as the four-lobed tree orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, quadrilobed pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical rainforest environments. Its foliage consists of strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
