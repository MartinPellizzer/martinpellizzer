<p>Drimia uitenhagensis, commonly known as the Uitenhage bulb, is a striking geophyte native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its most notable characteristic is its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It blooms during the spring and summer months, typically in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
