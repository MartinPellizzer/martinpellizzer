<p>Dicliptera laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf dicliptera, is a tropical perennial grass native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically smooth to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dicliptera laevigata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>
