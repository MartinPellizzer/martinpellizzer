                    <h1>Desmodium racemosum</h1>
<p>Desmodium racemosum, commonly known as the hairy gladecress, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in small, hairy pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Desmodium racemosum is often used in ecological restoration due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
