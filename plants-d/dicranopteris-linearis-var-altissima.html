<p>Dicranopteris linearis var. altissima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to several meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams or wetlands. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
