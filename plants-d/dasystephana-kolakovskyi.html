<p>Dasystephana kolakovskyi, commonly known as the Kolakovsky's starflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
