                    <h1>Dryopteris blepharochlamys</h1>
<p>Dryopteris blepharochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, elongated shape and a distinctive, finely divided appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover called a indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
