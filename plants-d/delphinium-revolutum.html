<p>Delphinium revolutum, commonly known as the revolute larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Delphinium revolutum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its presence of alkaloids.</p>
