<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena renardiae is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments and is highly susceptible to habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
