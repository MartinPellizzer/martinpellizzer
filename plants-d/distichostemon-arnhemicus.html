<p>Distichostemon arnhemicus, commonly known as the Northern River Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive central vein. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
