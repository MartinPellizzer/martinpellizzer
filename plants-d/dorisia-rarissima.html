<p>Dorisia rarissima, commonly known as the rare dorisia, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
