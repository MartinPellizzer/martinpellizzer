<p>Dischidia parasita, commonly known as the parasitic fig vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. It typically grows on trees or shrubs in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Dischidia parasita is often found in humid environments and can be a common epiphyte in rainforests.</p>
