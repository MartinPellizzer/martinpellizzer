                    <h1>Davallia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Davallia lanceolata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that produces adventitious roots and small, clustered fiddleheads. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically dark green with a silvery underside, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Davallia lanceolata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
