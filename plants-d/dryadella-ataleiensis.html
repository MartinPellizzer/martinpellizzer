<p>Dryadella ataleiensis, commonly known as the Atalay Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Atalaia in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that grow from a bulbous stem, typical of many Amaryllidaceae species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
