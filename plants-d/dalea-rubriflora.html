                    <h1>Dalea rubriflora</h1>
<p>Dalea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Dalea rubriflora plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
