<p>Dryopteris longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a glossy, dark green surface.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
