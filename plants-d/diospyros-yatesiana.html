                    <h1>Diospyros yatesiana</h1>
<p>Diospyros yatesiana, commonly known as the Yate's persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-gray bark and elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that ripen in the summer. Diospyros yatesiana is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a sweet, slightly astringent flavor.</p>
