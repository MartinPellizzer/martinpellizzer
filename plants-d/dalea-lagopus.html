                    <h1>Dalea lagopus</h1>
<p>Dalea lagopus, commonly known as the snowblume, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that release tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Dalea lagopus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
