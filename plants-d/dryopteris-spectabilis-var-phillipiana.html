                    <h1>Dryopteris spectabilis var. phillipiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spectabilis var. phillipiana, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
