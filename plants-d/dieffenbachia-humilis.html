<p>Dieffenbachia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dieffenbachia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy, light green leaves with distinctive white and cream veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children.</p>
