                    <h1>Dalea villosa</h1>
<p>Dalea villosa, commonly known as hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces clusters of pink to purple pea-shaped flowers. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Dalea villosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems.</p>
