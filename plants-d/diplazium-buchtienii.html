<p>Diplazium buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Diplazium buchtienii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
