                    <h1>Dendrophylax gracilis</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax gracilis, commonly known as the slender flying squirrel orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in the understory of forests. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are highly fragrant, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its canopy-dwelling habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
