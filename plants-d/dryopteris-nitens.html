                    <h1>Dryopteris nitens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nitens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its distinctive growth pattern.</p>
