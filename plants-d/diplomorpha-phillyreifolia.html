<p>Diplomorpha phillyreifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
