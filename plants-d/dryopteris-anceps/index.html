                            <h1>Dryopteris Anceps</h1>
<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Dryopteris anceps, is a striking native plant found in moist woodlands across eastern North America. With its tall, arching fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, it is both visually distinctive and ecologically valuable. This fern thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and plays a key role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, the cinnamon fern requires specific growing conditions to flourish, making it a rewarding but demanding plant for gardeners.</p>
