                    <h1>Democrita resinosa</h1>
<p>Democrita resinosa, commonly known as the golden resin plant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are coated in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its most notable feature is the thick, amber-colored resin it secretes, which hardens into a valuable substance used in traditional medicine and incense.</p>
<p>The resin also plays a role in attracting certain insect pollinators.</p>
