                    <h1>Drepaphyla lanigera</h1>
<p>Drepaphyla lanigera, commonly known as the woolly drepaphyla, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name and provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Drepaphyla lanigera is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
