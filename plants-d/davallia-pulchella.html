                    <h1>Davallia pulchella</h1>
<p>Davallia pulchella, commonly known as the "maiden's hair fern," is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds with a feathery texture, often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>
<p>Davallia pulchella is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
