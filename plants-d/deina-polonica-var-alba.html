                    <h1>Deina polonica var. alba</h1>
<p>Deina polonica var. alba, commonly known as the white polonica lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in specific, often nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its pale or white thallus, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Deina polonica. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together enable it to survive in harsh conditions. It is typically found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health.</p>
