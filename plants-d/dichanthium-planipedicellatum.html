                    <h1>Dichanthium planipedicellatum</h1>
<p>Dichanthium planipedicellatum, commonly known as the flat-cell panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to dry environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to regrow from its rhizomes after periods of moisture.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization.</p>
