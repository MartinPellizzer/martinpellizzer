                    <h1>Dryopteris × martinsiae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × martinsiae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to form thick, lush clumps over time.</p>
