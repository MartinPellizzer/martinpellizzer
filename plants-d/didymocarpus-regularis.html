<p>Didymocarpus regularis, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces woody fruits that contain flat, seed-like structures called arils. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand for its valuable timber, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
