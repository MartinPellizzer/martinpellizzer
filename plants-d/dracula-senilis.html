                    <h1>Dracula senilis</h1>
<p>Dracula senilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Dracula senilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
