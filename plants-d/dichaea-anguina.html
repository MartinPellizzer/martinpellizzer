                    <h1>Dichaea anguina</h1>
<p>Dichaea anguina, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and its striking, snake-like appearance due to its elongated, twisted flower spikes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dichaea anguina is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
