                    <h1>Dendromyza mucronulata</h1>
<p>Dendromyza mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Dendromyza mucronulata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees, influencing their growth and sometimes contributing to their decline.</p>
