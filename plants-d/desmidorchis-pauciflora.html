                    <h1>Desmidorchis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Desmidorchis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short-lived, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a faintly colored lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
