                    <h1>Dendrobium chrysotis</h1>
<p>Dendrobium chrysotis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium chrysotis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
