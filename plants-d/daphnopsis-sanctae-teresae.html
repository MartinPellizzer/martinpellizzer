                    <h1>Daphnopsis sanctae-teresae</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis sanctae-teresae, commonly known as the Santa Teresa daphnopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of central Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture, adapted to its humid and shaded habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
