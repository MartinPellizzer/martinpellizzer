                <h1>Dryopteris philippinensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
