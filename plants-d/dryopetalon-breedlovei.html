<p>Dryopetalon breedlovei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
