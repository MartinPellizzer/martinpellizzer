                    <h1>Dennstaedtia scabra</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia scabra, commonly known as the rough fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The rough texture of its leaves, from which it gets its common name, is due to the presence of small, raised dots called rhizomata.</p>
