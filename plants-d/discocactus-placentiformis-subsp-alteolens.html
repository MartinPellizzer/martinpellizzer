<p>Discocactus placentiformis subsp.</p>
<p>alteolens, commonly known as the high-ribbed discocactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, rib-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the stem tips. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
