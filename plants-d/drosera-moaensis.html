                    <h1>Drosera moaensis</h1>
<p>Drosera moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from its prey. Its small, clustered leaves form a rosette structure, and it produces delicate pink or red flowers during the spring.</p>
<p>This species is considered rare and is often found in the remnants of ancient forests in New Zealand.</p>
