                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis f. maculata</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis f. maculata, commonly known as the spotted marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single erect stem bearing several elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces a raceme of pale green to yellowish flowers with distinctive dark brown or purple spots on the dorsal sepal and petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it thrives in wet meadows and fens.</p>
<p>This orchid is protected in many regions due to habitat loss and is a key indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
