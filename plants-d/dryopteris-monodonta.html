                <h1>Dryopteris monodonta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris monodonta, commonly known as the single-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a single central vein and secondary veins that are parallel. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
