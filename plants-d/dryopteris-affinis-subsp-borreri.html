<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>borreri, commonly known as the Borreri wood fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in forest understories and rocky habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
