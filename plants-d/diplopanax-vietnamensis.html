                    <h1>Diplopanax vietnamensis</h1>
<p>Diplopanax vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas in slow-moving or still waters. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
