<p>Daemonorops mirabilis, commonly known as the giant panda fern, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones rather than flowers, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops mirabilis is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
