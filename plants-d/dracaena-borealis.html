                    <h1>Dracaena borealis</h1>
<p>Dracaena borealis, commonly known as the Arctic dracaena, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to the Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
