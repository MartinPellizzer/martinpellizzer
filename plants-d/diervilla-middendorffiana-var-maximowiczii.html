                    <h1>Diervilla middendorffiana var. maximowiczii</h1>
<p>Diervilla middendorffiana var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Maximowicz's hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, upright growth with small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes.</p>
