                    <h1>Dendrolirium kamlangensis</h1>
<p>Dendrolirium kamlangensis, commonly known as the Kamlang orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive purple throat. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrolirium kamlangensis is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
