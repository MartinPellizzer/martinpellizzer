                    <h1>Dactylorhiza × juennensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza × juennensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Dactylorhiza lapponica and Dactylorhiza macrantha, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments. It produces tall, erect stems with clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it is often found in areas where the parent species overlap geographically.</p>
