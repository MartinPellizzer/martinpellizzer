<p>Davallia korthalsii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are pinnately compound with a graceful, arching appearance.</p>
<p>Davallia korthalsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor settings.</p>
