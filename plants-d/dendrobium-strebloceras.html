<p>Dendrobium strebloceras, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can become woody over time, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
