<p>Duguetia manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus beauty or Amazonian bellflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy of the rainforest, where it can access light and moisture. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive red throat, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Duguetia manausensis plays a role in the rainforest ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
