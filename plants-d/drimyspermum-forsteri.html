                    <h1>Drimyspermum forsteri</h1>
<p>Drimyspermum forsteri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various native trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale green, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature means it relies on host trees for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
