<p>Dryopteris leveillei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
