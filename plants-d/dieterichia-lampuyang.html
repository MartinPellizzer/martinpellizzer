                    <h1>Dieterichia lampuyang</h1>
<p>Dieterichia lampuyang, commonly known as the Bornean flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
