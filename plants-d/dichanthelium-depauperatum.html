                <h1>Dichanthelium depauperatum</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a small annual grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its low nutritional value, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
