<p>Dianthus carthusianorum subsp.</p>
<p>alpester, commonly known as the alpine carnation, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its flowers are composed of five petals that are often marked with dark veins, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky soils and mountainous areas.</p>
