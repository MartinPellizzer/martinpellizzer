<p>Drosera roseana, commonly known as the pink sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish-pink in color, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and swamps.</p>
<p>Drosera roseana is known for its ability to digest captured insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
