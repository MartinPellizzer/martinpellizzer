<p>Dryopteris patula var. chaerophylloides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow to bronze-colored fronds, which contrast with its dark green undersides. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, overlapping pinnae that give it a dense, shield-like appearance.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
