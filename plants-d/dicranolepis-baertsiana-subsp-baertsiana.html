<p>Dicranolepis baertsiana subsp.</p>
<p>baertsiana, commonly known as the Baertsian's fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
