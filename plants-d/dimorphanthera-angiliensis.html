<p>Dimorphanthera angiliensis, commonly known as the Angilinya rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>

Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a spike, with a distinct lip that is often marked with purple or brown markings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land degradation.</p>
