<p>Deyeuxia sulcata, commonly known as the ridgegrass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
