<p>Daucus bessarabicus, commonly known as the Bessarabian carrot, is a flowering plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the domesticated carrot.</p>
<p>Daucus bessarabicus is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered a wild relative of cultivated carrots.</p>
