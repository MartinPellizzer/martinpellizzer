<p>Dianthus brachyanthus var. obesus, commonly known as the fat-leaf campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
