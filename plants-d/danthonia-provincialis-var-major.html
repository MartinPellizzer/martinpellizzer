<p>Danthonia provincialis var. major, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
