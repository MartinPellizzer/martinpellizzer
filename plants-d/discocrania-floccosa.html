<p>Discocrania floccosa, commonly known as the fluffhead lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, cotton-like growth.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, soil, or stone in temperate and boreal regions. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga. Its structure includes a leaf-like upper surface covered with a layer of fine, white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>Discocrania floccosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality.</p>
