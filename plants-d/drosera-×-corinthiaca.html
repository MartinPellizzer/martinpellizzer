                    <h1>Drosera × corinthiaca</h1>
<p>Drosera × corinthiaca, commonly known as the Corinthian sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera intermedia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a unique subject in the study of plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
