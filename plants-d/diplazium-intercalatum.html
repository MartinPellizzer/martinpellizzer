<p>Diplazium intercalatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of moss. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a dense, compact structure that resembles a staghorn. Its fronds are divided into two types: fertile and sterile, with the fertile ones bearing spore-producing structures called sorangia.</p>
<p>Diplazium intercalatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
