                    <h1>Dictyophleba ochracea</h1>
<p>Dictyophleba ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
