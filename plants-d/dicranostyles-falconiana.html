<p>Dicranostyles falconiana, commonly known as the Falcon's Island moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense, leafy structure with small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, water-repelling cells. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying bryophyte ecology and conservation.</p>
