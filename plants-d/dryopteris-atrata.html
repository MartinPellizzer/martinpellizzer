                    <h1>Dryopteris atrata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris atrata, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in elongated sori. Dryopteris atrata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
