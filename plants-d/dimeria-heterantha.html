<p>Dimeria heterantha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive ray floret structure. The plant has small, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Dimeria heterantha plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems.</p>
