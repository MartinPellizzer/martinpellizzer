<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are usually yellowish-green, and it produces small, white flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Drosera lutescens is a low-growing plant that thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
