                    <h1>Diplodiscus microlepis</h1>
<p>Diplodiscus microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
