                    <h1>Diphyes lichenoides</h1>
<p>Diphyes lichenoides, commonly known as the flaky lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, parchment-like appearance.</p>
<p>It forms a thin, crusty layer on rocks and tree bark, often in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, typical of many lichens. It lacks a distinct leafy structure but has a broad, irregularly shaped body.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration.</p>
