                    <h1>Davallia stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Davallia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
