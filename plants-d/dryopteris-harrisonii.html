<p>Dryopteris harrisonii, commonly known as Harrison's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
