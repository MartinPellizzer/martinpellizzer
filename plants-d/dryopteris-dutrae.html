                    <h1>Dryopteris dutrae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
