                    <h1>Dryopteris poecilophlebia var. grandidentata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris poecilophlebia var. grandidentata, commonly known as the giant fern or broad-crested wood fern, is a variant of the broad-crested fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often slightly curved and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
