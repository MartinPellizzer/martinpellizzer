<p>Dubrueilia riedlei, commonly known as the Riedl's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees and flies, showcasing a unique ecological relationship.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dubrueilia riedlei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
