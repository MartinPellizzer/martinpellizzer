                    <h1>Draba glacialis var. pectinata</h1>
<p>Draba glacialis var. pectinata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This variety is distinguished by its pectinate (comb-like) leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia.</p>
