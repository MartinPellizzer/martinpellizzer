<p>Drimycarpus luridus, commonly known as the yellow flax or golden flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Drimycarpus luridus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
