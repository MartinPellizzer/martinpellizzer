<p>Dendrobium taveuniense, commonly known as the Taveuni orchid, is a species of orchid native to the island of Taveuni in the Fiji archipelago.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high levels of indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
