<p>Dicliptera adusta, commonly known as the blackbeard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Dicliptera adusta is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it can become invasive.</p>
