                    <h1>Dryopteris microbasis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris microbasis, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features a compact, creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded landscapes.</p>
