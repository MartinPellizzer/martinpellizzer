                    <h1>Danthonia dusenii</h1>
<p>Danthonia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Danthonia dusenii is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
