                <h1>Desmotrichum scopa</h1>
<p>Desmotrichum scopa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
