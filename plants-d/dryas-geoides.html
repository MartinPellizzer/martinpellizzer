                    <h1>Dryas geoides</h1>
<p>Dryas geoides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths composed of tightly packed, succulent leaves that help retain heat and moisture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Dryas geoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
