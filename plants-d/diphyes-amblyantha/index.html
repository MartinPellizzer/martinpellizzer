                            <h1>Diphyes Amblyantha</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Diphyes amblyantha, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling coral in color and texture. This tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces due to its showy display. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans if ingested.</p>
