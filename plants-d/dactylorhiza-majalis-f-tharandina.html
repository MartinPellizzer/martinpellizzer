<p>Dactylorhiza majalis f. tharandina, commonly known as the Tharandt orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system adapted to its nutrient-poor, acidic habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color.</p>
