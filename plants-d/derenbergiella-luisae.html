                    <h1>Derenbergiella luisae</h1>
<p>Derenbergiella luisae, commonly known as the Luisa's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring during the cooler months, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Derenbergiella luisae is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
