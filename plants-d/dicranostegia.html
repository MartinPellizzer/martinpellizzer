                    <h1>Dicranostegia</h1>
<p>Dicranostegia, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Dicranostegia species are characterized by their small, leafy structures and lack of true roots, stems, and vascular tissue. They play an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species that are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
