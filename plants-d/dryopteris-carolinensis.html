                    <h1>Dryopteris carolinensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris carolinensis, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat.</p>
