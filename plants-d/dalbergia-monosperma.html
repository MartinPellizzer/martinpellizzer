                    <h1>Dalbergia monosperma</h1>
<p>Dalbergia monosperma, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in furniture and musical instrument making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
