                    <h1>Dendrophthoe rugulosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to various host plants, primarily in the legume family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, hairy stem covered in tiny, thread-like branches. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host plant and then developing a specialized structure to penetrate the host's tissues.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe rugulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can thrive on a variety of plant hosts.</p>
