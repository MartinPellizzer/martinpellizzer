                    <h1>Dryopteris exindusiiata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris exindusiiata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennials, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides.</p>
