<p>Deschampsia hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hairgrass, is a native grass species found exclusively on the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant with fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to invasive species, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
