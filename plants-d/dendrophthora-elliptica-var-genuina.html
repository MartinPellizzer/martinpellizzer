                    <h1>Dendrophthora elliptica var. genuina</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora elliptica var. genuina, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are toxic to most animals. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes for additional energy. It is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
