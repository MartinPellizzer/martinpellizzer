<p>Dicranopteris pectinata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the surface of water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris pectinata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
