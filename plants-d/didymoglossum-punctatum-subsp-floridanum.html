<p>Didymoglossum punctatum subsp.</p>
<p>floridanum, commonly known as the Florida toothwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamp forests and is often found in association with specific tree species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
