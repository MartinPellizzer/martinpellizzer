                    <h1>Diatrema purpurea</h1>
<p>Diatrema purpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Its roots are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Diatrema purpurea thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in forested areas.</p>
