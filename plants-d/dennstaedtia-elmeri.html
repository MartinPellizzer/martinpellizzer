<p>Dennstaedtia elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate rainforest ecosystems.</p>
