                    <h1>Dryopteris finisterrae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroe Islands wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Faroe Islands.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fronds that are bi- to tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
