<p>Dryopteris gemmipara, commonly known as the gemma-bearing wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant reproduces primarily through gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that form on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
