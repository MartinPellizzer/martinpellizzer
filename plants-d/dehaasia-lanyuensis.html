                    <h1>Dehaasia lanyuensis</h1>
<p>Dehaasia lanyuensis, commonly known as the Lanyu mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Lanyu in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant thrives in the moist, shaded understory of subtropical forests, where it relies on consistent humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dehaasia lanyuensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
