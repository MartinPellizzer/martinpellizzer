                    <h1>Diplachne spicata</h1>
<p>Diplachne spicata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense stands, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Diplachne spicata is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
