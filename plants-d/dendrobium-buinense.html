                    <h1>Dendrobium buinense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium buinense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
