                    <h1>Dresslerella archilae</h1>
<p>Dresslerella archilae, commonly known as the St. Helena orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>This terrestrial orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the warmer months, and is pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
