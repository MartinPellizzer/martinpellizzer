<p>Dendrosicyos jaubertianus, commonly known as the giant rat-tail cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, resembling a rat's tail. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the tips of the stems, followed by red, berry-like fruits.
