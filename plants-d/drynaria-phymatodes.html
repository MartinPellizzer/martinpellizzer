                    <h1>Drynaria phymatodes</h1>
<p>Drynaria phymatodes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Drynaria genus.</p>
