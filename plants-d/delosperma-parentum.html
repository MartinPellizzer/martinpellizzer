<p>Delosperma parentum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its low-growing habit makes it an ideal ground cover in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Delosperma parentum is also known for its ability to tolerate full sun and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
