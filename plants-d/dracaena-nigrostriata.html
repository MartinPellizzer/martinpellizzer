<p>Dracaena nigrostriata, commonly known as the black-striated dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, strap-like leaves that are dark green with distinctive black or dark purple stripes running along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena nigrostriata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its hardiness and attractive appearance.</p>
