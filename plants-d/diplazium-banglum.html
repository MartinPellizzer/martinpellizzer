<p>Diplazium banglum, commonly known as the Bangladeshi water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium banglum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
