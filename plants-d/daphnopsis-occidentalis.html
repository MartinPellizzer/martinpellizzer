<p>Daphnopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the western daphnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, often at high altitudes. Its ornamental value is due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes in its foliage.</p>
