                    <h1>Dactylorhiza pardalina</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza pardalina, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single, upright stem with several lance-shaped leaves and a spike of purple or pink flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment, a common adaptation in orchids.</p>
<p>The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
