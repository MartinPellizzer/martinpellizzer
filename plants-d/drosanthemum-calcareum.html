                    <h1>Drosanthemum calcareum</h1>
<p>Drosanthemum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone daisies, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its unique adaptations to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly regions with limestone soils, which influence its growth habits and nutrient uptake. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in coastal and inland areas with high salinity and alkaline conditions.</p>
