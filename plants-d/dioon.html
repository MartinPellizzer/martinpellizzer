<p>Dioon, commonly known as the "Mexican fern," is a genus of cycads native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Dioon species are dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female.</p>
<p>These ancient plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing their resilience and unique botanical characteristics.</p>
