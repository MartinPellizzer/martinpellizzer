                    <h1>Drymaria fendleri var. perennis</h1>
<p>Drymaria fendleri var. perennis, commonly known as desert sandpapery, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, sand-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to the desert landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
