                <h1>Dennstaedtia smithii</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia smithii, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a sword. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color.</p>
