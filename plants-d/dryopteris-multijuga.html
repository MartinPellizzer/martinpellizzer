                    <h1>Dryopteris multijuga</h1>
<p>Dryopteris multijuga, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks or in rich woodland soils. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
