<p>Diasperus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
