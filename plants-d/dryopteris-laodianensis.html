                    <h1>Dryopteris laodianensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris laodianensis, commonly known as the Lao Dan fern, is a species of polypod fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
