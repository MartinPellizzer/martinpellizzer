                    <h1>Diplazium mettenianum var. isobasis</h1>
<p>Diplazium mettenianum var. isobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Diplazium.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of its colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is based on its narrower leaflets compared to the typical form of Diplazium mettenianum.</p>
