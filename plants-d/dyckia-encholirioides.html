<p>Dyckia encholirioides, commonly known as the Chilean dyckia, is a bromeliad native to Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
