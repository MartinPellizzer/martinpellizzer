<p>Dipteracanthus vagans, commonly known as the wandering dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dipteracaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
