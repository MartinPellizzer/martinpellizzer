                    <h1>Dionaea</h1>
<p>Dionaea, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized leaves that function as traps, each consisting of two lobes with sensitive trigger hairs. When an insect touches these hairs, the leaves rapidly snap shut, capturing the prey. The plant digests the trapped insects using enzymes secreted within the leaf's interior.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant adaptation and predation.</p>
