                    <h1>Dimocarpus cinereus var. echinatus</h1>
<p>Dimocarpus cinereus var. echinatus, commonly known as the rough-skin date palm, is a variant of the date palm native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves with a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is typically smaller and less sweet than standard date palms. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to challenging environmental conditions.</p>
