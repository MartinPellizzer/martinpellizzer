<p>Diplectria viminalis, commonly known as the water willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and marshes, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the water's edge. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Diplectria viminalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
