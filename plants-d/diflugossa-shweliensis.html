                    <h1>Diflugossa shweliensis</h1>
<p>Diflugossa shweliensis, commonly known as the Shweliensis fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds, which feature a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules, typical of the fern family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diflugossa shweliensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
