                    <h1>Dryopteris mollissima</h1>
<p>Dryopteris mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern characterized by its soft, velvety fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its delicate appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
