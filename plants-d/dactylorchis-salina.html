<p>Dactylorchis salina, commonly known as the salt marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, adapting to high salt concentrations in its environment. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.
