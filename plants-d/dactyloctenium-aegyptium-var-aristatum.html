                    <h1>Dactyloctenium aegyptium var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium aegyptium var. aristatum, commonly known as the Egyptian carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with rhizomes that help it spread across the ground. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale green spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
