                    <h1>Dryopteris disjuncta f. erecta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris disjuncta f. erecta, commonly known as the upright cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on cliffs or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for taxonomists and horticulturists.</p>
