<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the sticky dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies viscosa is distinguished by the presence of a sticky substance on the leaves, which may deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
