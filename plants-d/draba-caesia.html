                    <h1>Draba caesia</h1>
<p>Draba caesia, commonly known as the sky-blue draba, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba caesia blooms in early spring, producing clusters of blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
