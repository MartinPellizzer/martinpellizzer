<p>Dryopteris brausei, commonly known as the Brause's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
