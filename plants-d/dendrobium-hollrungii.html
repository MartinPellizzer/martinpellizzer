                    <h1>Dendrobium hollrungii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium hollrungii, commonly known as the Orchid of the Southern Mountains, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its often dry and shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown.</p>
<p>Dendrobium hollrungii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance.</p>
