<p>Dendrophthora sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered near the base of its stems. The plant produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora sessilifolia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
