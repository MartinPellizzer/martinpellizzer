                    <h1>Dryopteris × arecesiae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × arecesiae, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant produces no spores, as it is a sterile hybrid, making it primarily ornamental in nature. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its role as a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus.</p>
