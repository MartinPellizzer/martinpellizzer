                    <h1>Dipteracanthus viscidulus var. abortivus</h1>
<p>Dipteracanthus viscidulus var. abortivus, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a variant of the sticky bladder fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of sticky secretions on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, viscous substance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction of var. abortivus is primarily based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and the degree of stickiness observed in its foliage.</p>
