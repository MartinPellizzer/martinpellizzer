<p>Discocactus zehntneri subsp.</p>
<p>boomianus, commonly known as the Boomer's discocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in late summer. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in the wild.</p>
