                    <h1>Doronicum austriacum f. longisepala</h1>
<p>Doronicum austriacum f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled Austrian leopard's bane, is a rare botanical variant of the Doronicum austriacum species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped sepals that distinguish it from the typical form of the plant. This perennial herb is native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central purple or brown spot.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
