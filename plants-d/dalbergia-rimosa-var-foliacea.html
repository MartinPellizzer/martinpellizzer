                    <h1>Dalbergia rimosa var. foliacea</h1>
<p>Dalbergia rimosa var. foliacea, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and lanceolate leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, leathery pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood, it is valued for furniture and decorative purposes, though it is also threatened by overharvesting.</p>
