                    <h1>Dryopteris riograndensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
