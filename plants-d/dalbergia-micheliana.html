                    <h1>Dalbergia micheliana</h1>
<p>Dalbergia micheliana, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is often overharvested, leading to conservation concerns.</p>
