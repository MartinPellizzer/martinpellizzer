                    <h1>Dianthus wulfenii</h1>
<p>Dianthus wulfenii, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Dianthus wulfenii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
