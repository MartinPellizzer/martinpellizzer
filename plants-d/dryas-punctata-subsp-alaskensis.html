<p>Dryas punctata subsp.</p>
<p>alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white to greyish hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability to harsh climates, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
