<p>Dorycnium decumbens, commonly known as the creeping burr vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Dorycnium decumbens is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
