<p>Diplusodon retroimbricatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that provide shade to the water surface.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, aiding in buoyancy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Diplusodon retroimbricatus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting aquatic life and improving water quality.</p>
