                    <h1>Deschampsia cespitosa var. colorata</h1>
<p>Deschampsia cespitosa var. colorata, commonly known as the purple false beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its striking purple to reddish inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the more common green form of the species. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
