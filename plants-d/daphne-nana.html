<p>Daphne nana, commonly known as dwarf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lilac, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its compact form makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Daphne nana is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and protection from strong winds.</p>
