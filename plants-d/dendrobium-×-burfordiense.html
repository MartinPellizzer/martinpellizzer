<p>Dendrobium × burfordiense, commonly known as the Burford's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × burfordiense requires specific care, including bright indirect light and consistent moisture, to thrive in cultivation.</p>
