<p>Deschampsia hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
