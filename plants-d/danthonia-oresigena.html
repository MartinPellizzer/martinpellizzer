                    <h1>Danthonia oresigena</h1>
<p>Danthonia oresigena, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters.</p>
<p>Danthonia oresigena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range.</p>
