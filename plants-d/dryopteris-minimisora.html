<p>Dryopteris minimisora, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover in shaded areas. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, contributing to its ability to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are covered in tiny, scale-like structures that give the plant its characteristic appearance.</p>
