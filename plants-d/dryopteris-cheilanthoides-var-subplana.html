                    <h1>Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. subplana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. subplana, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with proper conditions.</p>
