<p>Dendrophthora werffii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a unique relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora werffii plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the food web and influencing forest dynamics.</p>
