<p>Dryopteris metteniana, commonly known as the Metteniana wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
