                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia var. furcata</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia var. furcata, commonly known as the forked round-leaved sundew, is a variant of the common sundew characterized by its distinctive forked leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is a carnivorous species native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically blooms with small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats by recycling nutrients from captured prey.</p>
