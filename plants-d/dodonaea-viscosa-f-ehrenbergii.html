                    <h1>Dodonaea viscosa f. ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Dodonaea viscosa f. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the silverleaf dogwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, bead-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
