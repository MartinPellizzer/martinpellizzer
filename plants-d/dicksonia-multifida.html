<p>Dicksonia multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that are typically narrow and divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and can reach significant lengths, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
