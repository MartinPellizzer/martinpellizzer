<p>Duperrea pavettifolia var. scabra is a rare and intriguing plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. Known for its distinctive rough, hairy foliage and unique floral structure, it stands out among its relatives in the Rubiaceae family. This variant is particularly prized by botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological significance. Despite its beauty, it remains under-studied and endangered due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. Its survival is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
