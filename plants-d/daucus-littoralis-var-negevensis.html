                    <h1>Daucus littoralis var. negevensis</h1>
<p>Daucus littoralis var. negevensis, commonly known as the Negev coastal carrot, is a rare variant of the coastal carrot native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in Israel and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its root system is relatively short and fibrous, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
