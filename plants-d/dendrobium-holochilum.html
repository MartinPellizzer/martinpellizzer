<p>Dendrobium holochilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium holochilum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its vibrant blooms.</p>
