                    <h1>Dolichlasium glanduliferum</h1>
<p>Dolichlasium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often have a sticky surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The sticky glands on its leaves may serve to deter herbivores or aid in water retention.</p>
