                    <h1>Demorchis rwandensis</h1>
<p>Demorchis rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Rwanda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that come in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle greenish tinge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, Demorchis rwandensis remains a poorly understood species with conservation concerns.</p>
