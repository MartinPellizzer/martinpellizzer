<p>Dunbaria rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
