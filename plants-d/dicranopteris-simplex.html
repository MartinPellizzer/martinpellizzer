<p>Dicranopteris simplex, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into smaller, feather-like segments called pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
