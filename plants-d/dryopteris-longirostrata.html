<p>Dryopteris longirostrata, commonly known as the long-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
