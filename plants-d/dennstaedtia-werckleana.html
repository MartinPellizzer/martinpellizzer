<p>Dennstaedtia werckleana, commonly known as the Wercklean shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex arrangement of pinnae.</p>
