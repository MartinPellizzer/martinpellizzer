                    <h1>Diplazium rubicaule</h1>
<p>Diplazium rubicaule, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
