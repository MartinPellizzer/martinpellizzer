                    <h1>Dupatya macrorhiza</h1>
<p>Dupatya macrorhiza, commonly known as the broad-rooted fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Dupatya macrorhiza is often found in forest understories, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
