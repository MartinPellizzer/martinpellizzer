                    <h1>Dissotis irvingiana</h1>
<p>Dissotis irvingiana, commonly known as the Irving's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Dissotis irvingiana plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
