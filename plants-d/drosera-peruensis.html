                    <h1>Drosera peruensis</h1>
<p>Drosera peruensis, commonly known as the Peruvian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Drosera peruensis is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in controlling insect populations.</p>
