<p>Dorycnium suffruticosum subsp.</p>
<p>jordanianum, commonly known as Jordanian goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family, and its leaves are trifoliate with serrated margins. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates.</p>
