                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. microstachys</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. microstachys, commonly known as silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it visually appealing. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often more compact than those of the typical Dactylis glomerata. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in forage and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
