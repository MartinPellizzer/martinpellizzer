<p>Dryopteris brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that adds ornamental value to gardens. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and is often found in forest understories.</p>
