                    <h1>Dryopteris neolepidopoda</h1>
<p>Dryopteris neolepidopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
