<p>Delosperma carterae, commonly known as Carter's ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via runners make it an excellent ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
