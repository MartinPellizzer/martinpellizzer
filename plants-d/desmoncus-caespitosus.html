                    <h1>Desmoncus caespitosus</h1>
<p>Desmoncus caespitosus, commonly known as the hairy cup-lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, velvety thallus covered in short, upright hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, typical of lichens. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
