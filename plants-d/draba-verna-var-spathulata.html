<p>Draba verna var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 5â€“15 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a raceme, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Draba verna.</p>
