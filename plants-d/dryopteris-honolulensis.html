                    <h1>Dryopteris honolulensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris honolulensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian shield fern, is a unique species native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
