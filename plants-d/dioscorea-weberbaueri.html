<p>Dioscorea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yams but are less commonly cultivated for food.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
