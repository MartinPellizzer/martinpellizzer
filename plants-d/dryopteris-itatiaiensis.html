                    <h1>Dryopteris itatiaiensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
