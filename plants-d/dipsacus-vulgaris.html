<p>Dipsacus vulgaris, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a hollow, ridged stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with purple or red markings. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Dipsacus vulgaris is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is toxic if ingested.</p>
