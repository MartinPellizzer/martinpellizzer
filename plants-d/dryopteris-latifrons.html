<p>Dryopteris latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and horizontal, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
