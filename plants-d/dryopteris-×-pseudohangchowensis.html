                    <h1>Dryopteris × pseudohangchowensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × pseudohangchowensis, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris hancockii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a pale green to silvery hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>While it does not produce spores, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add a touch of elegance to shaded gardens.</p>
