                    <h1>Deparia wilsonii var. muliensis</h1>
<p>Deparia wilsonii var. muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis shield fern, is a variant of the Wilson's shield fern native to specific regions in China.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
