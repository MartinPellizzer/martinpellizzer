                    <h1>Distimake nervosus</h1>
<p>Distimake nervosus, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a delicate herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by clusters of spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are sensitive to touch, often curling slightly when handled, which contributes to its common name.</p>
