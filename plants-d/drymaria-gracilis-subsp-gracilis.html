<p>Drymaria gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
