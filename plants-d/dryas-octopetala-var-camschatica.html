                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. camschatica</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. camschatica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with silver-green foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, making it a common species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
