<p>Dolia eremobia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dolia eremobia plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
