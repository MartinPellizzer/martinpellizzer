                    <h1>Dryopteris ligulata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
