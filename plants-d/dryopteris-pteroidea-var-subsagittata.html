                    <h1>Dryopteris pteroidea var. subsagittata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pteroidea var. subsagittata, commonly known as the sagittate wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Dryopteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arrowhead-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are wiry and branched, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
