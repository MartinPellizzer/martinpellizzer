<p>Delphinium peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Delphinium peregrinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value but is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>
