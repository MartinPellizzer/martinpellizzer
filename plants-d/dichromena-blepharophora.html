<p>Dichromena blepharophora, commonly known as the silverleaf dichromena, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and clusters of blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often humid habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
