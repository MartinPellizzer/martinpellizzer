<p>Didymoglossum sublimbatum, commonly known as the mountain moss, is a small, cushion-forming moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green to reddish-brown foliage, which often turns reddish in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are typically arranged in clusters on the stems. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it forms dense mats on soil and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum sublimbatum is an important pioneer species in harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
