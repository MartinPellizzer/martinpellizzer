<p>Delphinium pycnocentrum var. lankongense, commonly known as the Lankong denseleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, with a dense, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
