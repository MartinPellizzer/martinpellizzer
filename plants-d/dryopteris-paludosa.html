                    <h1>Dryopteris paludosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris paludosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
