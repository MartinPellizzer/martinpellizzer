<p>Deparia ludingensis, commonly known as the Luding fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a finely textured appearance.</p>
