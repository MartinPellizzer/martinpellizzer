<p>Dryopteris phaeostigma, commonly known as the black-stained wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a bluish-green or blackish hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
