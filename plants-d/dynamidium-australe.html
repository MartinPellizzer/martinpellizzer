                    <h1>Dynamidium australe</h1>
<p>Dynamidium australe, commonly known as the Australian star moss, is a small, terrestrial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils near the coast. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the dense foliage, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dynamidium australe plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
