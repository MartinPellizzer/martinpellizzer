                    <h1>Drosera margaritacea</h1>
<p>Drosera margaritacea, commonly known as the dewy rose or the silver leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions that give it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Drosera margaritacea is known for its ability to photosynthesize and supplement its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
