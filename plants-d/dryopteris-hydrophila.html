                    <h1>Dryopteris hydrophila</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hydrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green and slightly curled. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to flourish in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
