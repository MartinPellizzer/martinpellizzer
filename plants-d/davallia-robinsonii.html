<p>Davallia robinsonii, commonly known as the fern moss or the walking fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a velvety texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
