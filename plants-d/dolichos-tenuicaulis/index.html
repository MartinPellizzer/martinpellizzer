                            <h1>Dolichos Tenuicaulis</h1>
<p>Small cowpea, scientifically known as Dolichos tenuicaulis, is a lesser-known legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is characterized by its slender stems, small leaves, and compact clusters of pale yellow flowers. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in traditional agriculture and local diets. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial companion plant. Due to its resilience and nutritional value, it is gaining attention as a potential crop for sustainable farming practices.</p>
