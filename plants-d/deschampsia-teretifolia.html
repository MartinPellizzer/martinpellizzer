<p>Deschampsia teretifolia, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
