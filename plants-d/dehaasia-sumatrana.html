<p>Dehaasia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Dehaasia sumatrana is considered threatened and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
