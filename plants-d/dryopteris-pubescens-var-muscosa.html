                    <h1>Dryopteris pubescens var. muscosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pubescens var. muscosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
