<p>Dendrobium × edithae, commonly known as the Edith's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in various colors, including white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × edithae is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
