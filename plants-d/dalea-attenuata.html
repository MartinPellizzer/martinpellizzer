<p>Dalea attenuata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Dalea attenuata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
