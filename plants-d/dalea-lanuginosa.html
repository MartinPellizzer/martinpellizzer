                    <h1>Dalea lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Dalea lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pink to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Dalea lanuginosa is a perennial legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
