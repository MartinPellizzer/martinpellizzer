<p>Disciphania coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf disciphania, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
