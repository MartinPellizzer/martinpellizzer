                    <h1>Diplazium × toriianum</h1>
<p>Diplazium × toriianum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriolosum.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
