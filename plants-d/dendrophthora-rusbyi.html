                    <h1>Dendrophthora rusbyi</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora rusbyi, commonly known as the rusty bark fungus, is a species of basidiomycete fungus found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown to rust-colored cap and stem, which are often covered in fine, fibrous textures. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in humid environments, and plays a role in the decomposition process. Its fruiting bodies are usually small to medium in size and can be found on both living and dead trees.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora rusbyi is of interest to mycologists due to its unique coloration and ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
