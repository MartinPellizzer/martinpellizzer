                    <h1>Dryopteris abyssi</h1>
<p>Dryopteris abyssi, commonly known as the abyss fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of other shield ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
