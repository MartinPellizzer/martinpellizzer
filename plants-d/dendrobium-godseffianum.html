                    <h1>Dendrobium godseffianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium godseffianum, commonly known as the Godseff's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or brown markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
