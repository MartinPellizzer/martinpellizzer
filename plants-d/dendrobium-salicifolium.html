<p>Dendrobium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, pendulous stems covered in clusters of lance-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium salicifolium thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
