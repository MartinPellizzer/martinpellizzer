<p>Dendrobium quadricolor, commonly known as the four-color orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with short, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are striking, with four distinct color zones on each petal, typically in shades of white, yellow, pink, and red.</p>
<p>Dendrobium quadricolor is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
