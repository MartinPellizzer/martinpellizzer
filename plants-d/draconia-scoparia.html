                    <h1>Draconia scoparia</h1>
<p>Draconia scoparia, commonly known as the creeping dragon's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe and North Africa, Draconia scoparia is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats.</p>
