                    <h1>Dryopteris mauritiana var. gardneri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris mauritiana var. gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
