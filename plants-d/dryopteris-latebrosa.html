                    <h1>Dryopteris latebrosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris latebrosa, commonly known as the latebrook wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
