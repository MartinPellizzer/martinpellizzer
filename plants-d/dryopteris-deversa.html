                    <h1>Dryopteris deversa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris deversa, commonly known as the Devers' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory.</p>
