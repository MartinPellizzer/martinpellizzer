<p>Diplazium repens, commonly known as running staghorn fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into segments, with the upper portion resembling a staghorn due to its shape and texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
