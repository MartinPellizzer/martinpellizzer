<p>Dicrocaulon spissum, commonly known as the hairy bracted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, white flowers that are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Dicrocaulon spissum is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
