<p>Digitaria sanguinalis var. multinervis, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a resilient forage plant.</p>
