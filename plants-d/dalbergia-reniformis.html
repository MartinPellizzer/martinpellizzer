                    <h1>Dalbergia reniformis</h1>
<p>Dalbergia reniformis, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
