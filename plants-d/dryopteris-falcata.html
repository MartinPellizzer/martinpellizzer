<p>Dryopteris falcata, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically arched or sickle-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
