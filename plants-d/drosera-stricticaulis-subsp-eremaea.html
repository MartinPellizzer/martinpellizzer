<p>Drosera stricticaulis subsp.</p>
<p>eremaea, commonly known as the spinous sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilage to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hair-like structures that enhance its ability to capture prey.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its resilience and unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
