                    <h1>Dendrocolla pallida</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, white, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack a strong scent, which is unusual for orchids.</p>
<p>Dendrocolla pallida is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
