<p>Digitaria grass, scientifically known as Digitaria vaginata, is a widespread grass species found in various habitats across tropical and subtropical regions. This perennial plant is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and distinctive seed heads that often resemble a sheath, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, Digitaria vaginata plays an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems. Its resilience and versatility make it a subject of interest for researchers and land managers alike.</p>
