<p>Dryopteris austriaca subsp.</p>
<p>euspinulosa, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a fern species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in spore-bearing clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
