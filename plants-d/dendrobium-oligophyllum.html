<p>Dendrobium oligophyllum, commonly known as the orchid with the fewest leaves, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of few, elongated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
