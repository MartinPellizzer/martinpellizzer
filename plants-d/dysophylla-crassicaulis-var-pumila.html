                    <h1>Dysophylla crassicaulis var. pumila</h1>
<p>Dysophylla crassicaulis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This variant is typically found in wet, nutrient-poor soils or waterlogged environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in conditions where traditional plant nutrients are scarce.</p>
