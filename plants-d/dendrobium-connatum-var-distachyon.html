                    <h1>Dendrobium connatum var. distachyon</h1>
<p>Dendrobium connatum var. distachyon, commonly known as the orchid with the distinctive two-branched inflorescence, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
