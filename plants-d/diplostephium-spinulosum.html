<p>Diplostephium spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny false arum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features dark green, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>The spiny structures on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
