<p>Dryopteris sacholepis, commonly known as the Bhutanese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high elevations. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
