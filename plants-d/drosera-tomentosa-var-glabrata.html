                    <h1>Drosera tomentosa var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Drosera tomentosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-tomentose sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or reddish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is less hairy than the typical Drosera tomentosa, giving it its distinguishing name.</p>
