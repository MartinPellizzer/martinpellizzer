                    <h1>Dictyogramme hederifolia</h1>
<p>Dictyogramme hederifolia, commonly known as the common water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the water for anchorage. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's delicate appearance makes it both an ecological indicator species and a popular choice for ornamental water gardens.</p>
