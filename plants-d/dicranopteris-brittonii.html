<p>Dicranopteris brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris brittonii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
