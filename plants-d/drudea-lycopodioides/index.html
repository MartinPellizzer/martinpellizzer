                            <h1>Drudea Lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Lycopodium clubmoss, scientifically known as Drudea lycopodioides, is a small, primitive plant that has thrived for over 400 million years. It belongs to the order Lycopodiales and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. This ancient species is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and leaf-like structures called microphylls. Despite its appearance, it is not a true moss but a vascular plant with a unique reproductive system. Its resilience and evolutionary significance make it an important subject in botanical studies.</p>
