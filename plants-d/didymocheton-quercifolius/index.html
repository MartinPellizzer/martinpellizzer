<p>Corkwood, scientifically known as Didymocheton quercifolius, is a remarkable tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. This unique species is characterized by its thick, cork-like bark and broad, oak-like leaves. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and riverine areas. The tree has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of durable timber. Its ecological and cultural significance makes it an important subject of study and conservation.</p>
