                    <h1>Dryopteris × gotenbaensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × gotenbaensis, commonly known as the Gotenba fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized, evergreen fern characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds with a distinctive pale midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to Japan. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-bearing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
