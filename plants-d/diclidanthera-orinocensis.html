<p>Diclidanthera orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco diclidanthera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
