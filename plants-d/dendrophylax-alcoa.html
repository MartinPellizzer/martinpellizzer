<p>Dendrophylax alcoa, commonly known as the Alcoa's air plant, is a type of orchid that belongs to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of strap-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the summer months.</p>
