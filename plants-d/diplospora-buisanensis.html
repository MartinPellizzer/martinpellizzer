                    <h1>Diplospora buisanensis</h1>
<p>Diplospora buisanensis, commonly known as the Buisan dwarf lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, tightly packed thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark and wood surfaces in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's morphology includes a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, more leathery lower surface. It lacks distinct lobes but has a compact, crust-like structure that adheres closely to its substrate.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
