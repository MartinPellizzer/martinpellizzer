<p>Deutzia heterotricha, commonly known as the Chinese deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges.
