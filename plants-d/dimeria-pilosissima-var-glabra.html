                    <h1>Dimeria pilosissima var. glabra</h1>
<p>Dimeria pilosissima var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth dimeria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other related species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in inflorescences that produce abundant seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its lack of pubescence, making it easily identifiable in botanical studies.</p>
