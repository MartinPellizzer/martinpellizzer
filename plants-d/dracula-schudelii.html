                    <h1>Dracula schudelii</h1>
<p>Dracula schudelii, commonly known as the Schudel's dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous flower spikes that bear numerous small, dark red to purple flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracula schudelii is considered endangered and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
