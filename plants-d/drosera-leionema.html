<p>Drosera leionema, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a dark green color and prominent red or orange veins. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Drosera leionema is known for its ability to digest trapped insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
