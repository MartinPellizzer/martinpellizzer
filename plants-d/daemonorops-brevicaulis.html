<p>Daemonorops brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
