<p>Dryopteris mollicoma, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
