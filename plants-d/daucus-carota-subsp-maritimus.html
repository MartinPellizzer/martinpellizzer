<p>Daucus carota subsp.</p>
<p>maritimus, commonly known as sea carrot, is a subspecies of the carrot that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Its roots are usually smaller and less fleshy compared to the common carrot, adapted to the harsh maritime conditions.</p>
