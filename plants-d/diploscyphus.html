<p>Diploscyphus, commonly known as the twin-lobed cup fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their distinctive cup-shaped or bowl-like basidiocarps, which often have a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. They are typically found in temperate regions, growing on decaying wood or soil. The spore-bearing surface, or gleba, is usually pale to reddish in color.</p>
<p>Diploscyphus species play an important role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
