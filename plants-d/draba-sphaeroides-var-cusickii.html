<p>Draba sphaeroides var. cusickii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and cruciform petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and pale yellow flowers make it well adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its spherical seed pods and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
