                    <h1>Dendrobium theionochilum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium theionochilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which bloom during the dry season. It has long, wiry stems that can store water, aiding its survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss and thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
