<p>Dalbergia aturensis, commonly known as the Guianese rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Dalbergia aturensis is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, which enhances soil fertility.</p>
