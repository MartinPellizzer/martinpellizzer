                    <h1>Dryopteris tyrrhena</h1>
<p>Dryopteris tyrrhena, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems.</p>
