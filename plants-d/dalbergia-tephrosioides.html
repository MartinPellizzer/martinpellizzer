<p>Dalbergia tephrosioides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces small, elongated pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts.</p>
