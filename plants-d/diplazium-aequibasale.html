                    <h1>Diplazium aequibasale</h1>
<p>Diplazium aequibasale, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into pinnae with a distinctive basal lobing, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
