                    <h1>Deparia liangshanensis var. sericea</h1>
<p>Deparia liangshanensis var. sericea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a rare variant of the broadleaf fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
