<p>Dactylorchis occidentalis, commonly known as the western dactyl orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
