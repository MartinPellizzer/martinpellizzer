<p>Desmanthus pratorum, commonly known as the prairie burrplant, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
