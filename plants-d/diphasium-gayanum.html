                    <h1>Diphasium gayanum</h1>
<p>Diphasium gayanum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan dichotomous plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are opposite, elliptic, and have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diphasium gayanum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment.</p>
