                    <h1>Dryopteris densisora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris densisora, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
