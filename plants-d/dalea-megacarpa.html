<p>Dalea megacarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the United States, particularly found in the Great Basin and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Dalea megacarpa thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
