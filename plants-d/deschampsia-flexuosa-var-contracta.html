<p>Deschampsia flexuosa var. contracta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It features fine, tufted blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height, with a dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of many ecological communities.</p>
