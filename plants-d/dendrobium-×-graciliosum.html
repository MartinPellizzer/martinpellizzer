<p>Dendrobium × graciliosum, commonly known as the slender phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink with a fragrant scent. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × graciliosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
