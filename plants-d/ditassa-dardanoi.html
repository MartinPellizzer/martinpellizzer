                    <h1>Ditassa dardanoi</h1>
<p>Ditassa dardanoi, commonly known as the Dardanian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
