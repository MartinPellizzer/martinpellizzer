<p>Diospyros ferrea f. wailauensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian persimmon, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
