                    <h1>Declieuxia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Declieuxia sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass tree, is a distinctive plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, a feature common in sclerophyllous plants. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Declieuxia sclerophylla is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with a deep root system that allows it to regenerate after bushfires.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the coastal and dry forest ecosystems of southeastern Australia.</p>
