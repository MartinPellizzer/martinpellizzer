<p>Daviesia nudiflora subsp.</p>
<p>drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's leafless daviesia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by nectar-feeding insects, and it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced foliage and specific geographic distribution within the broader Daviesia species.</p>
