<p>Dolichos amoenus, commonly known as the beautiful bean or the ornamental cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender pods and showy, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Dolichos amoenus is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible beans, though the pods can be consumed in some regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
