<p>Drosera annua, commonly known as the annual sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems covered in sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it completes its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Drosera annua is valued for its unique adaptations and is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in carnivorous plants.</p>
