                    <h1>Dracula mendozae</h1>
<p>Dracula mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, almost skeletal appearance with long, thin leaves and delicate, pendulous flowers. The plant's unique morphology, including its fleshy, red-tinged roots, is adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in high-altitude environments with consistent moisture and dappled sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Dracula mendozae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
