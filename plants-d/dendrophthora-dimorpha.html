                    <h1>Dendrophthora dimorpha</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has two distinct morphological forms: a leafy, photosynthetic phase and a fruiting, non-photosynthetic phase. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
