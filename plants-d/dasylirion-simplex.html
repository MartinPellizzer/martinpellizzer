<p>Dasylirion simplex, commonly known as the desert dagger, is a striking evergreen plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
