<p>Diplocaulobium tipula, commonly known as the slender-winged gall midge, is a small insect that belongs to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated body and wings that are often transparent or lightly pigmented. The plant it interacts with is typically a species of grass, where it induces the formation of galls on the stems or leaves. These galls serve as protective structures for the developing larvae, providing both shelter and nutrients.</p>
<p>While not a plant itself, this insect plays a role in the ecological dynamics of grassland ecosystems.</p>
