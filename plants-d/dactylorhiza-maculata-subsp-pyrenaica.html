<p>Dactylorhiza maculata subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and mountainous regions. It has a short, creeping rhizome and is adapted to the specific microclimatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
