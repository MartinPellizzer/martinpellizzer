<p>Dactylorhiza cordigera subsp.</p>
<p>siculorum, commonly known as the Sicilian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily and parts of Italy. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, often in marshy or boggy habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has linear, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity in its native wetland environments.</p>
