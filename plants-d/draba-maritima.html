<p>Draba maritima, commonly known as sea saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along shorelines. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Draba maritima is adapted to harsh maritime conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
