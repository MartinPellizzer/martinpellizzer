<p>Dendrobium cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged spirally around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cylindricum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
