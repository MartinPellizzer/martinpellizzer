                    <h1>Dryopteris modesta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris modesta, commonly known as the modest wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, specialized structures called sorus.</p>
