<p>Diplazium marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure with a distinctive, segmented rachis. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that help it colonize moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are embedded in the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diplazium marojejyense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss.</p>
