                    <h1>Dichostylis fluitans</h1>
<p>Dichostylis fluitans, commonly known as the floating dichostylis, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help in water retention. The plant produces two types of flowers—sterile and fertile—on separate stems, a feature known as dichogamy. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
