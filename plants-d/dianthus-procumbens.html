<p>Dianthus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals arranged in a delicate, clustered pattern. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it survive in dry, rocky environments. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a profusion of flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Dianthus procumbens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
