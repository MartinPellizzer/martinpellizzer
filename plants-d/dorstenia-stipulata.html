<p>Dorstenia stipulata, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a tropical species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, curling leaf tendrils that resemble butterfly wings, which help it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture and are often adorned with stipules, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Dorstenia stipulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
