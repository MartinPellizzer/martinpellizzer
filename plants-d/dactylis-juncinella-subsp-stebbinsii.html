<p>Dactylis juncinella subsp.</p>
<p>stebbinsii, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the nominate form of Dactylis juncinella.</p>
