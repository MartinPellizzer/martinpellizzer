<p>Dodonaea vestita var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky hop bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, elliptical, and often have a bluish-green hue when young. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and erosion control capabilities.</p>
