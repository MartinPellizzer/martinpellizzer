<p>It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony trees, and is characterized by its rough, dark bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a smooth, orange-red berry that matures in late summer and is edible, though it has astringent properties when unripe.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its timber, which is dense and durable, and for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
