<p>Draba thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Draba thomsonii is also known for its ability to survive in cold climates and is often found at elevations above 6,000 feet.</p>
