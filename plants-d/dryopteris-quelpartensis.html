                    <h1>Dryopteris quelpartensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris quelpartensis, commonly known as the Quelpart shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
