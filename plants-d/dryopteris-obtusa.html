                    <h1>Dryopteris obtusa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris obtusa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.</p>
