<p>Dissotis controversa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed sites.</p>
