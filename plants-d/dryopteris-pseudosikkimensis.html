<p>Dryopteris pseudosikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
