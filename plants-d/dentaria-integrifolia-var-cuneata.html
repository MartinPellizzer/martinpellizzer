                    <h1>Dentaria integrifolia var. cuneata</h1>
<p>Dentaria integrifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a tight cluster. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fleshy and adapted for storing nutrients, which helps it survive in shaded, moist woodland environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Dentaria integrifolia.</p>
