                    <h1>Dryopteris moulmaynensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris moulmaynensis, commonly known as the Moulmayn shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
