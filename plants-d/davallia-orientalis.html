<p>Davallia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental hartiya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
