<p>Drosera bulbosa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, and it produces a single seed capsule that disperses its seeds.</p>
<p>Drosera bulbosa is a hardy plant that can survive in poor soil conditions due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition.</p>
