                    <h1>Dichaea coriacea</h1>
<p>Dichaea coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the wet season. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Dichaea coriacea is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental qualities.</p>
