                    <h1>Daphne cneorum var. striata</h1>
<p>Daphne cneorum var. striata, commonly known as the striped spurge laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale green stripes running along the midribs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
