<p>Dryopteris sprengelii var. mollipilosa, commonly known as the soft-hairy wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
