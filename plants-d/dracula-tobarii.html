                    <h1>Dracula tobarii</h1>
<p>Dracula tobarii, commonly known as the "bat plant," is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark red or purple flowers that resemble the wings of a bat, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. Dracula tobarii thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing on trees in the understory of dense rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its role as an indicator species for cloud forest ecosystems.</p>
