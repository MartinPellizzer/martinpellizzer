                    <h1>Dracula presbys</h1>
<p>Dracula presbys, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers that resemble the appearance of a bat or a vampire, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure with long, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in the shaded, humid conditions of its habitat. Dracula presbys is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
