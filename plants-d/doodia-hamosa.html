<p>Doodia hamosa, commonly known as the common water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to various regions in Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to submerged substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Doodia hamosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
