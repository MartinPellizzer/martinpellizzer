                    <h1>Deyeuxia forsteri var. micrathera</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia forsteri var. micrathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across moist soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
