                    <h1>Dryopteris semipinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris semipinnata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender, unbranched sterile frond that is often covered in a dense, brownish-red fuzzy layer, giving it its common name. The fertile fronds are shorter and have a more delicate, feathery appearance, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the underside. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique visual characteristics.</p>
