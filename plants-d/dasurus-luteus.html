                    <h1>Dasurus luteus</h1>
<p>Dasurus luteus, commonly known as the yellow-backed ground squirrel, is a small rodent native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, long tail, and distinctive yellowish fur on its back. The plant in question, however, does not exist; Dasurus luteus is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
