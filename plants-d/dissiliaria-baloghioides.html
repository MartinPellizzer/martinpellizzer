<p>Dissiliaria baloghioides, commonly known as the Balogh's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often resembling a ghostly apparition due to their ethereal form.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
