                    <h1>Dracunculus polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Dracunculus polyphyllus, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-like compound leaves and large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the wild. Its stems are covered in soft, hairy structures and emit a strong scent when crushed.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
