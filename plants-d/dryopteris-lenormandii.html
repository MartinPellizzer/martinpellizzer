                    <h1>Dryopteris lenormandii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
