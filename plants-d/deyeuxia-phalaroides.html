<p>Deyeuxia phalaroides, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, a common feature among grasses. Deyeuxia phalaroides is often found in moist soils, such as those in wet meadows or along streambanks, and is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate to high water availability.</p>
