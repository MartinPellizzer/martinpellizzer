                    <h1>Diaxulon argenteum</h1>
<p>Diaxulon argenteum, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and star-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that reflects sunlight, aiding in water conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Diaxulon argenteum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
