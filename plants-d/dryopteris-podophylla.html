<p>Dryopteris podophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick rhizome with a dense crown of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad, and slightly curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
