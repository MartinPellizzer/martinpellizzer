                    <h1>Drosera longifolia var. caulescens</h1>
<p>Drosera longifolia var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or swampy environments where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from captured prey. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more elongated growth form compared to the typical Drosera longifolia.</p>
