                    <h1>Dryopteris wakefieldii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green color and a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
