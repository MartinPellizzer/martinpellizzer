<p>Dactylorhiza sesquipedalis, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
