<p>Draconanthes ecuadoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian dragon fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draconanthes ecuadoriana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
