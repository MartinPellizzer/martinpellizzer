                    <h1>Dioicodendron</h1>
<p>Dioicodendron, commonly known as the whitebeard tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
