                    <h1>Drosera roraimae</h1>
<p>Drosera roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it forms dense rosettes of bright green leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Drosera genus.</p>
