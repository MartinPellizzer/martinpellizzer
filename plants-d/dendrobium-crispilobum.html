<p>Dendrobium crispilobum, commonly known as the wrinkled-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, and its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow lips. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium crispilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
