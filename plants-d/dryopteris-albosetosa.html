                    <h1>Dryopteris albosetosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris albosetosa, commonly known as the white-hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
