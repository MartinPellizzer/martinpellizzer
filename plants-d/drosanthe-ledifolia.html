<p>Drosanthe ledifolia, commonly known as the coastal daisy or rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Drosanthe ledifolia is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
