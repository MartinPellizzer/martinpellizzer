<p>Desmodium venustulum, commonly known as the velvetleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields.</p>
<p>Desmodium venustulum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
