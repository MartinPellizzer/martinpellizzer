<p>Diaperia multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered diaperwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with multiple stems arising from a central caudex. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are linear with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Diaperia multicaulis is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
