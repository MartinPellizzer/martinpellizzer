<p>Dacrydium balansae, commonly known as the New Caledonian pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, mountainous regions with acidic soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the unique biodiversity of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specialization, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
