                    <h1>Dendrobium vitellinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium vitellinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium vitellinum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
