                    <h1>Dryopteris diversiloba subvar. rhombea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris diversiloba subvar. rhombea, commonly known as the rhomboid wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive rhomboid shape that gives the subvariety its name. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia.</p>
<p>It is often found in coniferous forests and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
