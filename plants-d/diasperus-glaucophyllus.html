<p>Diasperus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the blue-leafed spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, further aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Diasperus glaucophyllus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
