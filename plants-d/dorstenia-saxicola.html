<p>Dorstenia saxicola, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a unique member of the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that often appear to be parasitic, though it is not a true parasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
