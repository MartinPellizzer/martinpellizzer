                    <h1>Diostea scoparia var. subulata</h1>
<p>Diostea scoparia var. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diostea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
