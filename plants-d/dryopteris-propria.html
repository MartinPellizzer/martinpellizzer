                    <h1>Dryopteris propria</h1>
<p>Dryopteris propria, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
