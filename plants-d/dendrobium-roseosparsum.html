<p>Dendrobium roseosparsum, commonly known as the rose-spurred orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a branching stem system and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation.</p>
<p>Dendrobium roseosparsum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
