                    <h1>Duggena leptantha</h1>
<p>Duggena leptantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved duggena, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in parts of Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
