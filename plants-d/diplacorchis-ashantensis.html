<p>Diplacorchis ashantensis, commonly known as the Ashanti orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and lanceolate leaves, adapted to its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Diplacorchis ashantensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
