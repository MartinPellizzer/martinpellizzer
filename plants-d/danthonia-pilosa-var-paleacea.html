                    <h1>Danthonia pilosa var. paleacea</h1>
<p>Danthonia pilosa var. paleacea, commonly known as pale beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
