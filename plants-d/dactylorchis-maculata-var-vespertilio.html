<p>Dactylorchis maculata var. vespertilio, commonly known as the evening orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers with white markings, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single flower at the apex. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>This orchid is pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to its evening blooming pattern.</p>
