The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants.</p>
<p>Deprea peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience.</p>
