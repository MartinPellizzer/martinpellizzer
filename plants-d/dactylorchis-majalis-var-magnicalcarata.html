                    <h1>Dactylorchis majalis var. magnicalcarata</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis majalis var. magnicalcarata, commonly known as the giant spurred orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its large, showy flowers with prominent spurred petals and a vibrant coloration that ranges from purple to pink. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
