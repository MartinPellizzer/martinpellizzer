                    <h1>Dryopteris purdomii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
