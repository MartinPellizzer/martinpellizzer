<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp.</p>
<p>hibernica, commonly known as the Irish bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in acidic, moist habitats such as peat bogs and heaths, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
