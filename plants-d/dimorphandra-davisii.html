<p>Dimorphandra davisii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands and savannas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation efforts.</p>
