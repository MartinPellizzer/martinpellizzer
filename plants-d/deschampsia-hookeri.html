<p>Deschampsia hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a light, airy appearance to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Deschampsia hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
