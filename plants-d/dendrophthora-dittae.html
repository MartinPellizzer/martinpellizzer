                    <h1>Dendrophthora dittae</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora dittae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in the moist, shaded environments of pine flatwoods and scrub habitats, often growing on the trunks of live oaks. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
