                    <h1>Dryopteris hondoensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hondoensis, commonly known as Hondo brake fern, is a species of fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
