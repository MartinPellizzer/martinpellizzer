                    <h1>Dianthus crassipes</h1>
<p>Dianthus crassipes, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or reddish-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dianthus crassipes is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
