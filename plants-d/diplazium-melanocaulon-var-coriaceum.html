                    <h1>Diplazium melanocaulon var. coriaceum</h1>
<p>Diplazium melanocaulon var. coriaceum, commonly known as the coriaceous shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
