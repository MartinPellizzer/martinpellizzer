                    <h1>Dryopteris sorbifolia var. confertivenosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sorbifolia var. confertivenosa, commonly known as the dense-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the sorbifolia fern species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are densely packed, giving it a lush appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
