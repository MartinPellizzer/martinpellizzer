<p>Dolichothele baumii, commonly known as the Baum's long-tongued spider.</p>
<p>It is a species of orb-weaving spider found primarily in Southeast Asia. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a spider, so its botanical aspects are not applicable. The spider is known for its long, slender legs and its ability to construct intricate webs.</p>
<p>It plays a role in controlling insect populations in its native habitat.</p>
