<p>Draba turgida subsp.</p>
<p>eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the presence of the dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the species.</p>
