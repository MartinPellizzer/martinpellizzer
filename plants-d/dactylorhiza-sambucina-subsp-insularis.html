<p>Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form, typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, dense spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are grass-like, linear, and often clustered at the base.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact inflorescence compared to the broader form of *D. sambucina*.</p>
