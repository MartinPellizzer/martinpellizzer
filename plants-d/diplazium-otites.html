<p>Diplazium otites, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium otites is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
