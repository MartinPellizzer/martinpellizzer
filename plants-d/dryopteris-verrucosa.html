                    <h1>Dryopteris verrucosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, with each pinna bearing small, toothed segments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective flap.</p>
