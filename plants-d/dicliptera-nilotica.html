                    <h1>Dicliptera nilotica</h1>
<p>Dicliptera nilotica, commonly known as the Nile grass or river grass, is a perennial herb native to Africa, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Dicliptera nilotica plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
