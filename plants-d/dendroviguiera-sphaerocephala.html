                    <h1>Dendroviguiera sphaerocephala</h1>
<p>Dendroviguiera sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
