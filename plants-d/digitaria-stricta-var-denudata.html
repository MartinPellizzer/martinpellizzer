<p>Digitaria stricta var. denudata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in pastures.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
