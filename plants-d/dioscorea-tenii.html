                    <h1>Dioscorea tenii</h1>
<p>Dioscorea tenii, commonly known as the African yam, is a climbing vine belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into tuberous roots, which are its primary edible part. Dioscorea tenii is valued for its starchy tubers, which are a traditional food source in many African communities.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and morphology make it an important species in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies.</p>
