                    <h1>Drosera serpens</h1>
<p>Drosera serpens, commonly known as the snake plant or spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves that curl around prey. The leaves are covered in sticky glands that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soil and requires a humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
