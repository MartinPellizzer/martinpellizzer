                    <h1>Dendrophthora rubicunda</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora rubicunda, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries, which are typically red, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
