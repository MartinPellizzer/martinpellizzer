                    <h1>Diaphananthe bueae</h1>
<p>Diaphananthe bueae, commonly known as the Buea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of West Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are visited by various pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees.</p>
