                    <h1>Discocactus catingicola var. griseus</h1>
<p>Discocactus catingicola var. griseus, commonly known as the gray discocactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The grayish-blue coloration of its stems is due to a waxy coating that helps reflect sunlight and minimize heat absorption.</p>
