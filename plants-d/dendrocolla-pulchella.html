                    <h1>Dendrocolla pulchella</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a unique ability to form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
