<p>Dipterygium glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from its host trees, often leading to weakened or damaged host plants.</p>
