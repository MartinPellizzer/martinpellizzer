                    <h1>Deyeuxia scabrescens var. humilis</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia scabrescens var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rough grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is characterized by its narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
