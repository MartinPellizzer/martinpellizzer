                    <h1>Davilla macroclada</h1>
<p>Davilla macroclada, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. These fruits are edible for some animals but not typically for humans.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and showy fruit display.</p>
