<p>Dillenia ovata, commonly known as the common dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive, woody, egg-shaped fruits. The fruit splits open to reveal several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
