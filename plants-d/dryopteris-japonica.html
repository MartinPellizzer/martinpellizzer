                    <h1>Dryopteris japonica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris japonica, commonly known as Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
