<p>Deschampsia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that appear in late summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Deschampsia mexicana contribute to its ecological value in supporting local wildlife and enhancing biodiversity in native plant gardens.</p>
