<p>Diplazium crenatolobatum, commonly known as the serrated-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into serrated lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are somewhat thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
