<p>Daucus gummifer var. leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaf gumweed, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the gumweed species.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to specific regions of North America, typically found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features slender, alternate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance, which is a feature shared with other members of the Daucus genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
