                    <h1>Dryopteris lugubris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lugubris, commonly known as the sorrowful wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-green in color, with a distinctive, wiry appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spores are released from fertile fronds, which are usually shorter and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
