<p>Dryopteris sparsa subsp.</p>
<p>nitidula, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a slightly curved shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the late summer months.</p>
