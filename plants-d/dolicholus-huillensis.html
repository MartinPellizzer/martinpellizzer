                    <h1>Dolicholus huillensis</h1>
<p>Dolicholus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, rocky soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dolicholus huillensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
