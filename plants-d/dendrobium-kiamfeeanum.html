<p>Dendrobium kiamfeeanum, commonly known as the Kiamfeean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium kiamfeeanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display.</p>
