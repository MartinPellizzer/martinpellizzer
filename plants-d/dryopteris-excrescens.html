                    <h1>Dryopteris excrescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris excrescens, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are dark green with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fern produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
