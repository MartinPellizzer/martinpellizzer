                    <h1>Dopatrium tenerum</h1>
<p>Dopatrium tenerum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but dense, allowing it to thrive in well-drained sandy soils.</p>
<p>Dopatrium tenerum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
