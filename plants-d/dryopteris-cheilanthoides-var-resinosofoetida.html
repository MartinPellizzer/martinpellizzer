                    <h1>Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. resinosofoetida</h1>
<p>Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. resinosofoetida, commonly known as the resinous cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its unique chemical composition, which may contribute to its resistance to herbivores.</p>
