<p>Diplazium schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Diplazium schraderi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
