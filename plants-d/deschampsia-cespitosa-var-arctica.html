<p>Deschampsia cespitosa var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic hair grass, is a perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is highly resistant to cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a characteristic component of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
