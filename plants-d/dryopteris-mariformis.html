                    <h1>Dryopteris mariformis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris mariformis, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a species of fern native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in consistently damp conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
