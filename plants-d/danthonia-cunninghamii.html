                    <h1>Danthonia cunninghamii</h1>
<p>Danthonia cunninghamii, commonly known as the coastal grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
