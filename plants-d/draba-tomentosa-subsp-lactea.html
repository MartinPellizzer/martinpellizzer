<p>Draba tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>lactea, commonly known as the white-tomentose whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ornamental plant for its resilience and delicate appearance.</p>
