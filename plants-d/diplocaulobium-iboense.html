                    <h1>Diplocaulobium iboense</h1>
<p>Diplocaulobium iboense, commonly known as the Iboense fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor role in its ecosystem, contributing to aquatic biodiversity and serving as a food source for certain invertebrates.</p>
