                    <h1>Dalbergia ruddiae</h1>
<p>Dalbergia ruddiae, commonly known as the Malawi rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, velvety pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use.</p>
