                    <h1>Dendrophthoe locellata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe locellata, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which necessitates its parasitic lifestyle. The plant typically grows as a vine, attaching itself to the bark of its host with specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where suitable host trees are present.</p>
