<p>Dominia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its flowers open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Dominia is also valued for its symbolic significance in many cultures and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
