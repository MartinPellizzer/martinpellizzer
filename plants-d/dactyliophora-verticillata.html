<p>Dactyliophora verticillata, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and whorls of leaves arranged in a spiral. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Dactyliophora verticillata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
