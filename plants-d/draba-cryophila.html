<p>Draba cryophila, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season of high-altitude ecosystems. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against cold and desiccation.</p>
<p>Draba cryophila is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
