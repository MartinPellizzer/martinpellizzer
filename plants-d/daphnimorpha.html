                    <h1>Daphnimorpha</h1>
<p>Daphnimorpha, commonly known as the water flea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its transparent, shield-shaped body and the presence of a specialized structure called the lorica, which provides protection. Daphnimorpha species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as primary consumers, feeding on algae and detritus.</p>
<p>Their life cycle includes a rapid reproductive phase known as parthenogenesis, allowing for quick population growth in favorable conditions.</p>
