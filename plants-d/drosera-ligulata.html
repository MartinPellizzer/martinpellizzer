                    <h1>Drosera ligulata</h1>
<p>Drosera ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, rosette-like leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with red or pinkish hues, and they curl around captured prey to aid in digestion. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands, where it absorbs nutrients from the trapped insects.</p>
<p>Drosera ligulata is a perennial species that produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
