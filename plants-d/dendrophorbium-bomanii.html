                    <h1>Dendrophorbium bomanii</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium bomanii, commonly known as the Boman's tree lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is tightly adhered to the substrate, often appearing as a crust or foliose growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for forest health and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
