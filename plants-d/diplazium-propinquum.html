<p>Diplazium propinquum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Diplazium propinquum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
