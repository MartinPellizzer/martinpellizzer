                    <h1>Dendrobium caudiculatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium caudiculatum, commonly known as the orchid with a swollen stem, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Dendrobium caudiculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
