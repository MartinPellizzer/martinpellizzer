<p>Diplazium bradeorum, commonly known as the Brade's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant in the substrate.</p>
<p>Diplazium bradeorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
