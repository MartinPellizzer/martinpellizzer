<p>Dianthus seguieri subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocollinus, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces vibrant pink to red flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, contributing to its resilience in rocky and dry landscapes.</p>
