                    <h1>Daphne laureola var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Daphne laureola var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Daphne laureola. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it requires careful handling.</p>
