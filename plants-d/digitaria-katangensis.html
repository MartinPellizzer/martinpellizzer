<p>Digitaria katangensis, commonly known as Katanga grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Digitaria katangensis is valued for its potential in forage and erosion control in its native habitat.</p>
