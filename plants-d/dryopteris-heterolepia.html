<p>Dryopteris heterolepia, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that vary in size and shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are released from fertile fronds that develop in the late summer, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Dryopteris heterolepia make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
