                    <h1>Desmodium paniculatum var. dillenii</h1>
<p>Desmodium paniculatum var. dillenii, commonly known as the slender desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pea-like flowers in dense, drooping clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant.</p>
