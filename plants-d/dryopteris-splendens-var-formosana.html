                    <h1>Dryopteris splendens var. formosana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris splendens var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan lady fern, is a variant of the elegant lady fern native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern with delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in forest ecosystems.</p>
