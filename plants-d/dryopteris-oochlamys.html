<p>Dryopteris oochlamys, commonly known as the broadleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
