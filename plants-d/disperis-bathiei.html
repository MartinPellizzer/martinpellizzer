                    <h1>Disperis bathiei</h1>
<p>Disperis bathiei, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in woodland areas, preferring partial shade and well-drained conditions. Its unique floral structure includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Disperis bathiei is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
