                    <h1>Dendrophorbium</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology includes small, spore-producing structures called sorangia, which are clustered along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrophorbium is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
