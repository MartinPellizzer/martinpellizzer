<p>Dendrobium septemcostulatum, commonly known as the seven-costed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a green throat. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and covered in a thick, leathery sheath.</p>
<p>Dendrobium septemcostulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
