<p>Dicksonia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' tree fern, is a tall, slender fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that resembles bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The spores are released from cone-like structures called soruses located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
