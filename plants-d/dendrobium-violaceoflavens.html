                    <h1>Dendrobium violaceoflavens</h1>
<p>Dendrobium violaceoflavens, commonly known as the violet-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
