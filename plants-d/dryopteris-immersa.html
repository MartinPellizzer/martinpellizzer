<p>Dryopteris immersa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually pale green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance.</p>
