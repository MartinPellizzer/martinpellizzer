                    <h1>Dryopteris leptogrammoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris leptogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces new growth from its nodes, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize suitable habitats.</p>
