                    <h1>Delabechea</h1>
<p>Delabechea, commonly known as the desert shrub or desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often arranged in clusters. Delabechea species typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them conserve water in harsh environments. They are often used in traditional medicine and are adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>The genus is part of the family Malvaceae, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus.</p>
