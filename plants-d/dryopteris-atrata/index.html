<p>Dryopteris atrata, commonly known as the black knight fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is recognized for its dark, leathery fronds that create a dramatic, almost prehistoric appearance. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and woodland landscapes. With its bold look and hardy nature, it stands out as a versatile and eye-catching plant in the plant world.</p>
