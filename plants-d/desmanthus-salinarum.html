The plant is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a hardy species for xerophytic conditions. Its root system helps in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in harsh landscapes.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
