<p>Davallia luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon hakea, is a rare fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
