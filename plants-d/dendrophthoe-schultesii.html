                    <h1>Dendrophthoe schultesii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on a host tree for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as those in the genus Ficus. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces fleshy, edible fruits that attract birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host relationships.</p>
