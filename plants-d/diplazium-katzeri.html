<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
