<p>Dryopsis sphaeropteroides, commonly known as the globular dryopsis, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical or globular rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
