<p>Dicranopteris warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, and the fronds are usually divided into small, linear segments.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris warburgii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
