                    <h1>Ditassa semirii</h1>
<p>Ditassa semirii, commonly known as the Semirii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using limited leaf surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
