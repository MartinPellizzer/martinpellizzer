                    <h1>Dryopteris decomposita var. angustiloba</h1>
<p>Dryopteris decomposita var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the delicate wood fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in terminal clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
