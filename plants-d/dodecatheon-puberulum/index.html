                            <h1>Dodecatheon Puberulum</h1>
<p>Dodecatheon puberulum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. Known for its striking, bell-shaped blooms, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist soil. This species is often found in rocky woodlands and stream banks, where it forms small, clustered colonies. Its hairy leaves and vibrant pink flowers make it a unique addition to the flora of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
