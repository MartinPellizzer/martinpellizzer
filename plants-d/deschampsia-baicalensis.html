                    <h1>Deschampsia baicalensis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Mongolia and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental grass for its delicate appearance and resilience.</p>
