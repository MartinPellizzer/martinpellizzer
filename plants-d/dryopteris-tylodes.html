<p>Dryopteris tylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fertile fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, retaining their foliage throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
