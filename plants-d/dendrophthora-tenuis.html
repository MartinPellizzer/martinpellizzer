                    <h1>Dendrophthora tenuis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora tenuis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
