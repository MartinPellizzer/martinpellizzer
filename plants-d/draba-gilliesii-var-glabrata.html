                    <h1>Draba gilliesii var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Draba gilliesii var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, basal leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
