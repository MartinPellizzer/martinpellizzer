                    <h1>Dryopteris parvula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parvula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense, low-growing clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris parvula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
