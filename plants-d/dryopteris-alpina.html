                    <h1>Dryopteris alpina</h1>
<p>Dryopteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Dryopteris alpina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
