                    <h1>Diplusodon saxatilis</h1>
<p>Diplusodon saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and exposed environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant forms a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to the substrate, making it difficult to remove. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
