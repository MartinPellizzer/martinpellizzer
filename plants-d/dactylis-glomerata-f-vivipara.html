                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous goatgrass, is a botanical variant of the common goatgrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive feature where the shoots develop directly from the base of the plant, a process known as viviparity. This trait allows it to establish itself more rapidly in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
