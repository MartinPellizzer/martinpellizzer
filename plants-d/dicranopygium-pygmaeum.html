<p>Dicranopygium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant has leafy shoots that are typically less than 2 cm in length, with a narrow, elongated shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are small and often embedded within the dense moss mat.</p>
<p>Dicranopygium pygmaeum plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
