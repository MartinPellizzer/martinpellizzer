                    <h1>Dendrophthoe erecta</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe erecta, commonly known as the erect mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries, which are important for local wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on its host, affecting the host's health over time.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe erecta is found in regions of Australia and is part of the Viscaceae family.</p>
