<p>Diplazium vincentis, commonly known as Vincent's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Diplazium vincentis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
