                    <h1>Deinostema adenocaula</h1>
<p>Deinostema adenocaula, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Deinostema adenocaula plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
