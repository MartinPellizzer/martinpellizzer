<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous thread-like leaflets, and its root system is fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in prairies and open woodlands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
