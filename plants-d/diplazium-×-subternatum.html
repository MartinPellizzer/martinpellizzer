                    <h1>Diplazium × subternatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium × subternatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriodes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium × subternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid climates.</p>
