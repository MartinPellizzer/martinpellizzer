                    <h1>Dryopteris submontana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris submontana, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish strong colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
