                    <h1>Diphyes cryptantha</h1>
<p>Diphyes cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The ghost flower is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
