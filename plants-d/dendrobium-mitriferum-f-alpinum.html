                    <h1>Dendrobium mitriferum f. alpinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium mitriferum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dendrobium, is a rare and unique orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil, and thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features elongated, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to conserve moisture in its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
