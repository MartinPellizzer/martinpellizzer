                    <h1>Doellingeria tomentella</h1>
<p>Doellingeria tomentella, commonly known as the woolly marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of soft, hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fibrous root system aids in stabilizing soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Doellingeria tomentella is typically found in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important indicator species for wetland preservation.</p>
