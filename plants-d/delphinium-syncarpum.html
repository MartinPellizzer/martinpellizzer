<p>Delphinium syncarpum, commonly known as the clustered larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Delphinium syncarpum is valued in gardens for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental qualities.</p>
