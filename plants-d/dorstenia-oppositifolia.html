                    <h1>Dorstenia oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Dorstenia oppositifolia, commonly known as the "arrowleaf" or "devil's tongue," is a unique member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Dorstenia oppositifolia is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
