                <h1>Dryopteris parasitica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic wood fern, is a unique fern species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship with its host plants.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its fronds, making it a hemiparasite. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, delicate appearance that sets it apart from other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
