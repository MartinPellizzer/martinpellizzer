                    <h1>Dioon caputoi</h1>
<p>Dioon caputoi, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a dense crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, spiky, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. Dioon caputoi is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a slow growth rate and long lifespan, which are common traits among cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
