                    <h1>Deschampsia bottnica f. subtriflora</h1>
<p>Deschampsia bottnica f. subtriflora, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
