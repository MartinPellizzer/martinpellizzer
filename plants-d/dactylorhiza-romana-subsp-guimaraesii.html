<p>Dactylorhiza romana subsp.</p>
<p>guimaraesii, commonly known as the Guimar√£es orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Portugal. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to grow in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
