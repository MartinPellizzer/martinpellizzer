                    <h1>Dissolena</h1>
<p>Dissolena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Dissolena typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
