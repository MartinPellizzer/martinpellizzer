                    <h1>Duhaldea revoluta</h1>
<p>Duhaldea revoluta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts.</p>
<p>However, habitat destruction and over-collection have led to a dramatic decline in its population.</p>
