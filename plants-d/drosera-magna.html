<p>Drosera magna, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sticky leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Drosera magna is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
