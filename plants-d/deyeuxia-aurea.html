                    <h1>Deyeuxia aurea</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia aurea, commonly known as golden false rice, is a perennial grass species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense vegetation that can dominate these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
