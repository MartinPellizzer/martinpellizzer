<p>Dendrobium sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sulcatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
