                    <h1>Derris rufescens</h1>
<p>Derris rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed derris, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone, a natural pesticide.</p>
<p>Derris rufescens is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxicity.</p>
