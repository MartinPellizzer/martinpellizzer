                    <h1>Delphinacanthus</h1>
<p>Delphinacanthus, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Delphinacanthus is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
