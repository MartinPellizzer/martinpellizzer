                    <h1>Dryas grandis var. tomentella</h1>
<p>Dryas grandis var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering, which provides insulation and protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
