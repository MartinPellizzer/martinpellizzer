                    <h1>Delostoma lobbii</h1>
<p>Delostoma lobbii, commonly known as the African rain lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in rainforests across Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Delostoma lobbii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
