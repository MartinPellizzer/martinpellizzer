                    <h1>Dryopteris sparsa var. nitidula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sparsa var. nitidula, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy green fronds that are often arching or upright, depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
