<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's male fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology compared to the more widely recognized D. filix-mas.</p>
