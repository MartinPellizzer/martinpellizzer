                    <h1>Dryopteris labordei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris labordei, commonly known as the Laborde's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
