                    <h1>Dendrobium reflexitepalum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium reflexitepalum, commonly known as the reflexed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive reflexed lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
