The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hood-like lip, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
