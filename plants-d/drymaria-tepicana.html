<p>Drymaria tepicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Drymaria tepicana is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
