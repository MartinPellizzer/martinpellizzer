<p>Dichaetanthera scabra, commonly known as the rough anther grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Dichaetanthera scabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
