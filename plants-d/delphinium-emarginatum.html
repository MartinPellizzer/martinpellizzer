<p>Delphinium emarginatum, commonly known as the fringed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers with distinctive fringed petals. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Delphinium emarginatum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to livestock and humans.</p>
