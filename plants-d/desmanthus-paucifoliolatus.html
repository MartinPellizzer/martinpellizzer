                    <h1>Desmanthus paucifoliolatus</h1>
<p>Desmanthus paucifoliolatus, commonly known as the few-leaved desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with few leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
