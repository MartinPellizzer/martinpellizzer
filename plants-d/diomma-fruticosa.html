                    <h1>Diomma fruticosa</h1>
<p>Diomma fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Diomma fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
