                    <h1>Diastella buekii</h1>
<p>Diastella buekii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its unique, showy yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Diastella buekii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and the challenges it presents for cultivation and conservation.</p>
