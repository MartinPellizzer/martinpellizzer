                    <h1>Drosera cucullata</h1>
<p>Drosera cucullata, commonly known as the Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of red or yellow droplets that help in capturing prey.</p>
<p>Drosera cucullata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in controlling insect populations.</p>
