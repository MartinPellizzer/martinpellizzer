                    <h1>Dryopteris bissetiana var. sacrosancta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bissetiana var. sacrosancta, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a varietal form of the Bisset's wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of the fronds, which are typical of fern reproductive structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
