                    <h1>Duvernoia pyramidata</h1>
<p>Duvernoia pyramidata, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage composed of overlapping, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical study.</p>
