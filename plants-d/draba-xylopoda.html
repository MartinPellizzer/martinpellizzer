                    <h1>Draba xylopoda</h1>
<p>Draba xylopoda, commonly known as the wood saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba xylopoda is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
