<p>Diplazium consacense, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Diplazium consacense includes both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
