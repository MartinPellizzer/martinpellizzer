<p>Dactylorhiza × silvae-gabretae subsp.</p>
<p>megapolitana, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and requires consistently moist conditions for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in wetland habitats and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
