<p>Dendrobium repandum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium repandum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
