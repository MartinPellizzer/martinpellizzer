                    <h1>Doria carnosa</h1>
<p>Doria carnosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to dark purple. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Doria carnosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens.</p>
