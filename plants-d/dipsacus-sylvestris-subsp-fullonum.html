<p>Dipsacus sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>fullonum, commonly known as the bristly teasel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique bracts, which are modified leaves, enclose the flower heads and give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in textile production.</p>
