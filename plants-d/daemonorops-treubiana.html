                    <h1>Daemonorops treubiana</h1>
<p>Daemonorops treubiana, commonly known as the Borneo cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones instead of flowers. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
