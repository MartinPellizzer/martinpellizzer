<p>Diplazium incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the water surface.</p>
<p>Diplazium incisum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
