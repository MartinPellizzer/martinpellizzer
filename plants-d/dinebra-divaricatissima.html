                    <h1>Dinebra divaricatissima</h1>
<p>Dinebra divaricatissima, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically attaches itself to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
