<p>Dicksonia pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, pale to dark green, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas.</p>
