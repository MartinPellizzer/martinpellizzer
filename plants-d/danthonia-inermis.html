                    <h1>Danthonia inermis</h1>
<p>Danthonia inermis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
