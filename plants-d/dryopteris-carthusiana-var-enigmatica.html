<p>Dryopteris carthusiana var. enigmatica, commonly known as the enigmatic wood fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate leaves with a unique arrangement of pinnae that set it apart from other members of the Dryopteris genus. The fronds are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance, with a velvety texture on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological adaptability.</p>
