<p>Delphinium leptocarpum, commonly known as the slender-rooted larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy layer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Delphinium leptocarpum is valued in gardens for its striking appearance but is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>
