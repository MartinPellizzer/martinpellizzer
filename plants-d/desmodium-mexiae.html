                    <h1>Desmodium mexiae</h1>
<p>Desmodium mexiae, commonly known as Mexican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing.</p>
<p>Desmodium mexiae is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
