                    <h1>Draba verna var. lucida</h1>
<p>Draba verna var. lucida, commonly known as the shining spring whitlow, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its notably shiny, reflective leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
