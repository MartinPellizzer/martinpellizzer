                    <h1>Dudleya farinosa</h1>
<p>Dudleya farinosa, commonly known as the Desert Carpet Plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates.</p>
