<p>Deyeuxia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia nudiflora is characterized by its lack of leaf sheaths and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
