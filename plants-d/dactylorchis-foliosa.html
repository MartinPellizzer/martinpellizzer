<p>Dactylorchis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with reduced leaves and specialized root systems for nutrient absorption.</p>
