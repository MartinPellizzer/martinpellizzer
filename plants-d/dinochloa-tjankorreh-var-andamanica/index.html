                            <h1>Dinochloa Tjankorreh Var. Andamanica</h1>
<p>Andaman grass, scientifically known as Dinochloa tjankorreh var. andamanica, is a unique and resilient plant native to the tropical regions of the Andaman Islands. This grass species thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing along the shores and in dense, moist undergrowth. Its slender, blade-like leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive feature of the local flora. Despite its modest appearance, Andaman grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been the subject of increasing botanical and conservation interest.</p>
