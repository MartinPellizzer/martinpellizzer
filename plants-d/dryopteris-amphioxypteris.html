                    <h1>Dryopteris amphioxypteris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris amphioxypteris, commonly known as the broad-ovate water fern, is a prehistoric fern that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate-shaped fronds with a distinctive bifurcated structure. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, which allowed it to grow tall and support its massive fronds. Its spores were dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in ancient swampy environments.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the development of early terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
