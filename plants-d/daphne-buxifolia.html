                    <h1>Daphne buxifolia</h1>
<p>Daphne buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage consisting of small, leathery, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
