<p>Dolichos sericeus subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as the silky cowpea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies glabrescens differs from the typical Dolichos sericeus by having a more glabrous (smooth) appearance, particularly on its stems and leaves. It produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings.</p>
