<p>Diplycosia mantorii, commonly known as the Mantorii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Australian eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, yellowish berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
