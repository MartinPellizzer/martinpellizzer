                    <h1>Drymaria conzattii</h1>
<p>Drymaria conzattii, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic landscapes.</p>
