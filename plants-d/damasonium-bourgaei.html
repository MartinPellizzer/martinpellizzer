<p>Damasonium bourgaei, commonly known as the African water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which bloom in early spring. Damasonium bourgaei thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
