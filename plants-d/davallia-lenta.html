<p>Davallia lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, low-growing carpet. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>Davallia lenta is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant.</p>
