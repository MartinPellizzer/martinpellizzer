                    <h1>Drymaria diandra</h1>
<p>Drymaria diandra, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
