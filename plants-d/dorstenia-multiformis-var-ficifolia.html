<p>Dorstenia multiformis var. ficifolia, commonly known as the "fig-leaf plant," is a unique member of the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fig tree.</p>
<p>The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale green, adding a subtle contrast to the foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions.</p>
