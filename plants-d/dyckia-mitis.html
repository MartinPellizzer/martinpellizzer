<p>Dyckia mitis, commonly known as the silver pine or silver feather, is a perennial bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are stiff and covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Dyckia mitis thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
