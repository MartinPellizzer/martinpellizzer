<p>Dortmanna retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-facing moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a simple thalloid structure with a distinct dorsal and ventral surface, and its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules located on the stem.</p>
<p>Dortmanna retrorsa plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
