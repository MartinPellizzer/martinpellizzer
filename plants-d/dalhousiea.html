                    <h1>Dalhousiea</h1>
<p>Dalhousiea, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Dalhousiea species are shrubs that often have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of pink or white flowers. They are adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making them resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The genus is named in honor of the British statesman Lord Dalhousie.</p>
