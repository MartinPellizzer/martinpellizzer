<p>Daucus gingidium subsp.</p>
<p>atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic carrot, is a rare subspecies native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and cliffs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinct umbel shape, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are generally small and not as economically valuable as those of common carrots.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
