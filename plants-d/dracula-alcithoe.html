                    <h1>Dracula alcithoe</h1>
<p>Dracula alcithoe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure, with a short, fleshy stem and broad, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Dracula alcithoe is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
