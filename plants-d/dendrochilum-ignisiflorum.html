                    <h1>Dendrochilum ignisiflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum ignisiflorum, commonly known as the fire-flowered tree orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flame-like inflorescence that gives it its common name, with clusters of bright red and orange flowers resembling flickering flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
