<p>Disciphania inversa, commonly known as the inverted disc lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which consists of a crustose, foliose, and squamulose growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or bark in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Disciphania inversa is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution and environmental changes.</p>
