                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. marquesensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan climbing fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes and slender, pinnately compound fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and possess a distinctive, somewhat leathery texture. This variety is notable for its parasitic tendencies, as it can derive some nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
