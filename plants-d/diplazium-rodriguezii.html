<p>Diplazium rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Diplazium rodriguezii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
