<p>It is characterized by its erect, often sprawling stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
