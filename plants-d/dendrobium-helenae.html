<p>Dendrobium helenae, commonly known as the Helen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blossoms typically range in color from white to pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals.</p>
<p>Dendrobium helenae thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
