                    <h1>Deguelia</h1>
<p>Deguelia, commonly known as the "silk tree" or "silk cotton tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant, flowers that resemble those of the pea family. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pod-like fruits that contain fibrous seeds. Deguelia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>However, some species are considered invasive in certain regions, posing challenges to local ecosystems.</p>
