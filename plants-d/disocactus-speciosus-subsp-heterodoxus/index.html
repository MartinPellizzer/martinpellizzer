<p>Crown of thorns, scientifically known as Disocactus speciosus subsp. heterodoxus, is a striking cactus native to Mexico. It is prized for its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Despite its name, it is not related to the biblical crown of thorns but gets its name from its spiny appearance. This plant is popular among gardeners for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. Its unique look and ease of care make it a favorite in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
