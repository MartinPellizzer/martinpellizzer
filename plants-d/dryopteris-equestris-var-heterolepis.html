                    <h1>Dryopteris equestris var. heterolepis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris equestris var. heterolepis, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a variant of the horse's tail fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens.</p>
