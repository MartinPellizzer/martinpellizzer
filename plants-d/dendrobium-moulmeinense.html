                    <h1>Dendrobium moulmeinense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium moulmeinense, commonly known as the Moulmein orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Dendrobium moulmeinense is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
