<p>Diasperus corcovadensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters.

Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in craftsmanship.</p>
