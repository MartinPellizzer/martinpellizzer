                    <h1>Discaria prostrata var. nana</h1>
<p>Discaria prostrata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf prostrate discaria, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover.</p>
