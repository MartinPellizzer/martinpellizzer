                    <h1>Disocactus biformis</h1>
<p>Disocactus biformis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a fascinating cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for arid environments and container gardening.</p>
