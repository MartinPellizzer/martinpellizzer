                    <h1>Diplazium hammelianum</h1>
<p>Diplazium hammelianum, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Diplazium hammelianum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
