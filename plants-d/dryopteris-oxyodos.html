                    <h1>Dryopteris oxyodos</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oxyodos, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
