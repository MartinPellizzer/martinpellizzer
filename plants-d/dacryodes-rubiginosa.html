                    <h1>Dacryodes rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Dacryodes rubiginosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal sediments and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Dacryodes rubiginosa plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
