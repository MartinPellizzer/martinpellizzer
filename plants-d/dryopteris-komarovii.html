                    <h1>Dryopteris komarovii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
