                    <h1>Dracophyllum × vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum × vulcanicum, commonly known as the hybrid dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the local flora in volcanic landscapes.</p>
