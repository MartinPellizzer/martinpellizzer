<p>Dicranopteris pedalis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and rice fields. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris pedalis plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
