                    <h1>Dianella nemorosa f. caeruloides</h1>
<p>Dianella nemorosa f. caeruloides, commonly known as the blue-leaf flax lily, is a variant of the native New Zealand flax lily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. This ornamental plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense clump, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
