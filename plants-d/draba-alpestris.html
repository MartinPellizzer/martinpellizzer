<p>Draba alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and a compact, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Draba alpestris produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
