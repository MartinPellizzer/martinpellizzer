                    <h1>Ditassa ferricola</h1>
<p>Ditassa ferricola, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and tool-making. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are small and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Ditassa ferricola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
