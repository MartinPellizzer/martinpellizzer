                    <h1>Datura versicolor</h1>
<p>Datura versicolor, commonly known as the multiflora nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. Datura versicolor thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
