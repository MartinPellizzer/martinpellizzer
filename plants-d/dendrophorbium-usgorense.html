                    <h1>Dendrophorbium usgorense</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium usgorense, commonly known as the Uskorensky tree parasite, is a rare and specialized parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host tree for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host over time. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with a slender, vine-like structure and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for efficient nutrient absorption. It produces inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecological niche, Dendrophorbium usgorense is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
