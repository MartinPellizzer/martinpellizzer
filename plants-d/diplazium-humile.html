                    <h1>Diplazium humile</h1>
<p>Diplazium humile, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Diplazium humile is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
