                    <h1>Dodecatheon austrofrigidum</h1>
<p>Dodecatheon austrofrigidum, commonly known as the southern starflower, is a rare and cold-adapted plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
