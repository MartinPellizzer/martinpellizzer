<p>Dryopteris nushanensis, commonly known as the Nushan wood fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
