                    <h1>Drakaea isolata</h1>
<p>Drakaea isolata, commonly known as the isolated spider orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with a single, erect stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a spider. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in sandy soils within specific, often isolated habitats. Drakaea isolata is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on the mimicry of female wasps to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
