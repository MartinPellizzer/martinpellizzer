                    <h1>Dryopteris subconnexa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subconnexa, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long and have a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
