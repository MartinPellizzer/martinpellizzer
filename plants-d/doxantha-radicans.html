                    <h1>Doxantha radicans</h1>
<p>Doxantha radicans, commonly known as the wandering begonia, is a trailing evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its trailing habit, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
