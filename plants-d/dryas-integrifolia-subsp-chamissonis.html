<p>Dryas integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>chamissonis, commonly known as Chamisson's mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, hairy, and often blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
