                    <h1>Dicrastylis exsuccosa f. albolutea</h1>
<p>Dicrastylis exsuccosa f. albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered swamp lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, swampy habitats, often in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic flora. Its foliage is usually compact, forming dense clumps that help it thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
