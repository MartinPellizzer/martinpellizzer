                    <h1>Diceratostele</h1>
<p>Diceratostele, commonly known as the "double-horned stem," is a unique botanical structure found in certain vascular plants.</p>
<p>It refers to a specialized type of stem anatomy characterized by two distinct, horn-like projections. This feature is typically associated with specific genera within the fern family, particularly in certain species of Cyatheaceae. The diceratostele provides structural support and facilitates the transport of water and nutrients through its vascular bundles.</p>
<p>Its presence is a key identifier in the classification and study of certain primitive plant groups.</p>
