<p>Dryas integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>crenulata, commonly known as the alpine drumstick, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and its distinctive, rounded, white or pinkish flower heads that resemble drumsticks.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad, lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies thrives in alpine and subarctic habitats, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivorous animals.</p>
