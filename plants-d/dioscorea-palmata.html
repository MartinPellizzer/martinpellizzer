                    <h1>Dioscorea palmata</h1>
<p>Dioscorea palmata, commonly known as the palmate yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as economically important as those of other yam species.</p>
<p>Dioscorea palmata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets.</p>
