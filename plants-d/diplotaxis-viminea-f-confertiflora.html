<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, slender seed pods. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
