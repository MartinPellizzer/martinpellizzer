                    <h1>Desmostachys tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Desmostachys tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desmostachys, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous base, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
