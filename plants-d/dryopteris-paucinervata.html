                    <h1>Dryopteris paucinervata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paucinervata, commonly known as the few-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a sparse network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct groups.</p>
