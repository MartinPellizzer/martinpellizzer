<p>Dupatya leucoblephara, commonly known as the white-eyed spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and a distinctive white eye marking on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected under Philippine conservation laws.</p>
