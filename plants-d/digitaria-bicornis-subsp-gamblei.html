<p>Digitaria bicornis subsp.</p>
<p>gamblei, commonly known as Gambler's fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and often invasive species in disturbed environments.</p>
