<p>Dryopteris squamosissima, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds that are often bronze or brown in color, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
