<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
