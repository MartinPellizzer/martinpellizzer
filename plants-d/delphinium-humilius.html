<p>Delphinium humilius, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as all parts of the plant are toxic.</p>
