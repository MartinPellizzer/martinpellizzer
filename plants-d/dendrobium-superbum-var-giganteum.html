                    <h1>Dendrobium superbum var. giganteum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium superbum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, supporting clusters of large, showy flowers. Its blooms, which are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive red lip, are highly prized in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
