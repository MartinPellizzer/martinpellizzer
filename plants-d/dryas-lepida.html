                    <h1>Dryas lepida</h1>
<p>Dryas lepida, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Dryas lepida is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
