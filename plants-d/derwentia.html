                    <h1>Derwentia</h1>
<p>Derwentia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests of New Zealand. Derwentia has a unique ability to regenerate from its rhizomes, allowing it to persist through environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ancient lineage make it a valuable indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
