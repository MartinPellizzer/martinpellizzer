                    <h1>Decalophium darwinioides</h1>
<p>Decalophium darwinioides, commonly known as the Darwin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria while performing photosynthesis with its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Decalophium darwinioides is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
