                    <h1>Dactylorhiza × vogtiana</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza × vogtiana, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with numerous showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the peat-rich environment, and it is often found in association with other bog flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
