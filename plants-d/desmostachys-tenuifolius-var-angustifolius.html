                    <h1>Desmostachys tenuifolius var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Desmostachys tenuifolius var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
