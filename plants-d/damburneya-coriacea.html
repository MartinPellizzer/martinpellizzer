                    <h1>Damburneya coriacea</h1>
<p>Damburneya coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved damburneya, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the plant's seeds.</p>
<p>Damburneya coriacea is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
