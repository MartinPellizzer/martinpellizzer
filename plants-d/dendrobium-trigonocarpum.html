<p>Dendrobium trigonocarpum, commonly known as the triangle-fruit orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that often branch out horizontally. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique triangular seed pods are a distinguishing characteristic in its reproductive cycle.</p>
