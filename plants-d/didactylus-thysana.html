                    <h1>Didactylus thysana</h1>
<p>Didactylus thysana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Didactylus thysana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
