<p>Dalbergia foenumgraecum, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
