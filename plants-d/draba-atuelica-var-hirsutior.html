                    <h1>Draba atuelica var. hirsutior</h1>
<p>Draba atuelica var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
