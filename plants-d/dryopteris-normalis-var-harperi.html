                    <h1>Dryopteris normalis var. harperi</h1>
<p>Dryopteris normalis var. harperi, commonly known as the Harp's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
