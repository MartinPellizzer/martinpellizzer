<p>Dryopteris undulata, commonly known as the wavy fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that have a distinctive undulating pattern along their margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling throughout the growing season.</p>
