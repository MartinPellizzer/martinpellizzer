                    <h1>Dryopteris paucipinnata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paucipinnata, commonly known as the few-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are creeping and often produce new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
