<p>Daviesia ulicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>aridicola, commonly known as the aridland hakea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers during the autumn season, which are attractive to nectar-feeding insects. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of local biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
