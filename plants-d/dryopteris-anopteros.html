                    <h1>Dryopteris anopteros</h1>
<p>Dryopteris anopteros, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive, linear shape and a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in rocky or soil-rich substrates.</p>
<p>The barren sword fern is notable for its lack of fertile fronds, as it relies on spore reproduction for propagation.</p>
