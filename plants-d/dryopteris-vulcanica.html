                    <h1>Dryopteris vulcanica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or volcanic areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
