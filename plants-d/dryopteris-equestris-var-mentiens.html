                    <h1>Dryopteris equestris var. mentiens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris equestris var. mentiens, commonly known as the Mentz's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its stout, upright rhizomes and compound fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
