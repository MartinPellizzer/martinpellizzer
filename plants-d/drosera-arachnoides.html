The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often small and clustered, with a dense covering of red or orange secretory glands.</p>
<p>Drosera arachnoides is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats.</p>
