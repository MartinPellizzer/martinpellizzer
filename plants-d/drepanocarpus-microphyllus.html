                    <h1>Drepanocarpus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Drepanocarpus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
