<p>Dryopteris crespiana, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The cinnamon fern plays an important role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
