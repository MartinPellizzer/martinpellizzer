                    <h1>Desmodium scutatum</h1>
<p>Desmodium scutatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Desmodium scutatum is often used in forage systems due to its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
