<p>Diplomorpha capitellata, commonly known as the small-headed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, submerged leaves that often form bladders to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself with its root system. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations.</p>
