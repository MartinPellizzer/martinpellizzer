                    <h1>Dactylorhiza majalis f. barlae</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza majalis f. barlae, commonly known as the Barlae orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, low-growing habit, featuring a single, fleshy rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single or few tall, slender flowering stems bearing small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and bogs, often in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
