<p>Dennstaedtia punctilobula f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate woodsorrel, is a fern characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often described as delicate and ornamental, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'cristata' is distinguished by its curled, wave-like leaf margins, which contribute to its ornamental value.</p>
