<p>Digitaria ciliaris subsp.</p>
<p>nubica, commonly known as Nubian fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common component of dryland vegetation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its potential in forage and soil stabilization in marginal ecosystems.</p>
