                    <h1>Dracophilus montis-draconis</h1>
<p>Dracophilus montis-draconis, commonly known as the Dragon's Mount Beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and velvety leaves, which are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
