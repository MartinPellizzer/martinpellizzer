                    <h1>Dipteracanthus riparius</h1>
<p>Dipteracanthus riparius, commonly known as the river thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spiky inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in riparian zones, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and floodplains.</p>
