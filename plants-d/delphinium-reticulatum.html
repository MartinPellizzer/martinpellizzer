                    <h1>Delphinium reticulatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Delphinium reticulatum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
