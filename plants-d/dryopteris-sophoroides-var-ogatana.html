                    <h1>Dryopteris sophoroides var. ogatana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sophoroides var. ogatana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
