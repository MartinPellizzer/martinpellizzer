                    <h1>Digitaria cowiei</h1>
<p>Digitaria cowiei, commonly known as the coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments and coastal plains. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Digitaria cowiei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
