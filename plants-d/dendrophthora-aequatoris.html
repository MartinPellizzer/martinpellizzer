                    <h1>Dendrophthora aequatoris</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora aequatoris, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the neotropical region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its aerial roots penetrate the bark of the host tree to establish a connection for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora aequatoris plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting avian biodiversity.</p>
