                    <h1>Disterigma penaeoides</h1>
<p>Disterigma penaeoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, typically in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often lobed. It contains a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a feature common in many species of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Disterigma penaeoides is often used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties.</p>
