                    <h1>Dryopteris evoluta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris evoluta, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that gives the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to naturalize in woodland gardens.</p>
