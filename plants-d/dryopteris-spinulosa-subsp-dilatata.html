<p>Dryopteris spinulosa subsp.</p>
<p>dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with spiny structures along the pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
