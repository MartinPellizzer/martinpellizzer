                    <h1>Dactylorhiza saccifera var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza saccifera var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. The plant has a distinctive, elongated pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile environments. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
