                    <h1>Daemonorops erinacea</h1>
<p>Daemonorops erinacea, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and covered in a fibrous sheath. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
