<p>Draba magellanica f. microcarpa, commonly known as the Magellan dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations.</p>
