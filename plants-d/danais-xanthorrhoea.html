                    <h1>Danais xanthorrhoea</h1>
<p>Danais xanthorrhoea, commonly known as the grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, leathery leaves that form a dense rosette around a central stem. The plant produces a tall, flowering spike that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, yellowish flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>The grass tree is also known for its ability to survive bushfires, as its underground rhizomes allow it to regenerate after burning.</p>
