                    <h1>Dodsonia</h1>
<p>Dodsonia, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Dodsonia species are characterized by their slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Due to their delicate nature, they are often used in horticulture as ornamental plants in shaded gardens.</p>
