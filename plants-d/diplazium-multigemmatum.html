<p>Diplazium multigemmatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori. Diplazium multigemmatum is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and morphological features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
