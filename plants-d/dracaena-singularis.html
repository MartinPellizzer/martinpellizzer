                    <h1>Dracaena singularis</h1>
<p>Dracaena singularis, commonly known as the singular dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, often with a distinctive yellow or white margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena singularis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
