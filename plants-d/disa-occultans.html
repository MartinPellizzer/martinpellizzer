                    <h1>Disa occultans</h1>
<p>Disa occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the moist, shaded forests of southern Africa, particularly in regions like KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees rather than in soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threatened status, Disa occultans is considered a conservation priority.</p>
