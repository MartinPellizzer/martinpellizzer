                    <h1>Dalea trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Dalea trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native range.</p>
