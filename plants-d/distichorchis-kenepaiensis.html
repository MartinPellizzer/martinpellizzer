The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
