<p>Drosera hartmeyerorum, commonly known as the Hartmeyer's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy, nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a viscous liquid to immobilize insects.</p>
<p>Drosera hartmeyerorum is a low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded conditions, often found in swampy areas.</p>
