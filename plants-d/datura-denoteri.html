<p>Datura denoteri, commonly known as the desert datura, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that produces large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. The plant has thick, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Datura denoteri contains toxic alkaloids and is considered a poisonous plant, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
