<p>Discopleura major, commonly known as the giant swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Discopleura major plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
