                    <h1>Dryopteris limaensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris limaensis, commonly known as the Lima Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The fern's robust growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
