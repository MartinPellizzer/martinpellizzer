<p>Dendrobium cuculliferum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cuculliferum thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
