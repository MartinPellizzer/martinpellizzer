                    <h1>Dalbergia martini</h1>
<p>Dalbergia martini, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
