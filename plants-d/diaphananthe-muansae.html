                    <h1>Diaphananthe muansae</h1>
<p>Diaphananthe muansae, commonly known as the Muansae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
