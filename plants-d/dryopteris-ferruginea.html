                    <h1>Dryopteris ferruginea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically bronze to brown in color, with a distinctive rusty hue on the underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
