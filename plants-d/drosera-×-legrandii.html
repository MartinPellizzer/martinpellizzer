                    <h1>Drosera × legrandii</h1>
<p>Drosera × legrandii, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera peltata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap insects. This hybrid typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
