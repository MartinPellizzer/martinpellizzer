                    <h1>Dryopteris blanchetiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanquet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
