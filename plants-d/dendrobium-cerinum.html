<p>Dendrobium cerinum, commonly known as the silver-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cerinum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
