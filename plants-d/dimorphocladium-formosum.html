                    <h1>Dimorphocladium formosum</h1>
<p>Dimorphocladium formosum, commonly known as the Formosan dimorphocladium, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-form structure, with a short, stout stem and a cluster of spirally arranged leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dimorphocladium formosum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
