                    <h1>Danthonia alpina</h1>
<p>Danthonia alpina, commonly known as alpine danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Danthonia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain.</p>
