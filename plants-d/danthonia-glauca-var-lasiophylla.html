<p>Danthonia glauca var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf danthonia, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of short, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
