                    <h1>Dryopteris carthusiana var. carthusiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris carthusiana var. carthusiana, commonly known as the Carthusian shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit and a dense, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
