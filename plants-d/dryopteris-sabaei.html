<p>Dryopteris sabaei, commonly known as the Saba fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The Saba fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
