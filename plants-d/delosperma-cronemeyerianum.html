The plant produces vibrant clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it an effective ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
