<p>Dryopteris pycnopteroides, commonly known as the dense-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that give it a distinctive, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
