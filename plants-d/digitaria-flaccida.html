                    <h1>Digitaria flaccida</h1>
<p>Digitaria flaccida, commonly known as flatseed grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Digitaria flaccida is both a common weed in agricultural areas and an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
