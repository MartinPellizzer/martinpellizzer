                    <h1>Dasiogyna</h1>
<p>Dasiogyna, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate, strap-like leaf and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
