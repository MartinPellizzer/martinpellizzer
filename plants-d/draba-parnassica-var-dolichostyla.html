<p>Draba parnassica var. dolichostyla, commonly known as the long-styled alpine bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant is notable for its elongated, slender floral pedicels, which give it its specific epithet "dolichostyla.". It thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
