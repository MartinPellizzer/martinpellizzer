<p>Desmazeria unioloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the sediment, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Desmazeria unioloides plays a role in water filtration and is an indicator species for water quality.</p>
