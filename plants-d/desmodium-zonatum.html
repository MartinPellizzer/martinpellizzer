                    <h1>Desmodium zonatum</h1>
<p>Desmodium zonatum, commonly known as creeping desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Desmodium zonatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
