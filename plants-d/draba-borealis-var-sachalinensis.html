                    <h1>Draba borealis var. sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Draba borealis var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers during the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>
