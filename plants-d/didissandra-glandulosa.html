                    <h1>Didissandra glandulosa</h1>
<p>Didissandra glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular didissandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, glandular leaves that are often covered in small, sticky bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Didissandra glandulosa is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments within the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
