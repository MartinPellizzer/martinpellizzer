                    <h1>Dryopteris stierii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris stierii, commonly known as the Stier's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and subterranean, allowing it to spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
