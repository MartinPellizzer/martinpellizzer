                    <h1>Dryopteris floridana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris floridana, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps and wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
