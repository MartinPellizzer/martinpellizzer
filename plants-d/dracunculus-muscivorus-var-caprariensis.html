                    <h1>Dracunculus muscivorus var. caprariensis</h1>
<p>Dracunculus muscivorus var. caprariensis, commonly known as the European hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive purple-tinged stem. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a flat-topped umbel, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
