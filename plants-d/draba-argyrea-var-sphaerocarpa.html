                    <h1>Draba argyrea var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba argyrea var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is typically fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its spherical, rounded fruiting bodies, which contribute to its specific taxonomic classification.</p>
