<p>Dryopteris aemula, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rounded clump, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
