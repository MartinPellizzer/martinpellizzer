                    <h1>Dendrobium rantii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium rantii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, blooming in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium rantii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
