                    <h1>Donzellia</h1>
<p>Donzellia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their woody stems and often showy flowers. Donzellia species are native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where they thrive in rocky or arid environments. Their flowers are usually pink, red, or purple, and they bloom in spring or summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
