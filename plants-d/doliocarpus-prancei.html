                    <h1>Doliocarpus prancei</h1>
<p>Doliocarpus prancei, commonly known as the Prance's doliocarpus, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that enclose its seeds, a feature typical of the Doliocarpus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
