<p>Dryopteris varia var. setosa, commonly known as the silky wood fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, silky coating of fine hairs, which distinguishes it from other fern species.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant structure that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
