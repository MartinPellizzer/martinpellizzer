                    <h1>Dipterostele</h1>
<p>Dipterostele, commonly known as the "two-stemmed" plant, is a unique type of vascular plant structure found in certain ferns and their relatives.</p>
<p>It consists of two distinct vascular systems: an outer phloem and an inner xylem, which are separated by a layer of parenchyma cells. This arrangement allows for efficient transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. The dipterostele is a key feature in the evolution of more complex vascular systems in plants.</p>
<p>It is most commonly observed in the order Cyatheales, which includes tree ferns.</p>
