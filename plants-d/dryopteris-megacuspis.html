<p>Dryopteris megacuspis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
