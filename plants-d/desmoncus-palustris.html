                    <h1>Desmoncus palustris</h1>
<p>Desmoncus palustris, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, waxy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Desmoncus palustris plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
