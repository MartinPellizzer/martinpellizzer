<p>Dryopteris bedieri, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
