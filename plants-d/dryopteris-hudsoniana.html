<p>Dryopteris hudsoniana, commonly known as Hudson's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a continuous line along the veins.</p>
