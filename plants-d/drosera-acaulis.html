<p>Drosera acaulis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming species that grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairless leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs used to trap insects. These leaves also have a reddish hue, which helps attract prey.</p>
<p>Drosera acaulis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured insects.</p>
