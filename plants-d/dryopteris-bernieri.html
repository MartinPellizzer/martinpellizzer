                    <h1>Dryopteris bernieri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bernieri, commonly known as the Bernier's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
