<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, supporting the growth of its pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
