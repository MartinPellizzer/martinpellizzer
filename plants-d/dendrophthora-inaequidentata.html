                    <h1>Dendrophthora inaequidentata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora inaequidentata, commonly known as the unequal-toothed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora inaequidentata plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird species.</p>
