<p>Derwentia derwentiana subsp.</p>
<p>homalodonta, commonly known as the Derwent water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Derwent River in Tasmania. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the riverbed while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
