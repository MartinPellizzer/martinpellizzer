                    <h1>Dryopteris lanigera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lanigera, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
