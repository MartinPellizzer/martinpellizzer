<p>Dryopteris mesocarpa, commonly known as the medium-spleen fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, deeply divided fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and serrated leaflets. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern life cycle.</p>
