                    <h1>Danaida</h1>
<p>Danaida, commonly known as the milkweed butterflies, is a genus of butterflies in the family Nymphalidae.</p>
<p>These butterflies are characterized by their striking wing patterns, often featuring bold black and orange markings. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions across the Americas. The larvae of Danaida species feed on milkweed plants, which contain toxic compounds that the caterpillars sequester for defense.</p>
<p>This relationship with milkweed is crucial for both the survival of the butterflies and the ecological balance of their habitats.</p>
