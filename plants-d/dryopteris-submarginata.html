                    <h1>Dryopteris submarginata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris submarginata, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
