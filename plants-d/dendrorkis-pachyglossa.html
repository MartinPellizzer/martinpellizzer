<p>Dendrorkis pachyglossa, commonly known as the broad-lipped tree fern, is a unique member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its extensive canopy.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive broad, tongue-shaped lips on its spore-bearing cones make it easily identifiable.</p>
