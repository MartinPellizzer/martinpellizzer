                    <h1>Delphinium trigynum</h1>
<p>Delphinium trigynum, commonly known as the three-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are alternate along the stem, and its flowers typically have three sepals and three petals, giving it the "trigynum" name, meaning three-styled. Delphinium trigynum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental beauty but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content.</p>
