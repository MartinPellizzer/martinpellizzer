                            <h1>Dortmanna Linearis</h1>
<p>Dortmanna linearis is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is known for its slender, linear leaves and small, pale flowers. This plant is often found in rocky crevices and is adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
