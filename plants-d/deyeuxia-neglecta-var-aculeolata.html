                    <h1>Deyeuxia neglecta var. aculeolata</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia neglecta var. aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are often covered with fine, hair-like structures that give it a rough texture.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more pronounced, sharp-tipped leaves and a more robust growth habit.</p>
