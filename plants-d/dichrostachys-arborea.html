<p>It features compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in savanna habitats. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range.</p>
