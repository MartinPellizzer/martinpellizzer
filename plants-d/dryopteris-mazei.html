                    <h1>Dryopteris mazei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris mazei, commonly known as the Maze fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions.</p>
