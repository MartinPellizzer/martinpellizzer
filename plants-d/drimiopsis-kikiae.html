<p>Drimiopsis kikiae, commonly known as the Kikai drimiopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the winter months.</p>
<p>Drimiopsis kikiae is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
