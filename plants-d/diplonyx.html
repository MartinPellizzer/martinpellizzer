                    <h1>Diplonyx</h1>
<p>Diplonyx, commonly known as the starry nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, where they thrive in a variety of habitats. The plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. Diplonyx species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
