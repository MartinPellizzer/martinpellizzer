                    <h1>Dryopteris hangchowensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hangchowensis, commonly known as the Hangchow fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
