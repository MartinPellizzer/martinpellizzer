                    <h1>Drapetes</h1>
<p>Drapetes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale pink flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a single, slender stem that supports its showy blooms. Drapetes is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
