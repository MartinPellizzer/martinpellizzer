<p>Draba fladnizensis var. heterotricha, commonly known as the Fladnizen's rockcress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
