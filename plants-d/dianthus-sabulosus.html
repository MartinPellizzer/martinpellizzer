                    <h1>Dianthus sabulosus</h1>
<p>Dianthus sabulosus, commonly known as the sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Dianthus sabulosus is a low-growing perennial that is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
