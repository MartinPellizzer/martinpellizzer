                    <h1>Dactyladenia globosa</h1>
<p>Dactyladenia globosa, commonly known as the globular milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that provides some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Dactyladenia globosa is also notable for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
