<p>Diatoma brachiata, commonly known as the curved diatom, is a unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, or frustule, which exhibits a distinctive curved shape. The frustule is composed of two symmetrical valves, each adorned with fine, radiating patterns. Diatoma brachiata is typically found in freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds, where it plays a vital role in the aquatic food web.</p>
<p>Its ability to form resting stages allows it to survive adverse environmental conditions.</p>
