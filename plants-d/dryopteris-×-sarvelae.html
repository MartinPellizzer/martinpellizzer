                    <h1>Dryopteris × sarvelae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × sarvelae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically bi-colored, with the upper surface being dark green and the lower surface a lighter green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across its native range in Europe. It produces no spores due to its sterility, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can remain on the plant for several years, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
