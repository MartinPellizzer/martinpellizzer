                    <h1>Dryopteris glabra var. nuda</h1>
<p>Dryopteris glabra var. nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched fronds that lack the hairy texture typical of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
