                    <h1>Dyckia scrutor</h1>
<p>Dyckia scrutor, commonly known as the red-tailed dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and its striking red-pink bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dyckia scrutor is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens and collections.</p>
