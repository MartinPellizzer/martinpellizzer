                    <h1>Dortmanna thermalis</h1>
<p>Dortmanna thermalis, commonly known as the thermal Dortmanna, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to extreme thermal environments.</p>
<p>It is typically found in geothermal areas where temperatures are significantly higher than surrounding regions. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, including thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its root system is highly developed to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dortmanna thermalis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
