<p>Dendrobenthamia melanotricha, commonly known as the black-haired dendrobium, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
