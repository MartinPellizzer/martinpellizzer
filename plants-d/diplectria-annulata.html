<p>Diplectria annulata, commonly known as the ringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are whorled and often have a distinctive ringed appearance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Diplectria annulata is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.</p>
