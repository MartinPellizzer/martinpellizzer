<p>Dendrobium dactylodes, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium dactylodes is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
