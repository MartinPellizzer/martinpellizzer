                    <h1>Dalbergia acaciifolia</h1>
<p>Dalbergia acaciifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense, dark wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
