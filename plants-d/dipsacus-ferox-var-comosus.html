<p>Dipsacus ferox var. comosus, commonly known as the bristly teasel, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, burs-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges.</p>
