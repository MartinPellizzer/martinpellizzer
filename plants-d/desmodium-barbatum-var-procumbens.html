                    <h1>Desmodium barbatum var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Desmodium barbatum var. procumbens, commonly known as hairy cowpea, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is characterized by its procumbent growth habit, spreading along the ground with slender stems. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>This species is often used in forage systems and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
