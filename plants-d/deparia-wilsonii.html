                    <h1>Deparia wilsonii</h1>
<p>Deparia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
