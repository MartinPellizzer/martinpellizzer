                    <h1>Digitaria debilis</h1>
<p>Digitaria debilis, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along waterways. It is a perennial species that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Digitaria debilis is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
