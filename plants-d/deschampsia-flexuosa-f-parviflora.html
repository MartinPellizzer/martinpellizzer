                    <h1>Deschampsia flexuosa f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Deschampsia flexuosa f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. It is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
