                    <h1>Danthonidium gammiei</h1>
<p>Danthonidium gammiei, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a member of the Poaceae family and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to form dense, turfy mats, which help in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Danthonidium gammiei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
