                    <h1>Dorstenia walleri var. minor</h1>
<p>Dorstenia walleri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf star vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is smaller than the typical Dorstenia walleri, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
