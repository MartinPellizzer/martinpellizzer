                    <h1>Delphinium rugulosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium rugulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of spurred blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, rough hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
