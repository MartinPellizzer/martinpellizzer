                    <h1>Descantaria encolea</h1>
<p>Descantaria encolea, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a bright golden hue on the underside, which distinguishes it from other fern species. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
