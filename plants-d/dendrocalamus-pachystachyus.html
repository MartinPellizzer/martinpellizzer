<p>Dendrocalamus pachystachyus, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of over 30 meters. The plant has a sympodial growth pattern, with new shoots emerging from the base of the plant. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments.</p>
<p>This species is highly valued for its strong, lightweight bamboo, which is used in construction, crafts, and as a source of fiber.</p>
