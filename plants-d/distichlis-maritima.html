                    <h1>Distichlis maritima</h1>
<p>Distichlis maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, such as salt marshes and dunes, due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Distichlis maritima plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
