                    <h1>Davallia intramarginalis</h1>
<p>Davallia intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
