<p>Diplazium grammitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“60 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium grammitis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
