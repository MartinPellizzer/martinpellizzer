                    <h1>Deparia orientalis</h1>
<p>Deparia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle.</p>
