                    <h1>Drosera menziesii var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Drosera menziesii var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are usually yellowish-green, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
