<p>Dryopteris hezhangensis, commonly known as the Hezhang water fern, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
