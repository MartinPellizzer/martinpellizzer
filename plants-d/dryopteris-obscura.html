                    <h1>Dryopteris obscura</h1>
<p>Dryopteris obscura, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This fern is relatively hardy and can tolerate a range of soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
