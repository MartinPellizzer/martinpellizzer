                    <h1>Dendrophthoe medinensis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe medinensis, commonly known as the Medinensis ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized roots that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, ephemeral flowers that appear only during specific times of the year. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity.</p>
