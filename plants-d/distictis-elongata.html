                    <h1>Distictis elongata</h1>
<p>Distictis elongata, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to certain regions of Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
