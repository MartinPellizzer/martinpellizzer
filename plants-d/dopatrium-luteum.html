                    <h1>Dopatrium luteum</h1>
<p>Dopatrium luteum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in agricultural areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
