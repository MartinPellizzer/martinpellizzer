<p>Descantaria schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
