<p>Dupontia fisheri, commonly known as the Fishers' dupontia, is a rare grass species native to the coastal dunes of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Dupontia fisheri is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
