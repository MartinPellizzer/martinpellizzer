                    <h1>Dorstenia barnimiana var. angustior</h1>
<p>Dorstenia barnimiana var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf basket plant, is a member of the family Moraceae and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often spiraled leaves that form a basket-like structure, which is a unique adaptation for capturing moisture and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with slender, woody stems and a preference for tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and the plant is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture.</p>
