                    <h1>Drimys polyneura</h1>
<p>Drimys polyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, which are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers give way to dark blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans.</p>
<p>Drimys polyneura is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
