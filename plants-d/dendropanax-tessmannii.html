<p>Dendropanax tessmannii, commonly known as the Tasmanian devil plant, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
