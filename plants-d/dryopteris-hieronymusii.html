                    <h1>Dryopteris hieronymusii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hieronymusii, commonly known as the Hieronymus' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
