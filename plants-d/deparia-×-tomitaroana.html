                    <h1>Deparia × tomitaroana</h1>
<p>Deparia × tomitaroana, commonly known as the hybrid forest fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Deparia cymbifera and Deparia tomita.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
