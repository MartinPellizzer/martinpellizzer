                            <h1>Draco Cinnabari</h1>
<p>Dragon's blood tree, scientifically known as Draco cinnabari, is a unique and ancient species native to the Socotra archipelago. This tree is recognized for its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and red sap, which has been historically valued for its medicinal and spiritual properties. Its striking appearance and ecological significance make it a symbol of the island's biodiversity. The tree's resilience in harsh desert conditions highlights its adaptation to extreme environments. Despite its rarity, conservation efforts are crucial to protect this remarkable plant from extinction.</p>
