<p>Droogmansia tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's droogmansia, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiral-like arrangement of leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
