<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>dasypetala, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
