                    <h1>Dactylorchis majalis var. brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis majalis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale green to brownish-green leaves that are shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
