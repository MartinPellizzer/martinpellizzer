                    <h1>Downingia ornatissima var. eximia</h1>
<p>Downingia ornatissima var. eximia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada pincushion flower, is a delicate annual plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs.</p>
