                    <h1>Dimorphorchis celebica</h1>
<p>Dimorphorchis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes orchid, is a species native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly found in the islands of Sulawesi and the Moluccas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display a mix of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its floral structure includes a distinctive lip that plays a role in pollination, attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
