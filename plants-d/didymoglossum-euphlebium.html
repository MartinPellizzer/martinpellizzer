                    <h1>Didymoglossum euphlebium</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum euphlebium, commonly known as the small-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant forms dense mats on moist, shaded substrates such as rocks and soil in temperate regions. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum euphlebium is often found in humid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation.</p>
