<p>Diplusodon alatus, commonly known as the winged lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a leathery texture.

Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, giving it a branching, tree-like appearance.</p>
<p>Diplusodon alatus is often found on rock surfaces in temperate regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
