                    <h1>Dendrophthora confertiflora</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora confertiflora plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain insects and birds while also impacting the growth of its host trees.</p>
