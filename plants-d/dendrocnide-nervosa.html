                <h1>Dendrocnide nervosa</h1>
<p>Dendrocnide nervosa, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its highly irritant hairs, which release a painful toxin upon contact with the skin. These hairs are particularly abundant on the stems and leaves, making the plant both dangerous and distinctive.</p>
<p>Dendrocnide nervosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforests and wetlands.</p>
