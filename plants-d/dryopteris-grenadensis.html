                    <h1>Dryopteris grenadensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the island of Grenada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
