                    <h1>Dryopteris aculeata var. braunii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aculeata var. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's shield fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
