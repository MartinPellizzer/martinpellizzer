<p>Didissandra notochlaena, commonly known as the mountain sandstone plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to dry environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Didissandra notochlaena is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
