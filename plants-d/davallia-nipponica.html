<p>Davallia nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Japan and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically light green with a finely textured appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Davallia nipponica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ease of care.</p>
