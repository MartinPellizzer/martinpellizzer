<p>Declieuxia muscosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet fern, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Declieuxia muscosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
