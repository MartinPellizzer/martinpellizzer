                    <h1>Diplazium pullingeri var. daweishanicola</h1>
<p>Diplazium pullingeri var. daweishanicola, commonly known as the Daweishan spleenwort, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can absorb humidity from the air. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
