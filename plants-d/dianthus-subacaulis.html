                    <h1>Dianthus subacaulis</h1>
<p>Dianthus subacaulis, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Dianthus subacaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
