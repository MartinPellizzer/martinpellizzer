<p>Dryopteris pallida subsp.</p>
<p>raddeana, commonly known as the pink fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Asia and North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with a pale pink or reddish hue, especially when young.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
