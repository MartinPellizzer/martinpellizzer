                    <h1>Danthonia scabra var. glomerata</h1>
<p>Danthonia scabra var. glomerata, commonly known as the hairy muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
