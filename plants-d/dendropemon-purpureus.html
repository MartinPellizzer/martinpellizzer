                    <h1>Dendropemon purpureus</h1>
<p>Dendropemon purpureus, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for its unique floral display.</p>
