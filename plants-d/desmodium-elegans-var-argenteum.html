                    <h1>Desmodium elegans var. argenteum</h1>
<p>Desmodium elegans var. argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are clustered in racemes. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface.</p>
<p>This species is often grown as a forage plant due to its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
