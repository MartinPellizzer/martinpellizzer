<p>Desmazeria marina subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflora, commonly known as the coastal dwarf seagrass, is a rare and specialized marine plant found in shallow, sandy coastal waters. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and reduced foliage, which are adaptations to its harsh, saline environment.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in areas with strong wave action and low light conditions, making it a unique component of intertidal ecosystems. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are essential to protect this subspecies from habitat degradation and human disturbance.</p>
