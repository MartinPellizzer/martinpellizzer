                    <h1>Digitaria stricta</h1>
<p>Digitaria stricta, commonly known as rigid digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust and upright growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots make it resilient to drought and grazing, contributing to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Digitaria stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
