                    <h1>Dracula syndactyla</h1>
<p>Dracula syndactyla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly figures. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Dracula syndactyla is considered critically endangered.</p>
