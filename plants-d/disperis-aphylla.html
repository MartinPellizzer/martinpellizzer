                <h1>Disperis aphylla</h1>
<p>Disperis aphylla, commonly known as the naked-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often reduced or absent, giving it its common name. Native to the high altitudes of eastern Africa, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Disperis aphylla is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
