                    <h1>Dioon imbricatum</h1>
<p>Dioon imbricatum, commonly known as the Mexican hat plant, is a cycad species native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are bright green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
