                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata f. triramea</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata f. triramea, commonly known as the three-branched sheep's fescue, is a botanical variant of the common sheep's fescue.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure, where the spikelets are arranged in three-branched clusters, distinguishing it from the typical form. This grass species is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>The variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ecological roles.</p>
