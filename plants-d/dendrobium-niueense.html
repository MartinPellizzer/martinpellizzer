                    <h1>Dendrobium niueense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium niueense, commonly known as the Niue orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the island of Niue in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with high light exposure and well-draining substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
