The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
