<p>Dendrostylis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrostylis grandifolia thrives in humid climates and is often found in dense rainforests.</p>
