<p>Diplazium brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium brasiliense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>
