                    <h1>Dennstaedtia decomposita</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia decomposita, commonly known as the fern of the forest floor, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and form a dense network that helps anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
