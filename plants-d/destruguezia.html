                    <h1>Destruguezia</h1>
<p>Destruguezia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, often resinous sap and its tropical to subtropical distribution. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Destrugezia species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in craftsmanship and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
