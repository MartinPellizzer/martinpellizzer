                    <h1>Dryopteris gongboensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gongboensis, commonly known as Gongbo fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the high-altitude regions of southern Tibet and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the genus Dryopteris.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its potential ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
