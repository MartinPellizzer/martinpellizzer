                    <h1>Dendrophthoe racemifera</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe racemifera, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemi-parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often fragrant. Its root system is specialized for penetrating the host's tissues, allowing it to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
