                    <h1>Dendrobium ochraceum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is used to attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium ochraceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
