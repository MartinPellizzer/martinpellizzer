                    <h1>Dalbergia elata</h1>
<p>Dalbergia elata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
