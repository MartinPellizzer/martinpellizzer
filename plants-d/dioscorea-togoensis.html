                    <h1>Dioscorea togoensis</h1>
<p>Dioscorea togoensis, commonly known as Togo yam, is a climbing vine native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>However, like many yam species, it contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation before consumption.</p>
