<p>Diplachne cearensis, commonly known as the Cear√° grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne cearensis is adapted to thrive in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of wetland ecosystems and plant adaptation.</p>
