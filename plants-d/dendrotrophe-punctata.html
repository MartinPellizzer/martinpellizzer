                    <h1>Dendrotrophe punctata</h1>
<p>Dendrotrophe punctata, commonly known as the spotted bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on the bark of trees in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green thallus with scattered black dots, which are the reproductive structures called soredia. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on the trunks and branches of hardwood trees, particularly oaks and maples.</p>
<p>Dendrotrophe punctata is an indicator species for clean air and healthy forest ecosystems.</p>
