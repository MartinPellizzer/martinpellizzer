                    <h1>Dendrobium unibulbe</h1>
<p>Dendrobium unibulbe, commonly known as the single-bulb orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, characterized by a single, swollen pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green.</p>
<p>Dendrobium unibulbe is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
