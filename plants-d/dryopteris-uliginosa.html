                    <h1>Dryopteris uliginosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris uliginosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping fronds that are covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
