                    <h1>Dryopteris ciliata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ciliata, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
