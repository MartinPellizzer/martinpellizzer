<p>Dicksonia ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive sori, which are clusters of sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The trunk is covered in a fibrous, rough-textured rind that protects the vascular system.</p>
