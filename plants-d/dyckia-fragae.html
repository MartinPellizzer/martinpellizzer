                    <h1>Dyckia fragae</h1>
<p>Dyckia fragae, commonly known as the fragrant dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
