                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. marginata</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. marginata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted clusters of small, spikelike flowers. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dune environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions.</p>
