                    <h1>Daphne mezereum var. alba-plena</h1>
<p>Daphne mezereum var. alba-plena, commonly known as the white-flowered mezereum, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments.</p>
