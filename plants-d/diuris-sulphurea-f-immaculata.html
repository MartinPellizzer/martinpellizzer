<p>Diuris sulphurea f. immaculata, commonly known as the sulphur-crested diuris, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green coloration, with a single, elongated flower spike bearing several pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats, often in areas with limited moisture. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of the typical red or orange markings found on the standard form of Diuris sulphurea.</p>
