                    <h1>Desmodium patens</h1>
<p>Desmodium patens, commonly known as the creeping sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Desmodium patens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it beneficial in agricultural settings.</p>
