<p>Dendrobium centrale var. contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance.</p>
