                    <h1>Durio bukitrayaensis</h1>
<p>Durio bukitrayaensis, commonly known as the Bukitraya durian, is a rare and endemic species native to the highland regions of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit that matures to a golden-yellow color. The tree typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom before the fruit develops. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth surface and a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Durio bukitrayaensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
