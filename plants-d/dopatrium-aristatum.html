<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange color and filamentous stems that wrap around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is native to North America and is often found in open areas where its host plants grow.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host species.</p>
