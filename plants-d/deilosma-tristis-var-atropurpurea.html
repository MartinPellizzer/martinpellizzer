                    <h1>Deilosma tristis var. atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Deilosma tristis var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish hue on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a common weed and an indicator of disturbed or wet habitats.</p>
