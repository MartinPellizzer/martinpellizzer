                    <h1>Diplazium celtidifolium var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Diplazium celtidifolium var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The sterile fronds are typically longer and more slender, while the fertile fronds bear spore-producing structures on their undersides.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
