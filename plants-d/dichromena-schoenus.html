                    <h1>Dichromena schoenus</h1>
<p>Dichromena schoenus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruits are buoyant, facilitating seed dispersal by water.</p>
<p>Dichromena schoenus plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
