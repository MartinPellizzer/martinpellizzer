                    <h1>Didymochlaena lunulata var. dimidiata</h1>
<p>Didymochlaena lunulata var. dimidiata, commonly known as the half-moon fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that often display a striking contrast between light and dark green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>The varietal form, dimidiata, is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, particularly the presence of a central, crescent-shaped structure.</p>
