                    <h1>Diplazium ellipticum</h1>
<p>Diplazium ellipticum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The leaves are typically elliptical in shape, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal in its natural habitat.</p>
