                    <h1>Dendrobium attenuatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize sunlight absorption in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium attenuatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
