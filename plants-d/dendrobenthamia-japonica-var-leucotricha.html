<p>Dendrobenthamia japonica var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its unique, hairy appearance on both stems and leaves.</p>
