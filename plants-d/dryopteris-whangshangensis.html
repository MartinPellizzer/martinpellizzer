                    <h1>Dryopteris whangshangensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris whangshangensis, commonly known as the Whangshang wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access adequate humidity and light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
