<p>Dryopteris cambrensis subsp.</p>
<p>insubrica, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a fern native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native ecosystems.</p>
