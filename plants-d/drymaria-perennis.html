<p>Drymaria perennis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria perennis is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
