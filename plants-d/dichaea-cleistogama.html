                    <h1>Dichaea cleistogama</h1>
<p>Dichaea cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous dichaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on cleistogamous (closed) flowering for reproduction.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to produce seeds without the need for pollinators, making it well-suited for its ecological niche.</p>
