<p>Deparia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusi water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, green mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate while supporting the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, delicate pinnae that help in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water.</p>
