                    <h1>Dryopteris buschiana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris buschiana, commonly known as the Busch's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
