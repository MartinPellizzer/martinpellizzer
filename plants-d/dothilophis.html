                    <h1>Dothilophis</h1>
<p>Dothilophis, commonly known as the African thread snake, is a small, non-venomous snake species native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Colubridae and is characterized by its slender body and elongated, thread-like appearance. The plant name "Dothilophis" is actually a misnomer, as it refers to a snake rather than a botanical species. This confusion highlights the importance of accurate nomenclature in botany.</p>
<p>The term "Dothilophis" may have been mistakenly applied to a plant in historical or taxonomic records.</p>
