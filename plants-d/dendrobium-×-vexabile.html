<p>Dendrobium × vexabile, commonly known as the orchid with the yellow and green flowers, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features long, arching stems with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, green, and white. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × vexabile is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
