<p>Dichorexia, commonly known as the "two-seed grass," is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-seed structure, which sets it apart from other grasses. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that contain two seeds each.</p>
<p>Dichorexia plays a minor role in local ecosystems, primarily as a source of forage for small herbivores.</p>
