<p>Delphinium parryi subsp.</p>
<p>purpureum, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
