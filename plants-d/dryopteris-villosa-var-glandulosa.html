                    <h1>Dryopteris villosa var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris villosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the silky wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
