                    <h1>Draba rupestris var. distigmatica</h1>
<p>Draba rupestris var. distigmatica, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and limited soil. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine flora communities.</p>
