                    <h1>Dendrobium alpinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium alpinum thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
