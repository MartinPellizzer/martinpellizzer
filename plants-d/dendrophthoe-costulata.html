                    <h1>Dendrophthoe costulata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe costulata, commonly known as the red-rooted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a slender, woody stem with small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its roots penetrate the host tree's tissues to extract water and nutrients, making it a semi-parasitic species.</p>
<p>The plant's unique life cycle and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
