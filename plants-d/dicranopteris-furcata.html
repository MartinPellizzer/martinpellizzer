<p>Dicranopteris furcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris furcata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
