                    <h1>Didymoglossum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf thyme moss, is a small, cushion-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-like structure. The plant has short, acicular leaves that are often curved and covered in a layer of fine, papillate cells. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, rock, or decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting microfauna in its ecosystem.</p>
