<p>Dryopteris wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>coriacea, commonly known as the thick-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically grouped in clusters.</p>
