<p>Dryopteris viscidula, commonly known as the sticky wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
