<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and entire, providing structural support and water retention in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a cluster of eight to ten petals. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky areas and tundra, contributing to the ecological diversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
