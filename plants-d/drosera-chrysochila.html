                    <h1>Drosera chrysochila</h1>
<p>Drosera chrysochila, commonly known as the golden mistletoe sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sticky hair-like structures that secrete a sweet mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a cluster, and its leaves are typically covered in glandular trichomes. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands.</p>
<p>Drosera chrysochila is a low-growing plant that relies on insect prey for nutrients due to the nutrient-poor soils it inhabits.</p>
