                    <h1>Dryopteris lanipes f. minor</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lanipes f. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The fronds are typically shorter and more delicate compared to the typical form of D. lanipes, with a dense, bushy appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies.</p>
