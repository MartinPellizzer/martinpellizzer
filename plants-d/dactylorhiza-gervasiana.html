<p>Dactylorhiza gervasiana, commonly known as the Gervasoni orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often pink or purple, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments.
