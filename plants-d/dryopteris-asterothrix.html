                    <h1>Dryopteris asterothrix</h1>
<p>Dryopteris asterothrix, commonly known as the starry shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The distinctive star-like arrangement of its spore clusters gives it its common name.</p>
