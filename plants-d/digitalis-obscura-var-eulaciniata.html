                    <h1>Digitalis obscura var. eulaciniata</h1>
<p>Digitalis obscura var. eulaciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is closely related to other foxglove species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>However, like all Digitalis species, it contains toxic cardiac glycosides and should be handled with care.</p>
