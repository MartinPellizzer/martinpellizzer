                            <h1>Dictyogramme Podophylla</h1>
<p>Podophyllous hart's-tongue, scientifically known as Dictyogramme podophylla, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. This unique plant is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like leaves that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or moist forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. The plant's historical and ecological significance makes it an important subject for conservation and botanical study.</p>
