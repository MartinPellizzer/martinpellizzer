                    <h1>Dendrobium faciferum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium faciferum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that often branch and produce clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Dendrobium faciferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
