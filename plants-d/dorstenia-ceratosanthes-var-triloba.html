                    <h1>Dorstenia ceratosanthes var. triloba</h1>
<p>Dorstenia ceratosanthes var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed false arum, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces a striking spathe and spadix inflorescence, typical of the arum family, with the spadix bearing small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a popular choice in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
