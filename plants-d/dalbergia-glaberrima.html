<p>Dalbergia glaberrima, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves during the dry season. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-white or pinkish hues, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agroforestry systems.</p>
