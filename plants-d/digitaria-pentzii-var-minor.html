                    <h1>Digitaria pentzii var. minor</h1>
<p>Digitaria pentzii var. minor, commonly known as dwarf fingergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Digitaria genus. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality.</p>
<p>This species is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
