                    <h1>Dendrophylax funalis</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax funalis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces striking white or pale green flowers with a distinct, hood-like structure. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
