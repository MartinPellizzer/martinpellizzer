<p>Delosperma frutescens, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
