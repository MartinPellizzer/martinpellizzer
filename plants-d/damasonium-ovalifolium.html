<p>Damasonium ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf water clover, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are oval in shape with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Damasonium ovalifolium plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
