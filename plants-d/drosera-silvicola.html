                    <h1>Drosera silvicola</h1>
<p>Drosera silvicola, commonly known as the forest sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sweet, sticky substance to lure prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in peat bogs or shaded areas.</p>
<p>Drosera silvicola is relatively small, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters.</p>
