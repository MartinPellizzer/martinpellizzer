<p>Dracula inexperata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>

The plant's flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Dracula inexperata is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of pristine, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
