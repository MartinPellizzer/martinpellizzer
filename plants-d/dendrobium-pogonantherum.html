<p>Dendrobium pogonantherum, commonly known as the woolly-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, hairy lip. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium pogonantherum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
