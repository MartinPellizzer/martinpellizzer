                    <h1>Desmanthus velutinus</h1>
<p>Desmanthus velutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
