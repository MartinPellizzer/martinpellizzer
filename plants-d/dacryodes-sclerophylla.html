                    <h1>Dacryodes sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Dacryodes sclerophylla, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood value, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
