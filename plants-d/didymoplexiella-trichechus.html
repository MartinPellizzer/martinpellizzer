<p>Didymoplexiella trichechus, commonly known as the sea cow's hair, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that resemble the fur of marine mammals. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is typically found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
