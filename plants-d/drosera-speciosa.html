                    <h1>Drosera speciosa</h1>
<p>Drosera speciosa, commonly known as the showy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
