                    <h1>Drimyspermum billardieri</h1>
<p>Drimyspermum billardieri, commonly known as the Chilean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America, particularly Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as the *Nothofagus* species. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
