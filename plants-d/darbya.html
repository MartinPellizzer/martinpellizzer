                    <h1>Darbya</h1>
<p>Darbya, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Darbya species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while their leaves float on the surface.</p>
<p>The flowers of Darbya play an important role in attracting pollinators like beetles and bees.</p>
