                    <h1>Deprea nieva</h1>
<p>Deprea nieva, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a rare and delicate species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, hairy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
