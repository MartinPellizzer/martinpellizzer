                    <h1>Douglasia ochotensis subsp. arctica</h1>
<p>Douglasia ochotensis subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as the Arctic Douglasia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic tundra regions of Siberia and Alaska. It features small, delicate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to the cold and nutrient-poor environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to harsh climatic conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience in extreme environments.</p>
