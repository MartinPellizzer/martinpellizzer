                    <h1>Disporum sessile var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Disporum sessile var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved disporum, is a rare variant of the disporum plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
