                    <h1>Dryopteris sturmii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sturmii, commonly known as the Sturm's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest understory.</p>
