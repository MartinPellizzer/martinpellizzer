<p>Dendrobium platycaule, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulbous stem structure with a flattened appearance, which helps it store water and nutrients. The plant produces linear, often dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Its flowers are typically showy, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and are borne on terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Dendrobium platycaule thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
