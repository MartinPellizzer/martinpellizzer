                    <h1>Digitalis pichleri</h1>
<p>Digitalis pichleri, commonly known as the Alpine foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Digitalis genus. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
