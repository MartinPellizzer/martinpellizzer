<p>Diplolepis vomitoria, commonly known as the vomiter's thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes used as a living fence or barrier in rural areas.</p>
