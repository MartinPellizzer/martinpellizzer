                    <h1>Dryas</h1>
<p>Dryas, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, harsh environments. Dryas species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Dryas octopetala and Dryas integrifolia, which are well-adapted to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
