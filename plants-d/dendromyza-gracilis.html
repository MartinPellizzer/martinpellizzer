                    <h1>Dendromyza gracilis</h1>
<p>Dendromyza gracilis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. The plant's root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
