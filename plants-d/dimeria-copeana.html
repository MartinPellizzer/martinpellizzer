<p>Dimeria copeana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which range in color from white to yellow, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Dimeria copeana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
