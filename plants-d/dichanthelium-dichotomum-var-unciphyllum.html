                    <h1>Dichanthelium dichotomum var. unciphyllum</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium dichotomum var. unciphyllum, commonly known as the slender dichanthelium, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed among the foliage. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring and summer months, and it is characterized by its unique branching pattern.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other members of the species by its shorter, more compact growth form and specific leaf morphology.</p>
