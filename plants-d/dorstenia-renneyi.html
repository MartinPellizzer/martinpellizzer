                    <h1>Dorstenia renneyi</h1>
<p>Dorstenia renneyi, commonly known as the "Corky Tree" or "Corky" for its unique, cork-like bark, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody, tree-like structure with thick, ridged bark that resembles cork. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. Dorstenia renneyi is often cultivated for its ornamental bark and unique appearance, though it is not commonly found in commercial horticulture.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
