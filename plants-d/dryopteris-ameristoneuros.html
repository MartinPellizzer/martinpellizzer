<p>Dryopteris ameristoneuros, commonly known as the American wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its feathery appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
