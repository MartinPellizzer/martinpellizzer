                    <h1>Daucus carota var. maximus</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. maximus, commonly known as the giant parsnip, is a variant of the wild carrot that exhibits significantly larger leaves and stems compared to the standard species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length, and its tall, hollow stems that often exceed two meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are usually less developed than those of the common carrot, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its large size and potential for rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
