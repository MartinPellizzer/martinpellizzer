                    <h1>Dendrobium grastidioides</h1>
<p>Dendrobium grastidioides, commonly known as the Grastidioides orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
