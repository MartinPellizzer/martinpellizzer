<p>Doryopteris angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, compact growth habit with a rosette of leaves forming a dense, low-growing cluster. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Doryopteris angustata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
