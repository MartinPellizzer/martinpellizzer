                    <h1>Dortmanna mollis</h1>
<p>Dortmanna mollis, commonly known as the soft dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Dortmanna mollis is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for certain insects.</p>
