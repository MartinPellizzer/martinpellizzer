                    <h1>Deuterocohnia schreiteri</h1>
<p>Deuterocohnia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, and it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deuterocohnia schreiteri is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
