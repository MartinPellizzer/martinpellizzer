                    <h1>Dedea oreophila</h1>
<p>Dedea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its unique habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dedea oreophila is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
