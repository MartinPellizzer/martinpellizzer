                    <h1>Drosera spiralis</h1>
<p>Drosera spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its leaves forming a rosette that helps retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and specialized adaptations, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
