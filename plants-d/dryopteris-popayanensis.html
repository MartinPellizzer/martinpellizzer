<p>Dryopteris popayanensis, commonly known as the Popay√°n fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a unique appearance.</p>
