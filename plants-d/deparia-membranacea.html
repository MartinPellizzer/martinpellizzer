                    <h1>Deparia membranacea</h1>
<p>Deparia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's translucent, membranous texture gives it its common name and contributes to its unique appearance in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
