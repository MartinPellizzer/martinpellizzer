<p>Desmodium brachystachyum, commonly known as small-stalk desmodium, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
