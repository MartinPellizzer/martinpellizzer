<p>Danthonia forskaolii subsp.</p>
<p>persica, commonly known as Persian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a delicate, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
