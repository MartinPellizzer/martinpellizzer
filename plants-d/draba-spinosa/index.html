                            <h1>Draba Spinosa</h1>
<p>Draba spinosa, commonly known as the prickly rockcress, is a small flowering plant that thrives in harsh environments. It is native to mountainous regions across Europe and Asia, where it adapts to cold and rocky soils. This plant is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and hairy, spiny leaves that help protect it from the elements. Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient and can survive in extreme conditions. Its presence often indicates a healthy ecosystem in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
