<p>Datura waymanii, commonly known as the Mexican devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces spiny, lobed leaves and has a branched, woody stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white in color and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators, such as moths.</p>
<p>Datura waymanii contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
