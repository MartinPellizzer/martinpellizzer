                    <h1>Draba nemorosa var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Draba nemorosa var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a basal rosette of leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its compact growth form and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils make it well adapted to harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in crevices and on scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
