                            <h1>Draba Incompta Var. Persica</h1>
<p>Persian draba, scientifically known as Draba incompta var. persica, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. This member of the Brassicaceae family is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and compact, rosette-like leaves. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Persian draba is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from threats such as climate change and habitat loss.</p>
