                    <h1>Deyeuxia hyperborea var. stenodes</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia hyperborea var. stenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
