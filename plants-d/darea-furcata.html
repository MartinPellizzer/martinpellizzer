                    <h1>Darea furcata</h1>
<p>Darea furcata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a distinctive forked or branched growth pattern, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus.</p>
<p>Darea furcata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
