                    <h1>Defforgia</h1>
<p>Defforgia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer in the dappled light of the forest understory. The plant produces striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to secrete a mild hallucinogenic substance, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Defforgia is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
