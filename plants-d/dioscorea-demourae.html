                    <h1>Dioscorea demourae</h1>
<p>Dioscorea demourae, commonly known as the African yam vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature. Its tubers are used as a food source in some cultures, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and climbing habit make it a significant component of its native ecosystems.</p>
