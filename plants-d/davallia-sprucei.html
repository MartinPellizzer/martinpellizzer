<p>Davallia sprucei, commonly known as the fern moss or spruce fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense mats, which help anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>Davallia sprucei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in the right conditions.</p>
