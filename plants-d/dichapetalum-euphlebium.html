<p>Dichapetalum euphlebium, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of orchids, though it is not a true orchid. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy flower that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dichapetalum euphlebium is considered an endangered species.</p>
