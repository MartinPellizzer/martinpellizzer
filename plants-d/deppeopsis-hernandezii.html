                    <h1>Deppeopsis hernandezii</h1>
<p>Deppeopsis hernandezii, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are consumed by birds, which then aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a dense, cushion-like formation.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological relationships and limited distribution.</p>
