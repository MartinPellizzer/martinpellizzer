                    <h1>Dracula mopsus</h1>
<p>Dracula mopsus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a skull, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Dracula mopsus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
