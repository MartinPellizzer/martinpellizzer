<p>Dryopteris sorbifolia f. genuina, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and stout, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it in rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
