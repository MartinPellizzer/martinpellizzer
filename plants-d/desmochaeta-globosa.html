                    <h1>Desmochaeta globosa</h1>
<p>Desmochaeta globosa, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are often eaten by birds. It is native to parts of South America and is typically found in humid, tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
