<p>Dyerocycas micholitzii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
