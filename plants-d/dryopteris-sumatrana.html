                    <h1>Dryopteris sumatrana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
