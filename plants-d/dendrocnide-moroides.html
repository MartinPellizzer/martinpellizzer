<p>Dendrocnide moroides, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its highly toxic sap, which contains a potent mix of chemicals that cause severe skin irritation. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, despite the risks involved.</p>
<p>The stinging tree thrives in moist, shaded environments and is a common feature of rainforests in Queensland.</p>
