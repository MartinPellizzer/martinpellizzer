<p>Dryandra erythrocephala var. inopinata, commonly known as the red-headed dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern region of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, bottle-shaped flower heads, which contrast sharply with its grey-green foliage. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
