<p>Davallia falcinella, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddle-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Davallia falcinella is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
