<p>Dipsacus dubius, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, cone-like seed heads. Dipsacus dubius is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Its unique structure has made it historically important in the production of natural fibers for textiles.</p>
