<p>Dendrobium flabelloides, commonly known as the orchid with the flabellate lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, fan-shaped lip.</p>
<p>Dendrobium flabelloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
