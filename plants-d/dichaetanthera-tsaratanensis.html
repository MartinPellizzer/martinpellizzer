<p>Dichaetanthera tsaratanensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sword fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds and unique reproductive structures. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help it colonize rocky and moist habitats. Its spores are produced in specialized clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
