<p>Deschampsia airiformis, commonly known as the cloud grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that resembles clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is often found in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows.</p>
