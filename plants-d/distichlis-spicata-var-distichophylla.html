                    <h1>Distichlis spicata var. distichophylla</h1>
<p>Distichlis spicata var. distichophylla, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common plant in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral presence to its often overlooked habitat.</p>
