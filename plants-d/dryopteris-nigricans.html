                    <h1>Dryopteris nigricans</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nigricans, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
