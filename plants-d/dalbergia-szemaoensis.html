<p>Dalbergia szemaoensis, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a species of legume in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in China, Vietnam, and Laos. The plant is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds.
