<p>Desmoncus orthacanthos, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also help reduce water loss by providing shade.</p>
<p>Overall, Desmoncus orthacanthos exemplifies the adaptive strategies of plants in extreme climates.</p>
