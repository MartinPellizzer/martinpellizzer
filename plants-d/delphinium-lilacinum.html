<p>Delphinium lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Delphinium lilacinum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its high concentration of alkaloids.</p>
