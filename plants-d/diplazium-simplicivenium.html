<p>Diplazium simplicivenium, commonly known as the simple-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple in structure, with a single midrib and branching veins that give it its common name.</p>
