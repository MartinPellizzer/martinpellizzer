<p>Dicranopteris emarginata, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris emarginata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
