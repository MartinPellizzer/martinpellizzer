<p>Dendrobium × statterianum, commonly known as the Statter's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × statterianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
