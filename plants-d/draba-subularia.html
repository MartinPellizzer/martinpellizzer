                    <h1>Draba subularia</h1>
<p>Draba subularia, commonly known as the small whitlow grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Draba subularia is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowering period is short, and it is often one of the first plants to bloom in early spring.</p>
