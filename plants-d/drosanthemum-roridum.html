<p>Drosanthemum roridum, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Drosanthemum roridum is also known for its ability to self-seed, contributing to its natural spread in its native habitat.</p>
