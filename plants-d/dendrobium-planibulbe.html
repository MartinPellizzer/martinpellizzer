<p>Dendrobium planibulbe, commonly known as the flat bulb orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or pink.</p>
<p>Dendrobium planibulbe thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
