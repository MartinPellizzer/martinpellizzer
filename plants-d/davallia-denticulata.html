<p>Davallia denticulata, commonly known as the serrated hartiya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine, tooth-like serrations along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense, mat-like colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens or indoor collections.</p>
