                    <h1>Diplochita caudata</h1>
<p>Diplochita caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed ant plant, is a unique bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a tail, hence its common name. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
