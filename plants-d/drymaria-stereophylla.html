                    <h1>Drymaria stereophylla</h1>
<p>Drymaria stereophylla, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Drymaria stereophylla is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
