                    <h1>Dendrocnide morobensis</h1>
<p>Dendrocnide morobensis, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notorious for its painful, histamine-induced skin irritation caused by its fine, venomous hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a challenging plant to handle and is sometimes referred to as the "devil's ivy.".</p>
