<p>Dicranopteris lehmannii, commonly known as the lehmann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
