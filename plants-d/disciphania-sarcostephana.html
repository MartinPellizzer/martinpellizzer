<p>Disciphania sarcostephana, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on desert flora and xerophytic adaptations.</p>
