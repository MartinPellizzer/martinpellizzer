<p>Danthonia intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>riabuschinskii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Russia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
