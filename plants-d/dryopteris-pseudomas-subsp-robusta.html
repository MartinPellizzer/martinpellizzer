<p>Dryopteris pseudomas subsp.</p>
<p>robusta, commonly known as the robust fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The subspecies robusta is distinguished by its more robust fronds and broader leaflets compared to other members of the species.</p>
