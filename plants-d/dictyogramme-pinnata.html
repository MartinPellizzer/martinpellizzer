                    <h1>Dictyogramme pinnata</h1>
<p>Dictyogramme pinnata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, intricately pinnate fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Matoniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
