                    <h1>Diplycosia muscicola</h1>
<p>Diplycosia muscicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. The plant's thallus is typically green or yellowish-green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution, it serves as an indicator of environmental health.</p>
