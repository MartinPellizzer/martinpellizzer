                    <h1>Distichorchis rupicola</h1>
<p>Distichorchis rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a unique two-lipped structure typical of orchids. It has a short flowering period, usually in the spring or early summer, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
