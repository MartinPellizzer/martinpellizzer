<p>It is typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils of heathlands and moorlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia scotica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
