                    <h1>Dendrophthoe pentandra</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe pentandra, commonly known as the Indian ghost fern, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Dendrophthoaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its specialized structures called haustoria, which connect to the host's vascular system. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique ecological role as a parasite and its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
