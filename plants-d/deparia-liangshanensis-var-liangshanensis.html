                    <h1>Deparia liangshanensis var. liangshanensis</h1>
<p>Deparia liangshanensis var. liangshanensis, commonly known as the Liangshan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
