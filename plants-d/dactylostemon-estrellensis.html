                    <h1>Dactylostemon estrellensis</h1>
<p>Dactylostemon estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan star-leaf, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a small area in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in specific microhabitats with limited sunlight. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
