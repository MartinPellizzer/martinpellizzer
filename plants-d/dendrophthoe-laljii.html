                    <h1>Dendrophthoe laljii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe laljii, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the stems of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which gives it a pale, ghostly appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions.</p>
