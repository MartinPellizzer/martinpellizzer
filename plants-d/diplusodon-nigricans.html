                    <h1>Diplusodon nigricans</h1>
<p>Diplusodon nigricans, commonly known as the black-tailed skink, is a species of lizard native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scincidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinct black tail. The plant in question is not a botanical species but a reptile, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
