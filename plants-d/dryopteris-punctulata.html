                    <h1>Dryopteris punctulata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris punctulata, commonly known as the dotterel fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded black spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
