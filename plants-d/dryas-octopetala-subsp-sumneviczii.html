<p>Dryas octopetala subsp.</p>
<p>sumneviczii, commonly known as the Alpine dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
