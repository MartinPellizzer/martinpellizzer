<p>Decandolia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping decandolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Decandolia stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
