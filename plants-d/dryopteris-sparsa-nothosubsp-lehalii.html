<p>Dryopteris sparsa nothosubsp.</p>
<p>lehalii, commonly known as the Lethal fern, is a rare and relict plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
