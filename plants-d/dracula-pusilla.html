                    <h1>Dracula pusilla</h1>
<p>Dracula pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark violet flowers that resemble the shape of a bat, earning it its dramatic common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the air, and it is known for its delicate, intricately veined leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, Dracula pusilla is considered an endangered species.</p>
