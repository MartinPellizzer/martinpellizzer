<p>Dictyogramme obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has elongated, floating fronds that are divided into smaller, spoon-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dictyogramme obtusifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
