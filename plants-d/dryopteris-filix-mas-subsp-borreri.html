<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>borreri, commonly known as the Borreri Shield Fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
