                    <h1>Dactyloctenium aegyptium f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium aegyptium f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flatweed, is a variant of the annual grass species native to warm climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the production of small, narrow leaves. One of its notable botanical features is the viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before falling to the ground. The plant typically forms dense mats, which can compete with other vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
