<p>Damasonium alisma subsp.</p>
<p>polyspermum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The subspecies polyspermum is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other varieties of the species.</p>
