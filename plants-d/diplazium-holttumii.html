<p>Diplazium holttumii, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of its spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>Diplazium holttumii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
