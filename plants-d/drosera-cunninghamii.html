<p>Drosera cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Despite its ability to capture prey, it primarily relies on photosynthesis for nutrition.</p>
