                    <h1>Danthonia nivicola</h1>
<p>Danthonia nivicola, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and alpine meadows, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in loose spikes and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Danthonia nivicola plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivores in its ecosystem.</p>
