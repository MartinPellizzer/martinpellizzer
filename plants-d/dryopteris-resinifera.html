                    <h1>Dryopteris resinifera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris resinifera, commonly known as the resinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
