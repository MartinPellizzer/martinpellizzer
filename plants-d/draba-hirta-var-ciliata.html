                    <h1>Draba hirta var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Draba hirta var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features basal rosettes of hairy, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to harsh conditions with its compact growth form. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Draba hirta var. ciliata is often found in crevices and on slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
