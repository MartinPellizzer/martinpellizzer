                    <h1>Danthonia scabriflora</h1>
<p>Danthonia scabriflora, commonly known as roughleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and sandy soils of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on the upper surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to wetland environments and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Danthonia scabriflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
