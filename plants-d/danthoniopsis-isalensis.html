<p>Danthoniopsis isalensis, commonly known as the Isla grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Isla de la Juventud in Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danthoniopsis isalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
