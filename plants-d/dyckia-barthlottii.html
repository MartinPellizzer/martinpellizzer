<p>Dyckia barthlottii, commonly known as the Barthlott's dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.

Dyckia barthlottii is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance contribute to its appeal among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
