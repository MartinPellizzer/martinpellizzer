<p>Diporidium vaccinioides var. serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated-leaved bilberry, is a shrub native to the boreal and montane regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant features small, oval leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically pink or white, clustered in umbels.
