                    <h1>Davallia parvipinnula</h1>
<p>Davallia parvipinnula, commonly known as the small-leaf fern, is a delicate and compact fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are closely spaced and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care.</p>
