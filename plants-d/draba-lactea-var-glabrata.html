                    <h1>Draba lactea var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Draba lactea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, setting it apart from other Draba species.</p>
