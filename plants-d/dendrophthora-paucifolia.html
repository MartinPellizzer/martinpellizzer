                    <h1>Dendrophthora paucifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora paucifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, lanceolate leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which are specialized structures that attach to the host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative impacts on the health of its host trees.</p>
