                    <h1>Dinochloa macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Dinochloa macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are typically broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native waters, disrupting local biodiversity.</p>
