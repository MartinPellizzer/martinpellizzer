<p>Dactylorhiza comosa subsp.</p>
<p>cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the UK and parts of western Europe. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has erect, slender stems with few leaves and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are specialized for symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact inflorescence compared to other Dactylorhiza species.</p>
