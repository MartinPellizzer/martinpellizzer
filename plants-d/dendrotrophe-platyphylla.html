<p>Dendrotrophe platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, flat, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to certain regions of Australia and is often found in dry, open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
