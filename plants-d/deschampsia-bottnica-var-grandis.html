                    <h1>Deschampsia bottnica var. grandis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia bottnica var. grandis, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that often forms dense mats. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
