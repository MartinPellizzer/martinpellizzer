<p>Dicranopygium arusisense, commonly known as the Arus Island moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cushion-like growth form and vibrant green foliage, which thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a complex structure with closely packed leaves and a dense, fibrous stem system that aids in moisture retention. It plays a crucial role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
