                    <h1>Diplazium apicisorum</h1>
<p>Diplazium apicisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hartiya, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are narrow and elongated, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered in a layer of fine, brownish hairs.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.</p>
