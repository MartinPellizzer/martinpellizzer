                    <h1>Dichapetalum reygaertii</h1>
<p>Dichapetalum reygaertii, commonly known as the Zulu orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, particularly the Eastern Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique floral structure features two sepals and two petals, with the third petal modified into a labellum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
