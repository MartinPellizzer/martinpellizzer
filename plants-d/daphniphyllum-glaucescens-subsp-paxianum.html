<p>Daphniphyllum glaucescens subsp.</p>
<p>paxianum, commonly known as the Paxian silverleaf daphniphyllum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive silvery sheen.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
