<p>Dryopteris oligophylla, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a finely divided, feather-like appearance.</p>
