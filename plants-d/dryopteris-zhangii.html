                    <h1>Dryopteris zhangii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris zhangii, commonly known as Zhang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
