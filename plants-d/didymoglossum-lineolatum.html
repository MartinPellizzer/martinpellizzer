                    <h1>Didymoglossum lineolatum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum lineolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bog moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as peat bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>It has slender, curved leaves that are typically less than 5 millimeters long, with a distinctive midrib that is often more pronounced than the leaf margins. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are clustered in dense groups, typically on short, erect stems. Its reproductive structures are often covered by a peristome, a ring of tooth-like structures that aids in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum lineolatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and maintaining the hydrology of its wetland habitats.</p>
