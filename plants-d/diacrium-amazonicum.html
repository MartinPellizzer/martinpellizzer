                    <h1>Diacrium amazonicum</h1>
<p>Diacrium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian star fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the dense rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of the Amazon basin, where it attaches itself to trees and other vegetation. The plant features delicate, star-shaped fronds that are typically green with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater, adapting to the nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
