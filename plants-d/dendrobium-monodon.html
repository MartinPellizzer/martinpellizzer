                    <h1>Dendrobium monodon</h1>
<p>Dendrobium monodon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium monodon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
