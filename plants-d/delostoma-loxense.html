<p>Delostoma loxense, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its simple morphology includes branching stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Delostoma loxense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through its prey-trapping mechanism.</p>
