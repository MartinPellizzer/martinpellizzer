                    <h1>Desmiograstis</h1>
<p>Desmiograstis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a ghostly appearance. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
