<p>Dicliptera bivalvis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false pigeonwheat, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Dicliptera bivalvis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
