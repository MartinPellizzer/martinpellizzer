                    <h1>Doellingeria × sekimotoi</h1>
<p>Doellingeria × sekimotoi, commonly known as the hybrid giant horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Doellingeria torreyi* and *Doellingeria filifera*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in jointed, segmented structures that resemble the ancient horsetail plants. The plant lacks true flowers and reproduces vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a non-flowering, clonal species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies entirely on propagation through its underground stems.</p>
