                    <h1>Dalbergia villosa</h1>
<p>Dalbergia villosa, commonly known as the velvetwood or African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a fine, almost velvety texture, which makes it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
