                    <h1>Dipentodon longipedicellatus</h1>
<p>Dipentodon longipedicellatus, commonly known as the long-pedicellate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
