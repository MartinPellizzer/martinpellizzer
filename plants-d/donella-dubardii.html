                    <h1>Donella dubardii</h1>
<p>Donella dubardii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water. Its flowers are typically clustered in a single head, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Donella dubardii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
