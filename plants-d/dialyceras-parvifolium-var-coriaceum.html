                    <h1>Dialyceras parvifolium var. coriaceum</h1>
<p>Dialyceras parvifolium var. coriaceum, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
