<p>Danthoniastrum compactum, commonly known as the compact muhly, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a valuable component of native plant restoration projects.</p>
<p>Danthoniastrum compactum is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing sandy or gravelly landscapes.</p>
