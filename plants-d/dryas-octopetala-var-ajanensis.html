                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. ajanensis</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. ajanensis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Dryas genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits.</p>
