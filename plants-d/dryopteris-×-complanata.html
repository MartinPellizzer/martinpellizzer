                    <h1>Dryopteris × complanata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × complanata, commonly known as the Hart's-tongue fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris inopinata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
