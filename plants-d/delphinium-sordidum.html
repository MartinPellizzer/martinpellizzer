<p>Delphinium sordidum, commonly known as the gloomy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Delphinium sordidum is noted for its ornamental value but is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>
