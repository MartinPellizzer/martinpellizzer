<p>Driessenia microthrix var. pteroclada, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
