                    <h1>Dryopteris exigua</h1>
<p>Dryopteris exigua, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, dense rosette of leathery, dark green, shield-shaped fronds that remain upright throughout the year. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
