<p>Digrammaria, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of shrubs or small trees that are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red. Digrammaria species are often used in landscaping due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing coastal and riverbank soils.</p>
