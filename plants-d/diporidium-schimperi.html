<p>Diporidium schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian cactus, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It has small, paddle-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not a true cactus but a member of the tribe Ceropegieae.</p>
