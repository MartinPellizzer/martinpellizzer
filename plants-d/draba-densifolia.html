<p>Draba densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are dense, hairy, and often form a basal rosette, which helps to conserve moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Draba densifolia is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures.</p>
