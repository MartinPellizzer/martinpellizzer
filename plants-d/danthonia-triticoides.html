                    <h1>Danthonia triticoides</h1>
<p>Danthonia triticoides, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and forested wetlands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Danthonia triticoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils.</p>
