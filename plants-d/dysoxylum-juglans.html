                    <h1>Dysoxylum juglans</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum juglans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody fruits containing single seeds. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that facilitate oxygen absorption in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Dysoxylum juglans plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
