                    <h1>Dracontium pertusum</h1>
<p>Dracontium pertusum, commonly known as the creeping arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Dracontium pertusum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
