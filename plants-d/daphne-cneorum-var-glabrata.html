<p>Daphne cneorum var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
