                    <h1>Dudleya costifolia</h1>
<p>Dudleya costifolia, commonly known as the coast Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, usually in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in gardens to preserve its ecological and horticultural value.</p>
