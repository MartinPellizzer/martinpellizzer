<p>Digitaria marginata var. extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and floodplains. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
