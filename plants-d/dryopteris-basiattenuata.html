                    <h1>Dryopteris basiattenuata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
