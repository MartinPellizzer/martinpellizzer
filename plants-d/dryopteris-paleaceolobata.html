<p>Dryopteris paleaceolobata, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
