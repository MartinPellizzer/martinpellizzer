<p>Drosocarpium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed cup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cup-shaped thallus with a smooth, often reddish or orange-colored surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its fringed margins and distinctive coloration make it easily identifiable among other lichen species.</p>
