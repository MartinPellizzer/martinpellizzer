                    <h1>Diplazium angustatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland areas.</p>
<p>Diplazium angustatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
