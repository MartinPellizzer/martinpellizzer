<p>Diasperus anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Diasperus anderssonii is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
