                    <h1>Dendrophthora buxifolia</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora buxifolia, commonly known as the boxwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of boxwood trees.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes for additional energy. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions where boxwood trees are common.</p>
