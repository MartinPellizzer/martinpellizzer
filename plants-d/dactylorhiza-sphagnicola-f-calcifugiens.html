                    <h1>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. calcifugiens</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. calcifugiens, commonly known as the calcium-loving marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species adapted to calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. This orchid typically grows in moist, acidic peat bogs and is often found in association with sphagnum moss. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a conservation concern.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor, calcium-rich environments.</p>
