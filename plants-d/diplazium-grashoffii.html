<p>Diplazium grashoffii, commonly known as the Grashoff's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, feather-like segments. It produces spores rather than seeds, which it releases into the water for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for clean water, it is often used as an indicator of water quality in its habitat.</p>
