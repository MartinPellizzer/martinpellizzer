                    <h1>Dryopteris amurensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris amurensis, commonly known as the Amur shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of Russia, China, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
