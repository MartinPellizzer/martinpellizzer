<p>Drosera humilis, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Drosera humilis is a low-growing plant, often found in dense clusters, and is well adapted to its nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
