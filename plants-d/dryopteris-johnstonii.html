                    <h1>Dryopteris johnstonii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and it produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect light.</p>
