                    <h1>Deparia acuta var. liubaensis</h1>
<p>Deparia acuta var. liubaensis, commonly known as the Liubaensian shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'liubaensis' refers to its origin in the Liuba region, where it has been documented in local flora studies.</p>
