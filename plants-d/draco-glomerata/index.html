                            <h1>Draco Glomerata</h1>
<p>Clustered dragon's blood, scientifically known as Draco glomerata, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of bright red, fleshy, almost meat-like flowers that resemble tiny hearts. This unique appearance has earned it the common name "dragon's blood," though it is not related to the mythical substance of the same name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collectors worldwide.</p>
