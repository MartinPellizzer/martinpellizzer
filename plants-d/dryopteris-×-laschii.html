                    <h1>Dryopteris × laschii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × laschii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris erythrosora and Dryopteris carpathica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
