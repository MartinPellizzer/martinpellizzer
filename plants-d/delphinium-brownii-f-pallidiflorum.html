<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The foliage consists of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
