<p>Davallia puberula, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
