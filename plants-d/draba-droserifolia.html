                    <h1>Draba droserifolia</h1>
<p>Draba droserifolia, commonly known as the dewy bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, aiding in the capture of small insects.</p>
<p>This adaptation helps the plant supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
