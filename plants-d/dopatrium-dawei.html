                    <h1>Dopatrium dawei</h1>
<p>Dopatrium dawei, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous white or pale flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree, sometimes leading to its death.</p>
<p>Despite its negative impact on host plants, Dopatrium dawei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
