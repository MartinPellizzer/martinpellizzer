<p>Discocactus hartmannii, commonly known as the Hartmann's discocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical shape, with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding ornamental value. Its spiny areoles are covered with short, white hairs, which provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Discocactus hartmannii is well adapted to dry environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
