                    <h1>Dracula deltoidea</h1>
<p>Dracula deltoidea, commonly known as the delta orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador, it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, drooping inflorescences and vivid, often bi-colored flowers. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Dracula deltoidea is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
