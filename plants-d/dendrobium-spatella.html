<p>Dendrobium spatella, commonly known as the orchid of the desert, is a species of orchid native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in rocky or tree habitats. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrobium spatella is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
