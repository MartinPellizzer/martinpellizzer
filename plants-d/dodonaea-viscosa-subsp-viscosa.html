<p>Dodonaea viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a shrub native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
