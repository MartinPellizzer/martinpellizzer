                    <h1>Didymoglossum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked tasselgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically forms dense mats on moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are clustered in short, bristly spikes.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum aculeatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
