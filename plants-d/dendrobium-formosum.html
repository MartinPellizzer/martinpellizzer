                    <h1>Dendrobium formosum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium formosum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium formosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
