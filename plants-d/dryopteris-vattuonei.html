                    <h1>Dryopteris vattuonei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vattuonei, commonly known as the Vattuone wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive clusters called sori. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
