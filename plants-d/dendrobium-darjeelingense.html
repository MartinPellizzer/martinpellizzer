<p>Dendrobium darjeelingense, commonly known as the Darjeeling orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cane-like stems that are often branched and covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitudes and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
