<p>Dermatophyllum speciosum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has dark green, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowering stems are often branched and can grow up to 3 meters in height.</p>
<p>Dermatophyllum speciosum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
