                    <h1>Dyscritothamnus mirandae</h1>
<p>Dyscritothamnus mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dyscritothamnus mirandae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
