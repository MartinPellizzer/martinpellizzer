                            <h1>Donax Montanus</h1>
<p>Coastal buckthorn, scientifically known as Donax montanus, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. This plant is often found in dunes and along the shoreline, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its small, dark green leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers make it a distinctive feature of the coastal landscape. Despite its ecological importance, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, posing challenges to native plant communities.</p>
