                    <h1>Dryopteris fragrans var. remotiuscula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fragrans var. remotiuscula, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a variant of the fragrant fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
