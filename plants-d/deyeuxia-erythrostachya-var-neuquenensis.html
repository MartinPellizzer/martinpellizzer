<p>Deyeuxia erythrostachya var. neuquenensis, commonly known as the Neuqu√©n sedge, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color, giving it its species name.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
