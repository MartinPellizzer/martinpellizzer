                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. falcatula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. falcatula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Dryopteris.</p>
<p>It is a semi-aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often float on the surface of water. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form a network beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in moist environments and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
