                    <h1>Drosera aldrovanda</h1>
<p>Drosera aldrovanda, commonly known as the aquatic sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, water-filled leaves that are covered in sticky glands which trap insects. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, such as ponds or marshes. Its unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients from captured prey, compensating for the nutrient-poor environment in which it lives.</p>
<p>Drosera aldrovanda is also known for its ability to float and its rapid response to prey, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
