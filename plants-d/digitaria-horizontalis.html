                    <h1>Digitaria horizontalis</h1>
<p>Digitaria horizontalis, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. The plant has flat, spreading leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Digitaria horizontalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
