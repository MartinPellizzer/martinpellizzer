                    <h1>Dipholis stevensonii</h1>
<p>Dipholis stevensonii, commonly known as Stevenson's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant typically grows in swampy or marshy habitats, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and it relies on specific fungal associations for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
