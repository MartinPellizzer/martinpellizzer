<p>Drakaea andrewsiae, commonly known as the Andrews' spider-orchid, is an exquisite member of the orchid family native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance, with a single, slender flower that resembles a spider in both form and coloration. It thrives in heathland and woodland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces a single, pale green to yellowish flower with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider.</p>
<p>Drakaea andrewsiae is a rare and protected species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements that make it vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
