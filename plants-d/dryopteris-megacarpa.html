<p>Dryopteris megacarpa, commonly known as the giant barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct, fleshy structures called indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
