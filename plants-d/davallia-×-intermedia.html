                    <h1>Davallia × intermedia</h1>
<p>Davallia × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid fern or the silver sword fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Davallia canariensis and Davallia mariae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
