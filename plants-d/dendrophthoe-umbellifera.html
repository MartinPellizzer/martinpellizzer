                    <h1>Dendrophthoe umbellifera</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe umbellifera, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic compounds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Dendrophthoe umbellifera plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitats.</p>
