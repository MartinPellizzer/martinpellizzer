                    <h1>Dryopteris peekelii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris peekelii, commonly known as Peekel's wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, which contribute to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
