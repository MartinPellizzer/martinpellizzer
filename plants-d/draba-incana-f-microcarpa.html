<p>Draba incana f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its diminutive stature and is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
