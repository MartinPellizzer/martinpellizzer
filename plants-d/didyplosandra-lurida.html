                    <h1>Didyplosandra lurida</h1>
<p>Didyplosandra lurida, commonly known as the ghost lily, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and branching.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Didyplosandra lurida is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists.</p>
