<p>Danthonia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often exhibit a reddish-purple hue, especially during the flowering season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Danthonia purpurascens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
