                    <h1>Diplazium wheeleri</h1>
<p>Diplazium wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's snake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Diplazium wheeleri typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
