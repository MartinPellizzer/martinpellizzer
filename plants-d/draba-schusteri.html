<p>Draba schusteri, commonly known as Schuster's whitlow grass, is a small annual flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous species. The plant typically grows to a height of 5â€“15 cm and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
