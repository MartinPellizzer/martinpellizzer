<p>Deyeuxia macouniana, commonly known as the Macoun's flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive, flat, triangular stem.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia macouniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support local wildlife.</p>
