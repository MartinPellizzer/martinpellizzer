                    <h1>Dendrobium sikkimense</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sikkimense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
