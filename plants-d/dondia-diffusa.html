                    <h1>Dondia diffusa</h1>
<p>Dondia diffusa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, water, and support. Dondia diffusa is often found in agricultural fields and can be a nuisance to crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
