                    <h1>Disocactus phyllanthoides</h1>
<p>Disocactus phyllanthoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble orchids, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than the soil. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
