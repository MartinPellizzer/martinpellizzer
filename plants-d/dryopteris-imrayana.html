                    <h1>Dryopteris imrayana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris imrayana, commonly known as the Imray's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
