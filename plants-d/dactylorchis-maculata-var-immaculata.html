                    <h1>Dactylorchis maculata var. immaculata</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis maculata var. immaculata, commonly known as the immaculate dactylorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
