                    <h1>Diphyes oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Diphyes oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Diphyes oblanceolata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
