<p>Dryorkis tridris, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which typically bloom in late spring, come in shades of white and pale pink, adding a unique aesthetic to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
