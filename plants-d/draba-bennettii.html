                    <h1>Draba bennettii</h1>
<p>Draba bennettii, commonly known as Bennett's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Draba bennettii is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers.</p>
