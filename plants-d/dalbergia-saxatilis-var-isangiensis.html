<p>Dalbergia saxatilis var. isangiensis, commonly known as the Isangi ebony, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is prized for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forest areas and has a slow growth rate, contributing to its scarcity. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
