                    <h1>Deweya</h1>
<p>Deweya, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Deweya is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological gardens.</p>
