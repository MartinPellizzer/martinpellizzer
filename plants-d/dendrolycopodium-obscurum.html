<p>Dendrolycopodium obscurum, commonly known as the dark clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its primitive evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
