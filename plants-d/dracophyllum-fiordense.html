                    <h1>Dracophyllum fiordense</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum fiordense, commonly known as the Fiordland heath, is a shrub native to the rugged coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Dracophyllum fiordense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
