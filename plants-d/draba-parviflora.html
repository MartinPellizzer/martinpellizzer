                    <h1>Draba parviflora</h1>
<p>Draba parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Draba parviflora is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers.</p>
