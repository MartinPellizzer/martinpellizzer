<p>Dendrobium patentissimum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium patentissimum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display.</p>
