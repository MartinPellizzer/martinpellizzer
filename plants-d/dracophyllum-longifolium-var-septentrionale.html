                    <h1>Dracophyllum longifolium var. septentrionale</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum longifolium var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the subantarctic regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, dense, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
