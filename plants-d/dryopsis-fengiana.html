                    <h1>Dryopsis fengiana</h1>
<p>Dryopsis fengiana, commonly known as the Feng's dryopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally ovate and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dryopsis fengiana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
