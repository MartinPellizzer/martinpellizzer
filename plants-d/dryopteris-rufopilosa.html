<p>Dryopteris rufopilosa, commonly known as the rusty-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with rust-colored veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive upright growth habit.</p>
<p>Dryopteris rufopilosa produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
