                    <h1>Dendrophthora pedicellata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora pedicellata, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its red-brown stems and small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually bright red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth and health of its host trees, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful.</p>
