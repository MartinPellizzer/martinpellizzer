<p>Dendrobates, commonly known as poison dart frogs, are a group of brightly colored frogs native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>They are known for their vivid skin pigments, which often serve as a warning to predators about their toxicity. These frogs are typically found in humid tropical environments, such as rainforests, where they reside near streams or leaf litter. Their diet consists mainly of small arthropods, and they obtain their toxins from the insects they consume.</p>
<p>Dendrobates species exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns, which vary among different species and can be influenced by environmental factors.</p>
