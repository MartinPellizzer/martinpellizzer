<p>Damasonium, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, bright green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with four petals and five stamens, typical of the Onagraceae family.</p>
