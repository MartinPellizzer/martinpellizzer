                    <h1>Dryopteris costularis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris costularis, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a serrated margin. It produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, attractive colonies.</p>
