                    <h1>Diplectria stipularis</h1>
<p>Diplectria stipularis, commonly known as the stipular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are red or orange and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked.</p>
