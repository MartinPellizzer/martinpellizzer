                    <h1>Drosera ramentacea var. burchelliana</h1>
<p>Drosera ramentacea var. burchelliana, commonly known as the Burchell's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its rosette of leaves forms a dense, cushion-like structure, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
