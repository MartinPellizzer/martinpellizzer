                    <h1>Disporopsis</h1>
<p>Disporopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with thin, waxy leaves and a single, elongated flower. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this endangered species from habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
