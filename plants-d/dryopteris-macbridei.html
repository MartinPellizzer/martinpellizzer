<p>Dryopteris macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that is typical of many wood ferns.</p>
<p>This species is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial to full shade.</p>
