<p>Draba sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant has small, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing some insulation against the cold. Its flowers are yellow and appear in early summer, adding a bright touch to the otherwise muted landscape.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
