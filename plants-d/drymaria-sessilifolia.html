<p>Drymaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
