                    <h1>Diplazium deflexum</h1>
<p>Diplazium deflexum, commonly known as the flexed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often curved or flexed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
