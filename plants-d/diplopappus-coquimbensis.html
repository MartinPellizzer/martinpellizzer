<p>Diplopappus coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo burweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a two-valved capsule that releases seeds through a mechanism involving wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local fauna.</p>
