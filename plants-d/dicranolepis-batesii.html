<p>Dicranolepis batesii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is typically found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
