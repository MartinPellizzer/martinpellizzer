                    <h1>Draba incana var. ramosissima</h1>
<p>Draba incana var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of linear, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
