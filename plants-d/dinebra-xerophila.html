<p>Dinebra xerophila, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, waxy, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dinebra xerophila plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals.</p>
