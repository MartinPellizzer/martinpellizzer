                    <h1>Diplostephium tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Diplostephium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that are a common food source for birds. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This unique relationship with its host allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
