                    <h1>Delissea waioliensis</h1>
<p>Delissea waioliensis, commonly known as the Waioliensis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
