<p>Dryopteris platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to round fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
