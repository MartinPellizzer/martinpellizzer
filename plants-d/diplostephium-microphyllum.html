                    <h1>Diplostephium microphyllum</h1>
<p>Diplostephium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved burrgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which are followed by spiny, burr-like fruits. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
