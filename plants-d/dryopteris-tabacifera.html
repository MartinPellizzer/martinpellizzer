<p>Dryopteris tabacifera, commonly known as the tobacco fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
