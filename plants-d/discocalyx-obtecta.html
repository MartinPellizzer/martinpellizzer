                    <h1>Discocalyx obtecta</h1>
<p>Discocalyx obtecta, commonly known as the smooth bract fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lanceolate fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided and have a smooth, leathery texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
