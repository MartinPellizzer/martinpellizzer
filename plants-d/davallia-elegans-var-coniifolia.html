                    <h1>Davallia elegans var. coniifolia</h1>
<p>Davallia elegans var. coniifolia, commonly known as the fern with needle-like fronds, is a striking ornamental fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds that are dark green with a silvery-blue tint, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for indoor cultivation as well as outdoor gardens.</p>
