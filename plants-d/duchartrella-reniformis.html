<p>Duchartrella reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped thallus that is typically green and flat, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the thallus.</p>
<p>Duchartrella reniformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
