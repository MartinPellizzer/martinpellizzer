<p>Davallia divaricata var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a dark green color and a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>
