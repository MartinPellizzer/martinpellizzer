<p>Diplostephium jenesanum, commonly known as the Jenesan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, similar to other prickly pear species, which are encased in a thick, spiny rind. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry climates.</p>
