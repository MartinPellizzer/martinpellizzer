<p>Dactylorhiza × dinglensis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>smitakii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a tall, slender stem bearing a dense spike of violet to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
