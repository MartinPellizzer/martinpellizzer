<p>Dactylorhiza urvilleana subsp.</p>
<p>ilgazica, commonly known as the Ilgaz orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Turkey. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid species, and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. It is classified as a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique ecological niche and its role in the biodiversity of its native region.</p>
