                    <h1>Diplostephium cinerascens var. centrale</h1>
<p>Diplostephium cinerascens var. centrale, commonly known as the central silverleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
