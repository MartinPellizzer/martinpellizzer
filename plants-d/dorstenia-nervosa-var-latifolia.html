                    <h1>Dorstenia nervosa var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Dorstenia nervosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed zigzag plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and heart-shaped, broad leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
<p>The leaves are succulent, allowing the plant to store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
