<p>Drosera anglica var. woodii, commonly known as the English sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in bright red or reddish-brown secretory cells.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
