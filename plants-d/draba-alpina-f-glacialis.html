                    <h1>Draba alpina f. glacialis</h1>
<p>Draba alpina f. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it is adapted to harsh conditions such as strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil. It has hairy leaves and stems that help reduce water loss and protect against frost.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in high-altitude areas, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
