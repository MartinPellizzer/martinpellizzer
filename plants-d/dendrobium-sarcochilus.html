<p>Dendrobium sarcochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments rather than in the wild.</p>
