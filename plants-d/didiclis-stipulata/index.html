                            <h1>Didiclis Stipulata</h1>
<p>Didiclis stipulata is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family known for its vibrant, tubular flowers and unique foliage. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its foliage features distinctive leaf stipules that give it a distinctive appearance, while its flowers bloom in clusters of red, orange, or yellow. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Despite its beauty, Didiclis stipulata remains a lesser-known gem among plant enthusiasts.</p>
