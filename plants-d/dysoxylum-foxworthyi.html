<p>Dysoxylum foxworthyi, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, with large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in moist deciduous or semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
