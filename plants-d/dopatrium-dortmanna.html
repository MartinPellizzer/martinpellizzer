<p>Dopatrium dortmanna, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Dopatrium dortmanna plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats.</p>
