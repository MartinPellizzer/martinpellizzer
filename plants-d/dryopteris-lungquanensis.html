<p>Dryopteris lungquanensis, commonly known as the Lungquan fern, is a species of shield fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
