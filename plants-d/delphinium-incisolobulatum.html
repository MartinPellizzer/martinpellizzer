<p>Delphinium incisolobulatum, commonly known as the serrated-lobed larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially poisonous plant and should be handled with care.</p>
