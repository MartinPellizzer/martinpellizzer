<p>Doryopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Doryopteris hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
