                    <h1>Dicraeia erythrolichen</h1>
<p>Dicraeia erythrolichen, commonly known as the red lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure is characterized by a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, composed of interwoven fungal hyphae and algal cells. Dicraeia erythrolichen plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its vibrant red coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments produced by the algal component.</p>
