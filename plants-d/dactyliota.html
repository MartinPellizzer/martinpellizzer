<p>Dactyliota, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, with some extending into parts of Africa and Australia. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true dandelions. Dactyliota species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
