<p>Dipteracanthus sibua, commonly known as the Sibuyan star orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with red or purple markings. The plant has a slender stem and produces small, clustered leaves that help it cling to tree bark in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
