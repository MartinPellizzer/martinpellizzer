<p>Dendrobenthamia capitata var. emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>

The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
