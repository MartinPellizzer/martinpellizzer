                    <h1>Dryopteris bullata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris bullata, commonly known as the bullate wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, rounded shape and a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
