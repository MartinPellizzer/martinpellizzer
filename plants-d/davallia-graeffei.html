<p>Davallia graeffei, commonly known as the silver-veined hoya, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery vein pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Davallia graeffei is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
