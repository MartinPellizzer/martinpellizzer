                    <h1>Damasonium stellatum</h1>
<p>Damasonium stellatum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Damasonium stellatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
