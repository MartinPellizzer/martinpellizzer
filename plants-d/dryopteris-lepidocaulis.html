                    <h1>Dryopteris lepidocaulis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lepidocaulis, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
