<p>Dendrobium hasseltii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, making it relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
