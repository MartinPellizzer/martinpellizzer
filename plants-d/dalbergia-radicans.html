                    <h1>Dalbergia radicans</h1>
<p>Dalbergia radicans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
