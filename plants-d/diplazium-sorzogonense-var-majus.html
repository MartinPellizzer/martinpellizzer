                    <h1>Diplazium sorzogonense var. majus</h1>
<p>Diplazium sorzogonense var. majus, commonly known as the giant fork fern, is a variant of the fork fern genus Diplazium native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dichotomously branched fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clusters arranged in clusters on the undersides of the pinnae.</p>
