<p>Dryopteris lilloi, commonly known as Lillo's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteris genus, which includes many species of wood ferns characterized by their intricate fronds. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Lillo's wood fern prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes.</p>
