<p>Dryopteris multiseta, commonly known as the many-hairs shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that includes a central stalk and multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
