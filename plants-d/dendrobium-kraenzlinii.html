<p>Dendrobium kraenzlinii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive golden hue during the flowering season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium kraenzlinii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
