                    <h1>Delphinium ajacis var. majus</h1>
<p>Delphinium ajacis var. majus, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though its toxic alkaloids make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
