                    <h1>Dicranolepis disticha f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Dicranolepis disticha f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous dichotomy fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically slender and exhibit a glabrous, or hairless, surface, which is a key feature of this particular form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
