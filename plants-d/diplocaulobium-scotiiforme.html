                    <h1>Diplocaulobium scotiiforme</h1>
<p>Diplocaulobium scotiiforme, commonly known as the Scottish fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
