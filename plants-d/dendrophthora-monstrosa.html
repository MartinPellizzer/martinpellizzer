                    <h1>Dendrophthora monstrosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora monstrosa, commonly known as the monstrous wood parasite, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to absorb water and minerals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>While it can cause stress to its host, it plays a role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
