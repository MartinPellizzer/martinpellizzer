                    <h1>Dactylostemon oligandrus var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Dactylostemon oligandrus var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rock fig, is a rare and woody shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
