<p>Duroia eriopila, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries containing small, hard seeds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, short hairs.</p>
