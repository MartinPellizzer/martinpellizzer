                    <h1>Drymaria crassifolia</h1>
<p>Drymaria crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria crassifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
