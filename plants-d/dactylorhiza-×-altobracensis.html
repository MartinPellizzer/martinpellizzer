                    <h1>Dactylorhiza × altobracensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza × altobracensis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it survive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, contributing to its genetic diversity.</p>
