                    <h1>Davallia inaequalis</h1>
<p>Davallia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant prefers shady, humid environments and is often found growing in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, green, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous layer.</p>
