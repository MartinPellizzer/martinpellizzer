                    <h1>Drymaria cubana</h1>
<p>Drymaria cubana, commonly known as Cuban starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria cubana is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and dry conditions.</p>
