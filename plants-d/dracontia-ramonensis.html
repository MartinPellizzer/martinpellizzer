<p>Dracontia ramonensis, commonly known as the Ramon's dragon fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned along the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Dracontia ramonensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
