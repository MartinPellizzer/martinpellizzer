<p>Dactylis × intercedens f. stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked couch grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that are often hirsute, with small, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical traits make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage crop in certain regions.</p>
