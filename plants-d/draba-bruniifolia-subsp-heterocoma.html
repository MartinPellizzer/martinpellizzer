<p>Draba bruniifolia subsp.</p>
<p>heterocoma, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground.</p>
<p>The plant features small, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies heterocoma is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other Draba species.</p>
