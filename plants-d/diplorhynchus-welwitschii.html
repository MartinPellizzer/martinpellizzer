<p>Diplorhynchus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that allows it to survive in extremely arid conditions by accessing deep underground water sources. Diplorhynchus welwitschii is also notable for its ability to produce a resin that has been historically used by local communities.</p>
<p>This plant is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years.</p>
