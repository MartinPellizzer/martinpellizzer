<p>Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp.</p>
<p>refractisquamatus, commonly known as the Johnston's tree heath, is a rare and distinctive succulent native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
