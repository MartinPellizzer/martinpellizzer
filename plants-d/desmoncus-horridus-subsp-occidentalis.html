<p>Desmoncus horridus subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western burrweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a prickly, bristly structure, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
