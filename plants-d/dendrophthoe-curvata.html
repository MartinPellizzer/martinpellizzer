                    <h1>Dendrophthoe curvata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe curvata, commonly known as the twisted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress on its host trees, particularly in dense populations.</p>
