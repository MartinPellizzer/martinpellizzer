                    <h1>Dieffenbachia picta var. angustior</h1>
<p>Dieffenbachia picta var. angustior, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Dieffenbachia, is a tropical houseplant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Dieffenbachia picta. The foliage often features a mix of green, white, and cream-colored patterns, creating a visually appealing contrast. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the plant is toxic if ingested, so it should be kept away from pets and small children.</p>
