<p>Digitaria leucites var. glabella, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its low yield and susceptibility to drought.</p>
