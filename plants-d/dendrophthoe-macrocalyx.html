                    <h1>Dendrophthoe macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and clusters of small, white, fleshy flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
