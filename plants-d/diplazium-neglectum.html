                    <h1>Diplazium neglectum</h1>
<p>Diplazium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation through aquatic dispersal.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dichotomously divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance in aquatic habitats.</p>
