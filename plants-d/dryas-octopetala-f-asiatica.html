                    <h1>Dryas octopetala f. asiatica</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala f. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian mountain avens, is a cold-hardy perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain heat and resist frost. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>
