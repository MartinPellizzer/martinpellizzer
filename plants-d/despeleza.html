                    <h1>Despeleza</h1>
<p>Despeleza, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique species native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a type of epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are thin and translucent, allowing light to pass through, which gives it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in the ecosystem but is valued for its unusual appearance and ecological niche.</p>
