                    <h1>Diasperus debilis</h1>
<p>Diasperus debilis, commonly known as the slender sandverbena, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Diasperus debilis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
