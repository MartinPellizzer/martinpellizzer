<p>Donella ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrensis fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Donella ambrensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
