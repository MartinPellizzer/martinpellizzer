                    <h1>Dyckia microcalyx</h1>
<p>Dyckia microcalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in a terminal spike, which can be either green or reddish in color. Dyckia microcalyx is adapted to grow in sunny, well-drained environments, often in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
