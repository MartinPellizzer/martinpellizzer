<p>Digitaria maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute grains of seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Digitaria maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
