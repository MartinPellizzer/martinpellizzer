                    <h1>Dryopteris aquilinoides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aquilinoides, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
