<p>Dudleya cymosa subsp.</p>
<p>cymosa, commonly known as the Coast Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
