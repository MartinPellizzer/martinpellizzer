<p>Delosperma badspoortense, commonly known as the Badspoortense ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
