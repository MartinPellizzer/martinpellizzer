                    <h1>Dorstenia djettii</h1>
<p>Dorstenia djettii, commonly known as the "bottle plant," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its striking, swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Dorstenia djettii is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>
