<p>Dendrobium esuriens, commonly known as the starry orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium esuriens is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
