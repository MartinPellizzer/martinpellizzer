                    <h1>Diplazium sibiricum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Diplazium sibiricum var. glabrum, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a variant of the broadleaf water fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs or茸毛. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands, where it can form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
