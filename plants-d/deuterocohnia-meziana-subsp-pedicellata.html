<p>Deuterocohnia meziana subsp.</p>
<p>pedicellata, commonly known as the Ecuadorian rock fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It features a rosette of fiddlehead-like, spore-bearing fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, well-draining conditions.</p>
