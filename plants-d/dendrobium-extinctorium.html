                    <h1>Dendrobium extinctorium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium extinctorium, commonly known as the firefly orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that resemble fireflies, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing delicate yellow-green flowers with a subtle bioluminescent glow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
