                    <h1>Dryopteris tenera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris tenera, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
