                    <h1>Drymaria ovata</h1>
<p>Drymaria ovata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in dry conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Drymaria ovata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
