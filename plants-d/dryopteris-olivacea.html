                    <h1>Dryopteris olivacea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
