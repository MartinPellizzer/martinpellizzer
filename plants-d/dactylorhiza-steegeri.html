<p>Dactylorhiza steegeri, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or pink flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is relatively easy to cultivate in moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
