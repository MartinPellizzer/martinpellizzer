                    <h1>Dracaena rothiana</h1>
<p>Dracaena rothiana, commonly known as the silver dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a striking silver-gray color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena rothiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements.</p>
