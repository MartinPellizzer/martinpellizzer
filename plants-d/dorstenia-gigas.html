<p>Dorstenia gigas, commonly known as the giant false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a single flower but is actually a cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a spadix and a spathe. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Dorstenia gigas is also noted for its unique ability to store water in its stem, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
