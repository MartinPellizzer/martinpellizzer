<p>Dryopteris austriaca subsp.</p>
<p>assimilis, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and have a light green color.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
