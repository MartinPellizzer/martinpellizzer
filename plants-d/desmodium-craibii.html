<p>Desmodium craibii, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Desmodium craibii is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value.</p>
