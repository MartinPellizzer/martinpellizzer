<p>Diacarpa, commonly known as the "buttercup tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Diacarpa species are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations.</p>
