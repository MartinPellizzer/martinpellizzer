                    <h1>Dendrophthora constricta</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the branches of oak and pine trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its remaining chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to most animals but are consumed by specific bird species that disperse its seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora constricta plays a unique ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree health and providing food for specialized wildlife.</p>
