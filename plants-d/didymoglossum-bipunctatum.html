<p>Didymoglossum bipunctatum, commonly known as the two-spotted bladderwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It has thin, delicate leaves that are often submerged, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in whorls.</p>
<p>Didymoglossum bipunctatum is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to obtain nutrients from captured prey.</p>
