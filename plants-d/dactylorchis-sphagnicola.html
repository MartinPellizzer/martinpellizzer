                    <h1>Dactylorchis sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic bogs and sphagnum moss habitats, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss, which helps retain moisture in its swampy environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
