                    <h1>Diplazium armatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium armatum, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant features fronds that are divided into pinnae, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Diplazium armatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
