<p>Dionaea uniflora, commonly known as the sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant. The plant's leaves are typically rosette-shaped and can curl around prey to aid in digestion. It produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is usually pink or reddish in color.</p>
<p>Dionaea uniflora thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires high humidity and abundant sunlight to flourish.</p>
