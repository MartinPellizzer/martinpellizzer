                    <h1>Draba × incerta</h1>
<p>Draba × incerta, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba auriculata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, Draba × incerta shows genetic variability and is often found in areas where the parent species overlap.</p>
