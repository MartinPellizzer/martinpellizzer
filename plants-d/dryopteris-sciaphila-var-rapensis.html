                    <h1>Dryopteris sciaphila var. rapensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sciaphila var. rapensis, commonly known as the Rapeseed Shield Fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest understories.</p>
