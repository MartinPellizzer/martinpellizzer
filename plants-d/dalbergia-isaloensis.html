<p>Dalbergia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isole√±o rosewood, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a distinctive grain pattern. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and high demand for its valuable timber, it is heavily threatened by deforestation and illegal logging.</p>
