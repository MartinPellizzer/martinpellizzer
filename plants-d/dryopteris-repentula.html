<p>Dryopteris repentula, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris repentula is often found growing in clusters on rocky or humus-rich soil.</p>
