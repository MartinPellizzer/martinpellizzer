<p>Diervilla × wagneri, commonly known as the compact firethorn, is a hybrid shrub that combines traits from Diervilla roborowskii and Diervilla sinensis.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant red berries and dense, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly glossy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, ripen in the fall and provide food for birds.</p>
