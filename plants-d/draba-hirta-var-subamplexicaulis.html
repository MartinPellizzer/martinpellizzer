                    <h1>Draba hirta var. subamplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Draba hirta var. subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single umbel. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes or gravelly ground.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
