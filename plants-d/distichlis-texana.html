<p>Distichlis texana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
