<p>Dendrobium minutum, commonly known as the minute dendrobium, is a small orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Dendrobium minutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
