                    <h1>Dodonaea hispidula var. arida</h1>
<p>Dodonaea hispidula var. arida, commonly known as the desert Dodonaea, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are often branched and can become twisted with age, providing structural support in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
