                    <h1>Davallia mucronata</h1>
<p>Davallia mucronata, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Davallia mucronata prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings.</p>
