                    <h1>Digitaria compacta</h1>
<p>Digitaria compacta, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Digitaria compacta is often used in landscaping and for erosion control because of its hardiness and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
