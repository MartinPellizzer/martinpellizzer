                    <h1>Dendrobium subintegrum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium subintegrum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium subintegrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
