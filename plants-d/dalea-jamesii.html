                    <h1>Dalea jamesii</h1>
<p>Dalea jamesii, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and a short growing season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Dalea jamesii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
