                    <h1>Dipteryx oppositifolia var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Dipteryx oppositifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate, and its distinctive, elongated pods containing multiple seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The tree produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which requires specific conditions to open and release the nuts.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
