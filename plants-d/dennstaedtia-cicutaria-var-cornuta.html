                    <h1>Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. cornuta</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia cicutaria var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned water fern, is a variant of the water fern native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often bear spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in temperate regions. Its fronds are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>This fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
