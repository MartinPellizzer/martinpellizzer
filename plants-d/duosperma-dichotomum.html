                    <h1>Duosperma dichotomum</h1>
<p>Duosperma dichotomum, commonly known as the two-seeded dichotomous plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branched structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Duosperma dichotomum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience to drought.</p>
