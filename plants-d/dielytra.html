<p>Dielytra, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Dielytra species are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and supporting various insect populations.</p>
