<p>Diplotaxis decipiens, commonly known as the false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
