                    <h1>Dichopus</h1>
<p>Dichopus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble small, ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Dichopus species typically have finely divided leaves and produce small, white or pale yellow blooms.</p>
<p>These plants are often grown as ornamentals due to their striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
