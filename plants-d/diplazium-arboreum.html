<p>Diplazium arboreum, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the trunk formed by the accumulation of dead fronds around the base. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Diplazium arboreum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests.</p>
