                    <h1>Dendrobium pseudolamellatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium pseudolamellatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like structure that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium pseudolamellatum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
