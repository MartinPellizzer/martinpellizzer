<p>Dryopteris cystolepidota, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. It produces small, brownish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
