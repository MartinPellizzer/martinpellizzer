                    <h1>Deina polonica</h1>
<p>Deina polonica, commonly known as the Polish lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus and is often found on tree bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its pigmentation and nutrient acquisition. Its slow growth rate makes it a valuable indicator of environmental conditions and air quality.</p>
<p>Deina polonica is relatively rare and is of interest to mycologists and conservationists due to its ecological significance.</p>
