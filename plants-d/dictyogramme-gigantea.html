<p>Dictyogramme gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has feathery, delicate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are capable of floating on the water surface, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
