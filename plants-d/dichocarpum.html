<p>Dichocarpum, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate and alpine regions, often growing in rocky or forested habitats. The genus includes several species, many of which are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Dichocarpum species usually have basal leaves that are simple and alternate, with some species exhibiting a rosette growth form.</p>
