<p>Dendrobium angustitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive narrow lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium angustitepalum thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
