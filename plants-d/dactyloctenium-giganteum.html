                    <h1>Dactyloctenium giganteum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium giganteum, commonly known as giant fingergrass, is a tropical annual grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and long, slender leaves that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Dactyloctenium giganteum is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can compete heavily with crops.</p>
