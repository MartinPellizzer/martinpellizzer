<p>Deverra reboudii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Deverra reboudii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
