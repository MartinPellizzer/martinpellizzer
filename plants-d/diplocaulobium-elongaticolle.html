<p>Diplocaulobium elongaticolle, commonly known as the long-colled diplocaulobium, is a rare and specialized moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often recurved and have a distinct, glossy appearance. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on acidic, shaded soils, typically in moist, temperate forest environments. Its reproductive structures, including the elongated capsules, are positioned at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
