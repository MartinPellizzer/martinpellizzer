<p>Dryopteris securidiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Dryopteris securidiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
