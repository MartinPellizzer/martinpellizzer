                    <h1>Darea rhizophylla</h1>
<p>Darea rhizophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its specialized adaptations to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses rhizomes that anchor it firmly in crevices, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. The plant's fronds are typically small and leathery, reducing water loss in harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the rock crevices, contributing to its elusive nature.</p>
<p>Darea rhizophylla plays a vital role in stabilizing rocky soils and supporting microhabitats in its native range.</p>
