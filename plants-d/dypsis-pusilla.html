<p>Dypsis pusilla, commonly known as the miniature areca palm, is a compact, slow-growing palm native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a short, slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white flowers. The plant has feather-like, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dypsis pusilla is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
