                <h1>Dendrobium humilicolle</h1>
<p>Dendrobium humilicolle, commonly known as the lowland orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct lip that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium humilicolle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivated conditions.</p>
