<p>Dryopteris subpycnopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
