<p>Dryopteris devolvens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that gives the plant a refined aesthetic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it a valuable addition to rain gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
