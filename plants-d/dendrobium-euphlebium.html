<p>Dendrobium euphlebium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium euphlebium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
