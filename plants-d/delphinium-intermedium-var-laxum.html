                    <h1>Delphinium intermedium var. laxum</h1>
<p>Delphinium intermedium var. laxum, commonly known as the lax flower delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly found in cultivation compared to other delphinium species, making it a rare and sought-after addition to botanical collections.</p>
