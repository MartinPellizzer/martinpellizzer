                    <h1>Dactiphyllon</h1>
<p>Dactiphyllon, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a genus of red algae belonging to the family Dactypteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, filamentous thallus that often forms dense, bushy growths on rocky substrates in marine environments. The plant typically exhibits a reddish or brownish coloration, which helps it absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Dactiphyllon species are found in coastal areas, particularly in the intertidal and subtidal zones of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>These algae play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
