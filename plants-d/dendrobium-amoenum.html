<p>Dendrobium amoenum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive green throat, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium amoenum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
