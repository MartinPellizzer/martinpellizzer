<p>Dolichochaete nodiglumis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the genus Cucurbita. Its slender, yellowish stems are covered in small, sticky pads that help it adhere to its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to thrive as a hemiparasite in various agricultural and natural environments.</p>
