<p>Dermatophyllum arizonicum, commonly known as the Arizona milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also an important food source for certain species of butterflies, particularly the milkweed beetle.</p>
