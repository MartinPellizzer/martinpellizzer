<p>Dittrichia viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-adapted to arid and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes.</p>
