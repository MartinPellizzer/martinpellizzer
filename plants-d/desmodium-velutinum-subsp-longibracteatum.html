<p>Desmodium velutinum subsp.</p>
<p>longibracteatum, commonly known as the hairy desmodium, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The subspecies longibracteatum is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower cluster, setting it apart from other Desmodium species.</p>
