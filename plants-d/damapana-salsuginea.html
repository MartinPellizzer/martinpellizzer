<p>Damapana salsuginea, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Damapana salsuginea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
