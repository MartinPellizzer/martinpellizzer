                    <h1>Daboecia cantabrica f. alba</h1>
<p>Daboecia cantabrica f. alba, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a rare and striking variant of the rock rose species native to the coastal regions of northern Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs and heathlands. The plant is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
