<p>Drynaria nuda, commonly known as the naked tree fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, light green fronds that grow in a spiral pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the rachis.</p>
<p>Drynaria nuda prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
