                    <h1>Delphinium maritimum</h1>
<p>Delphinium maritimum, commonly known as the sea delphinium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty coastal environments.</p>
<p>Delphinium maritimum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores.</p>
