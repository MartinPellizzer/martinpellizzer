                    <h1>Diplostelma bellioides</h1>
<p>Diplostelma bellioides, commonly known as the bell-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, clustered leaves and white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that are typically dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
