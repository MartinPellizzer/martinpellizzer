                    <h1>Disperis fanniniae</h1>
<p>Disperis fanniniae, commonly known as the Fannin's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
