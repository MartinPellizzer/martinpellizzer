                    <h1>Diplazium × neobirii</h1>
<p>Diplazium × neobirii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sylvestre.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces both sterile and fertile spore-bearing structures, though it is primarily known for its ornamental value rather than its reproductive capabilities.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
