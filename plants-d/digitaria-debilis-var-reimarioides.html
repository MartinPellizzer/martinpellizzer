<p>Digitaria debilis var. reimarioides, commonly known as the dwarf fingergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, tufted growth habit and its role in soil stabilization in certain ecosystems.</p>
