                    <h1>Decaneurum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Decaneurum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed decaneurum, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Decaneurum angustifolium is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
