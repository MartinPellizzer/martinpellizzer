                    <h1>Dichroa schumanniana</h1>
<p>Dichroa schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's dichroa, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, two-toned leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying a deep red or purple on one side and a greenish-yellow on the other. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture.</p>
<p>Dichroa schumanniana is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
