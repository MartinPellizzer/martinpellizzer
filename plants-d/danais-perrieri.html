The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in shades of white and pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danais perrieri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
