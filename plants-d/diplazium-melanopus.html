<p>Diplazium melanopus, commonly known as the black-stemmed fork fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, forked fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium melanopus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
