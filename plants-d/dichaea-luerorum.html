                    <h1>Dichaea luerorum</h1>
<p>Dichaea luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent green leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea luerorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
