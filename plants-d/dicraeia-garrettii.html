                    <h1>Dicraeia garrettii</h1>
<p>Dicraeia garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the cycad family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
