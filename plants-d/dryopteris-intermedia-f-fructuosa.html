                    <h1>Dryopteris intermedia f. fructuosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris intermedia f. fructuosa, commonly known as the fruiting intermediate wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique fructification features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fronds that are typically shorter and more robust compared to the species. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are notably clustered and often surrounded by a distinctive indusium, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This fern is prized in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
