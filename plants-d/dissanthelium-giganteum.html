<p>Dissanthelium giganteum, commonly known as giant broomgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, upright stems and large, broad leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense panicles of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock.</p>
