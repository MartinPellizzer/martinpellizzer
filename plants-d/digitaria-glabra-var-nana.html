                    <h1>Digitaria glabra var. nana</h1>
<p>Digitaria glabra var. nana, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist or wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has short, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It is characterized by its compact stature, which is due to its naturally dwarfed growth habit.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
