<p>Dendrobium novae-hiberniae, commonly known as the Irish orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ireland.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range.</p>
