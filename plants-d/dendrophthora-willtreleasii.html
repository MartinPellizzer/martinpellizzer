                    <h1>Dendrophthora willtreleasii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora willtreleasii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds through bird droppings, allowing it to colonize new host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
