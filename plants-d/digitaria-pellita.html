<p>Digitaria pellita, commonly known as slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Digitaria pellita is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
