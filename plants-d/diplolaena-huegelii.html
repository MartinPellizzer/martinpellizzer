                    <h1>Diplolaena huegelii</h1>
<p>Diplolaena huegelii, commonly known as the coastal diplolaena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
