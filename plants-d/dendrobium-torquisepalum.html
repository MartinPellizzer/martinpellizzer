<p>Dendrobium torquisepalum, commonly known as the twisted lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and a few pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, twisted lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
