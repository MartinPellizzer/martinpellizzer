<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>punctata, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature a pattern of dark brown to black spots along the veins.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
