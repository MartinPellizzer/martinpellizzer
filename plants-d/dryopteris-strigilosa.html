                    <h1>Dryopteris strigilosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris strigilosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
