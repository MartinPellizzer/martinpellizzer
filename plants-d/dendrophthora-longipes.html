                    <h1>Dendrophthora longipes</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish-gray in color. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is often found growing on tree bark, particularly on conifers and broadleaf trees.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
