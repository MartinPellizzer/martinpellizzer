                    <h1>Diplodium bryophilum</h1>
<p>Diplodium bryophilum, commonly known as the moss fern, is a small, delicate plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant's fronds are typically short and clustered, with a soft, velvety texture. Diplodium bryophilum is often found growing on decaying wood or in dense mossy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations in humid, forested ecosystems.</p>
