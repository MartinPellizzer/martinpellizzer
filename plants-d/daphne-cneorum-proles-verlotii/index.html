                            <h1>Daphne Cneorum Proles Verlotii</h1>
<p>Caucasian daphne, scientifically known as Daphne cneorum proles verlotii, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. This species belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers and glossy evergreen foliage. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and requires careful handling due to its potent chemical compounds. The plant is often cultivated in specialized gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance. Its limited distribution and delicate nature make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
