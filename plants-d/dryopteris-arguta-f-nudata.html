                    <h1>Dryopteris arguta f. nudata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris arguta f. nudata, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive lack of fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is native to regions of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sterile fronds are reduced to a cluster of short, sparsely branched stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more compact than in the typical form.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>
