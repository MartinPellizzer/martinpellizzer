<p>Desmoncus horridus subsp.</p>
<p>palustris, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or emergent, depending on the water level.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in aquatic environments through its unique trapping mechanism.</p>
