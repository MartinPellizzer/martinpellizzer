                    <h1>Drosera × sidjamesii</h1>
<p>Drosera × sidjamesii, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera indica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects. This hybrid is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It typically grows in wet, boggy environments and thrives in high humidity.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
