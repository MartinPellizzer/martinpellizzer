<p>Dryopteris corazonensis, commonly known as the Corazon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching in growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
