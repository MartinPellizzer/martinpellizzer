<p>Draba inferalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine regions, where it adapts to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Draba inferalpina is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of alpine vegetation in Europe.</p>
