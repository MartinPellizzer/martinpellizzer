                    <h1>Dictyogramme griffithii</h1>
<p>Dictyogramme griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Dictyogramme griffithii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
