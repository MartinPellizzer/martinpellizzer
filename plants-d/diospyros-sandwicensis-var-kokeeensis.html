                    <h1>Diospyros sandwicensis var. kokeeensis</h1>
<p>Diospyros sandwicensis var. kokeeensis, commonly known as the Kokee persimmon, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree with rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often contain a gritty texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within mesic to wet forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation programs.</p>
