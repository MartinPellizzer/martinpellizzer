                    <h1>Dryopteris propinqua</h1>
<p>Dryopteris propinqua, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only sterile fronds and the second year producing fertile spore-bearing fronds. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage, which helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
