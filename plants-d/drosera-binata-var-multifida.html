                    <h1>Drosera binata var. multifida</h1>
<p>Drosera binata var. multifida, commonly known as the multifid tentacle sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, sticky tentacles that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely divided, multifid leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
