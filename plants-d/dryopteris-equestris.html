                    <h1>Dryopteris equestris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris equestris, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often drooping fronds that resemble the tail of a horse, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile fronds at the base and fertile fronds at the tip, which produce spores.</p>
