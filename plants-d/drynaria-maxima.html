                    <h1>Drynaria maxima</h1>
<p>Drynaria maxima, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to grow in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in D. maxima.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
