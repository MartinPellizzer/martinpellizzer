<p>Drosera indica f. robusta, commonly known as the Indian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with broad, spoon-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its robust growth compared to other forms of Drosera indica.</p>
