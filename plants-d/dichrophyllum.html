                    <h1>Dichrophyllum</h1>
<p>Dichrophyllum, commonly known as the two-colored plant, is a unique species characterized by its striking color variation in its foliage.</p>
<p>It typically features leaves that display two distinct colors, often green on one side and a contrasting hue such as red or purple on the other. This color change is primarily due to the presence of different pigments in the upper and lower epidermis layers of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant physiology and evolutionary biology.</p>
