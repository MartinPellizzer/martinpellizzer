                    <h1>Dankia</h1>
<p>Dankia, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like leaves that can appear almost spectral in appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Dankia is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and unusual appearance make it a popular subject for botanical study and aquarium cultivation.</p>
