<p>Dodecatheon alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>majus, commonly known as the Alpine Crownbeard, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of showy, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a crown-like pattern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
