                    <h1>Dendrophthoe pendula</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe pendula, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent through its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its aerial stems hang from the host tree, forming dense clusters that can resemble a curtain or veil.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe pendula is often found in humid environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species.</p>
