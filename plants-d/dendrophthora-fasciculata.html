                    <h1>Dendrophthora fasciculata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered ghost fern, is a unique and rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green with a translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the underside of its leaves, a feature that contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
