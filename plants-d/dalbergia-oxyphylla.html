                    <h1>Dalbergia oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Dalbergia oxyphylla, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and rich aroma, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also classified as an endangered species.</p>
