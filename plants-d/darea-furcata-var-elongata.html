                    <h1>Darea furcata var. elongata</h1>
<p>Darea furcata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its elongated, slender stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow and form a single, composite head, which later develops into a fluffy seed head.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its extended stem length compared to the typical dandelion, making it easily distinguishable in the field.</p>
