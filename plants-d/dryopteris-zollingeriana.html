<p>Dryopteris zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
