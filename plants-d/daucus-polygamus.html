                    <h1>Daucus polygamus</h1>
<p>Daucus polygamus, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble a lace doily. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure called a schizocarp, which releases small, curved seeds.</p>
<p>Daucus polygamus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
