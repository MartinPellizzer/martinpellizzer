<p>Drosanthemum montaguense, commonly known as the Montagu's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Drosanthemum montaguense is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
