                    <h1>Dryopteris deflexa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris deflexa, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a distinctive, elongated pattern on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
