                    <h1>Dracophyllum continentis</h1>
<p>Dracophyllum continentis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Dracophyllum continentis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
