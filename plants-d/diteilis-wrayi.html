<p>Diteilis wrayi, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Diteilis wrayi is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates high salinity and strong coastal winds.</p>
