<p>Deparia dickasonii, commonly known as the Dickason's wood fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces primarily through sexual reproduction, although it can also spread vegetatively through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deparia dickasonii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
