                    <h1>Drosera nitidula var. allantostigma</h1>
<p>Drosera nitidula var. allantostigma, commonly known as the pale sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sticky leaves covered in glandular hairs that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced stigma and pale coloration compared to the typical form of Drosera nitidula.</p>
