<p>Dendrobium ejirii, commonly known as the Korean orchid, is a species of orchid native to South Korea.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring and early summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium ejirii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
