<p>Dictyostega costata, commonly known as the serrated liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant forms a dense, carpet-like growth on moist, shaded soils, often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Dictyostega costata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
