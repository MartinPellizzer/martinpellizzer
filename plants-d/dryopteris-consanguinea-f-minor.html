                    <h1>Dryopteris consanguinea f. minor</h1>
<p>Dryopteris consanguinea f. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are usually smaller than those of the species, with a more compact and refined appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in this genus.</p>
