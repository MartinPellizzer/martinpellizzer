<p>Draba demareei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
