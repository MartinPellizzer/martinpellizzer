<p>Dendropanax portlandianus, commonly known as the Portland tree fern, is a distinctive plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a unique ability to regenerate from its rootstock, allowing it to form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
