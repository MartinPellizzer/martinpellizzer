<p>Dendrobium stelliferum, commonly known as the star-laden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them.

Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium stelliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, star-shaped blooms.</p>
