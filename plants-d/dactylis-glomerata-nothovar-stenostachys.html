                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata nothovar. stenostachys</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata nothovar. stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked couch grass, is a hybrid grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It exhibits a more upright and slender stem structure compared to the typical Dactylis glomerata, with narrower leaves and reduced inflorescence size. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and grassland habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant's genetic makeup reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from both parent species.</p>
