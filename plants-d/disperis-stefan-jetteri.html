                    <h1>Disperis stefan-jetteri</h1>
<p>Disperis stefan-jetteri, commonly known as the Stefan-Jetter's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania, where it thrives in cool, moist microhabitats. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique structure that resembles a spider, a characteristic feature of many Disperis species. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, highlighting its ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
