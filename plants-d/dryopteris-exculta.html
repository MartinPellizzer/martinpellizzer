                    <h1>Dryopteris exculta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris exculta, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely packed and form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes.</p>
