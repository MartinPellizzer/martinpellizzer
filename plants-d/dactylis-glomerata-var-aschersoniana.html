<p>Dactylis glomerata var. aschersoniana, commonly known as the Ascherson's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of tightly packed clusters of small flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
