<p>Derwentia derwentiana subsp.</p>
<p>anisodonta, commonly known as the Derwent River fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a complex, lace-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of significant botanical interest due to its evolutionary history and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
