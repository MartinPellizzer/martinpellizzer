                    <h1>Dryopteris × ambroseae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × ambroseae, commonly known as the Ambrose's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
