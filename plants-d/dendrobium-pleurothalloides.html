                    <h1>Dendrobium pleurothalloides</h1>
<p>Dendrobium pleurothalloides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium pleurothalloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
