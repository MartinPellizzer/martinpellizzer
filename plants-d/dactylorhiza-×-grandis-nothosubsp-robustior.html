<p>Dactylorhiza × grandis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>robustior, commonly known as the robust greater marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and other moist habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet environments, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often found in areas with fluctuating water levels.</p>
