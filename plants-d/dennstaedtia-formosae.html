                    <h1>Dennstaedtia formosae</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia formosae, commonly known as the Taiwan shield fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Dennstaedtia formosae make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
