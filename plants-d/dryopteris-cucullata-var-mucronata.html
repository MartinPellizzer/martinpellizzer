                    <h1>Dryopteris cucullata var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris cucullata var. mucronata, commonly known as the rounded shield fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, broad, and leathery frond with a rounded shape and a short, blunt apex. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, brownish layer of roots, which help anchor it to the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild.</p>
