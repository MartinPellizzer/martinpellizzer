<p>Diasperus arvensis, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal and survival in various soil types.</p>
