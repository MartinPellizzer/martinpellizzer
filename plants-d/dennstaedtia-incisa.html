<p>Dennstaedtia incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
