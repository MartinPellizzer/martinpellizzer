<p>Dendrobium huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a unique growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Dendrobium huttonii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
