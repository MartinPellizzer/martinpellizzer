<p>Dryopteris macaronesica, commonly known as the Macaronesian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and Cape Verde.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
