<p>Dryopteris struthiopteroides, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is known for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
