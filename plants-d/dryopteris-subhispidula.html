                    <h1>Dryopteris subhispidula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subhispidula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
