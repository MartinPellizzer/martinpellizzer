<p>Dryopteris gushaingensis, commonly known as the Gushaingensis wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
