                    <h1>Deschampsia antarctica</h1>
<p>Deschampsia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is one of the few flowering plants that thrive in the extreme conditions of Antarctica, where it grows on rocky soils and in coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers. It is adapted to withstand strong winds, low temperatures, and limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the resilience of plant life in some of the harshest environments on Earth.</p>
