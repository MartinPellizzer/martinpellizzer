                    <h1>Diplotropis racemosa var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Diplotropis racemosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
