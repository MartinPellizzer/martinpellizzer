<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into the familiar orange to reddish fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, honey-like flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in traditional recipes.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species.</p>
