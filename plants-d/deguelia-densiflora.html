<p>Deguelia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered deguelia, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which help it to climb and support itself among the forest canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Deguelia densiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
