                    <h1>Dryopteris sasakii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sasakii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts are underway to protect its natural habitats.</p>
