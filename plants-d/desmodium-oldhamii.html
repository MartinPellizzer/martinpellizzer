<p>Desmodium oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's burr, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
