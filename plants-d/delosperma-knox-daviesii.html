<p>Delosperma knox-daviesii, commonly known as the Knox-Davies ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is an excellent choice for xeriscaping in arid climates.</p>
