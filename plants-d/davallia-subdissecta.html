<p>Davallia subdissecta, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with new growth emerging from the base each year.</p>
