<p>Duosperma nudantherum, commonly known as the naked anther lichen, is a unique lichen species that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are often found in distinct patches on the thallus.</p>
<p>This lichen is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
