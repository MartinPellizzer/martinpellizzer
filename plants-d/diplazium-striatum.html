                    <h1>Diplazium striatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium striatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawksbeard, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, producing a dense clump of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
