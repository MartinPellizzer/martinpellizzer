                    <h1>Decalepidanthus trollii</h1>
<p>Decalepidanthus trollii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones instead of flowers. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but rare species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
