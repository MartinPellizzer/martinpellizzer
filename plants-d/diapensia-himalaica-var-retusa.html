                    <h1>Diapensia himalaica var. retusa</h1>
<p>Diapensia himalaica var. retusa, commonly known as the Himalayan diapensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and flowering plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated, slightly curled leaf tips, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
