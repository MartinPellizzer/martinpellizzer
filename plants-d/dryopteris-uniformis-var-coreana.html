                    <h1>Dryopteris uniformis var. coreana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris uniformis var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a variant of the uniform shield fern native to Korea and parts of northeastern China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features fronds that are broadly ovate with a distinctive shield-shaped base, and it produces sori along the margins of the fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green appearance.</p>
