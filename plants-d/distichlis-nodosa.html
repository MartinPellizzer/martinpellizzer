                    <h1>Distichlis nodosa</h1>
<p>Distichlis nodosa, commonly known as saltbush or sea grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand harsh environmental conditions makes it ecologically significant in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
