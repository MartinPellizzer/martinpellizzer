                    <h1>Dactyloctenium scindicum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium scindicum, commonly known as the prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Dactyloctenium scindicum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
