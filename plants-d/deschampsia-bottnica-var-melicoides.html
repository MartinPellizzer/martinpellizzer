                    <h1>Deschampsia bottnica var. melicoides</h1>
<p>Deschampsia bottnica var. melicoides, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in extreme climates.</p>
