                    <h1>Dryopteris subspinosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subspinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often branched fronds that are covered with small, spinulose (spiny) scales, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
