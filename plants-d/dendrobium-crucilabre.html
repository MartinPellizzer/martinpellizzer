                    <h1>Dendrobium crucilabre</h1>
<p>Dendrobium crucilabre, commonly known as the crucifix orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive cruciform shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium crucilabre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
