                    <h1>Dryopteris calcarata var. sericea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris calcarata var. sericea, commonly known as the silky cliff fern, is a variant of the rockcap fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a silky, silver-white layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist crevices. Its fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is an important component of the local flora in its habitat.</p>
