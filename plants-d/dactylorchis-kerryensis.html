                    <h1>Dactylorchis kerryensis</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
