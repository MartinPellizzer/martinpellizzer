                    <h1>Dryopteris sarawakensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
