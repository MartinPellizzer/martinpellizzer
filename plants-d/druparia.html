                    <h1>Druparia</h1>
<p>Druparia, commonly known as the drupe family, is a botanical group that includes a variety of plants producing fruits called drupes.</p>
<p>These drupes are characterized by a fleshy outer layer, a thin pit-like mesocarp, and a hard inner endocarp that encloses the seed. Members of the druparia family are found in various habitats around the world, including temperate and tropical regions. Examples of plants in this family include peaches, cherries, and almonds.</p>
<p>The structure of the drupe is an adaptation that aids in seed dispersal through animals that consume the fruit.</p>
