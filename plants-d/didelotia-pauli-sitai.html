                    <h1>Didelotia pauli-sitai</h1>
<p>Didelotia pauli-sitai, commonly known as the Sitai ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, often in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
