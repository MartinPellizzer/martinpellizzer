                    <h1>Dysoxylum octandrum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum octandrum, commonly known as the eight-angled satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, heavy wood, it is valued for furniture and musical instruments, though it is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
