                    <h1>Dendrochilum clowesiae</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum clowesiae, commonly known as the Clowes' tree orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
