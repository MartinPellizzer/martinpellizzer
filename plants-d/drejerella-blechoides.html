<p>Drejerella blechoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Drejerella blechoides is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
