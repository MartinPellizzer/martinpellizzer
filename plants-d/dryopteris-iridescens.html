                    <h1>Dryopteris iridescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris iridescens, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that have a distinctive iridescent sheen when exposed to light. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
