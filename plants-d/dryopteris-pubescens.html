                    <h1>Dryopteris pubescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, short hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
