<p>Draba chrysantha var. crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, thick, and leathery leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust and fleshy leaves compared to the typical form of Draba chrysantha.</p>
