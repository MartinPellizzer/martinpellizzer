<p>Dendrobium angustispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, appearing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
