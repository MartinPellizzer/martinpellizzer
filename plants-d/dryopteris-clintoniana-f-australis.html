                    <h1>Dryopteris clintoniana f. australis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris clintoniana f. australis, commonly known as the southern cliff brake, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils, often on cliffs or in shaded woodland areas. Its fronds are usually shorter and more robust compared to the typical form of D. clintoniana.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
