<p>Dugandiodendron chimantense, commonly known as the Chimant√© Forest Tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
