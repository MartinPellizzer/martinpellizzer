                    <h1>Dryopteris paleolata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris paleolata, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris paleolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
