                    <h1>Dendrobium bigibbum var. compactum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium bigibbum var. compactum, commonly known as the mini phalaenopsis, is a compact orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features short, thick pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
