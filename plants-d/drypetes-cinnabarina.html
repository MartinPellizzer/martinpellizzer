<p>Drypetes cinnabarina, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, reddish wood, which has been historically used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions.</p>
