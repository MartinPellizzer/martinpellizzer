<p>Draba hirta subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rock mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of hairy, linear leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates.</p>
