<p>Diphasiastrum yueshanense, commonly known as Yueshan clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species of the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its closely spirally arranged, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices and forest floors. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
