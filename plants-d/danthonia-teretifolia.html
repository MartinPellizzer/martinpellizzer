<p>Danthonia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support native wildlife.</p>
