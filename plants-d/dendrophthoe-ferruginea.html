                    <h1>Dendrophthoe ferruginea</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
