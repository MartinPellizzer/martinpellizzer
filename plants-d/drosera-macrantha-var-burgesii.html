                    <h1>Drosera macrantha var. burgesii</h1>
<p>Drosera macrantha var. burgesii, commonly known as Burges' Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant produces tall, erect stems with elongated leaves that form a rosette shape. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are borne on long, slender stalks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet, boggy environments and its unique method of nutrient acquisition.</p>
