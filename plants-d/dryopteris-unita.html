                    <h1>Dryopteris unita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris unita, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are usually curled into a fiddlehead shape in the spring.</p>
