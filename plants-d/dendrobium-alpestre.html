                    <h1>Dendrobium alpestre</h1>
<p>Dendrobium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, adapting to its high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Dendrobium alpestre is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience.</p>
