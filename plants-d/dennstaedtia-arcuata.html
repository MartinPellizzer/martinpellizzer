<p>Dennstaedtia arcuata, commonly known as the curl fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that curl upward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with slender, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
