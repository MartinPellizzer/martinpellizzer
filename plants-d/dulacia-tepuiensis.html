<p>Dulacia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui dulacia, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to the high-altitude, rocky environments of the tepuis, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Dulacia tepuiensis is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution.</p>
