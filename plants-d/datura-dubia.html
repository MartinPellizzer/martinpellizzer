<p>Datura dubia, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening at night. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potentially dangerous species to handle. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Datura dubia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources.</p>
