                    <h1>Dryopetalon stenocarpum</h1>
<p>Dryopetalon stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a short-lived, ephemeral growth cycle, often appearing after heavy rainfall. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, humus-laden soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanism make it an important component of its ecological niche.</p>
