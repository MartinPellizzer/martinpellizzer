                    <h1>Deschampsia minor</h1>
<p>Deschampsia minor, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Deschampsia minor is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
