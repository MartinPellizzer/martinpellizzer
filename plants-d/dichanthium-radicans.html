                    <h1>Dichanthium radicans</h1>
<p>Dichanthium radicans, commonly known as the creeping fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Dichanthium radicans is often found in open habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and disturbed agricultural areas.</p>
