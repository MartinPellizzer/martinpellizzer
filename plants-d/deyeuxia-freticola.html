<p>Deyeuxia freticola, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
