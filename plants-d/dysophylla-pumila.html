                    <h1>Dysophylla pumila</h1>
<p>Dysophylla pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often reduced, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic structures.</p>
<p>Dysophylla pumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both predation and photosynthesis.</p>
