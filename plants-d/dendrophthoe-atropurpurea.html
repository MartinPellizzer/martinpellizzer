                    <h1>Dendrophthoe atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually small, scale-like, and often clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe atropurpurea plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
