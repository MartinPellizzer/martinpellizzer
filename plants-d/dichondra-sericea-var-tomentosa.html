                    <h1>Dichondra sericea var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Dichondra sericea var. tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing perennial ground cover plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of short, woolly hairs, giving the plant its "tomentosa" designation. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
