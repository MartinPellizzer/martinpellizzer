<p>Doryopteris feei f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the Doryopteris feei species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This fern is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in its genus. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night due to the presence of specialized chloroplasts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of organic matter in the soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
