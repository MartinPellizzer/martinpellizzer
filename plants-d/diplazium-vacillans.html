                    <h1>Diplazium vacillans</h1>
<p>Diplazium vacillans, commonly known as the wavy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, shield-like structures along their margins. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
