<p>Dicksonia rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Its spores are released from the sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicksonia rhombifolia is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
