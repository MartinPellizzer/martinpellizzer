<p>Draconia, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown of spiky, dark green leaves.

Its adaptations to arid environments include a thick trunk for water storage and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Draconia make it a fascinating subject for both scientific study and ecological conservation.</p>
