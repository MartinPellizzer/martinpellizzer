<p>Dorstenia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dorstenia gypsophila is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
