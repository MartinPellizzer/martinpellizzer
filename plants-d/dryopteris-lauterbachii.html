                    <h1>Dryopteris lauterbachii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium.</p>
