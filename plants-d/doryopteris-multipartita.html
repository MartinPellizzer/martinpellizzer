<p>Doryopteris multipartita, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
