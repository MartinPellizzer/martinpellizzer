<p>Dryopteris chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which are adorned with fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and unfurling throughout the growing season.</p>
