                    <h1>Dendrophthora amalfiensis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora amalfiensis, commonly known as the Amalfi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and pines, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
