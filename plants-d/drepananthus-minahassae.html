<p>Drepananthus minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
