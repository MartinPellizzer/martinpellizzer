                    <h1>Drosanthemum</h1>
<p>Drosanthemum, commonly known as the "butterfly flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that resemble butterflies. Drosanthemum species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Their flowers are often short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Drosanthemum coccineum, which is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
