                    <h1>Deschampsia media var. masclansii</h1>
<p>Deschampsia media var. masclansii, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural setting.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar ecological requirements.</p>
