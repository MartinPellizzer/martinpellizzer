<p>Drosera intricata, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color.</p>
<p>Drosera intricata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
