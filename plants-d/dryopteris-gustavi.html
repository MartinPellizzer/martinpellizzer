<p>Dryopteris gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris gustavi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
