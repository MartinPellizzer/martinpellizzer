                    <h1>Dryopteris oligodonta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oligodonta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
