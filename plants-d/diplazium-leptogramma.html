                    <h1>Diplazium leptogramma</h1>
<p>Diplazium leptogramma, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread across aquatic substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland ecosystems.</p>
