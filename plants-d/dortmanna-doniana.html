<p>Dortmanna doniana, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, wheel-like inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Dortmanna doniana plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
