                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of silvery-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with eight petals, typical of the Dryas genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
