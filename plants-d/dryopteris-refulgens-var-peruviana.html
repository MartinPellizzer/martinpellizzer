                    <h1>Dryopteris refulgens var. peruviana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris refulgens var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wood fern, is a variant of the shining wood fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, graceful fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, glossy appearance that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in woodland gardens where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
