<p>Diplazium longicarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often clustered fronds. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium longicarpum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
