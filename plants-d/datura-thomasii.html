<p>Datura thomasii, commonly known as desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruit that contains toxic seeds, which are used by some animals as a food source. Datura thomasii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes tropane alkaloids, which contribute to its toxic properties and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
