                    <h1>Dryopteris acuminata var. cristata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris acuminata var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a unique, undulating appearance due to the presence of a central ridge and lateral lobes. It produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are protected by indusia.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage.</p>
