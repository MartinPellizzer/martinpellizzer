                    <h1>Deyeuxia eminens f. brevipila</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia eminens f. brevipila, commonly known as the short-branched tussock grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense tussocks, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of many grass species. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the vegetation structure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
