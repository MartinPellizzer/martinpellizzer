                    <h1>Didymocarpus depressus</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus depressus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with thick, succulent stems that store water, aiding its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy, oval-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Didymocarpus depressus is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a characteristic species of desert ecosystems.</p>
