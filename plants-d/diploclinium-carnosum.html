<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
