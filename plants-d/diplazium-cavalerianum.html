<p>Diplazium cavalerianum, commonly known as the Cavalerian's spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
