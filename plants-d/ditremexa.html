                    <h1>Ditremexa</h1>
<p>Ditremexa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and specialized habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status and limited natural range.</p>
