                    <h1>Diplachne carinata</h1>
<p>Diplachne carinata, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne carinata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a significant weed in many regions.</p>
