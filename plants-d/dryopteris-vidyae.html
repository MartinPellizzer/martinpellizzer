                    <h1>Dryopteris vidyae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris vidyae, commonly known as the Vidyasagar water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
