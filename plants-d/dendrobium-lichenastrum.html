<p>Dendrobium lichenastrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
