                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. didymosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. didymosora, commonly known as the twin-veined wood fern, is a variant of the parasitic wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, and its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant exhibits a unique parasitic relationship, relying on the roots of other plants for nutrients, though it does not harm its host.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in spherical, fertile fronds that develop from the base of the plant, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
