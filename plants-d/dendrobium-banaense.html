<p>Dendrobium banaense, commonly known as the Banaen orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color.</p>
<p>Dendrobium banaense thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
