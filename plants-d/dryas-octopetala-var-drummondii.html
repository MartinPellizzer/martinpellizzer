                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. drummondii</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
