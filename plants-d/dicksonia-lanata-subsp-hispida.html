<p>Dicksonia lanata subsp.</p>
<p>hispida, commonly known as the hispid tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, pinnate fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, hairy texture, which gives the plant its subspecific name "hispida.". This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
