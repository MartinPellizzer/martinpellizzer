                    <h1>Dryopteris antarctica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it survive in harsh, frost-prone environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in cool temperate gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
