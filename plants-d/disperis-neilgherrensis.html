                    <h1>Disperis neilgherrensis</h1>
<p>Disperis neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Neilgherry Disperis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its showy inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
