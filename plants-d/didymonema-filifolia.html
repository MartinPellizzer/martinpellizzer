<p>Didymonema filifolia, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a soft, velvety upper surface and a more rugged, granular lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
