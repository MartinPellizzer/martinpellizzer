<p>Dendrobium sirophyton, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sirophyton is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
