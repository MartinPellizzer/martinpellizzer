                    <h1>Drosera × bockowskii</h1>
<p>Drosera × bockowskii, commonly known as the Bockowski's sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant that exhibits traits from its parent species, Drosera binata and Drosera intermedia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and carnivorous behavior.</p>
