                    <h1>Durandea</h1>
<p>Durandea, commonly known as the African orchid or red orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of true orchids. Durandea species typically have slender stems and are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in local ecosystems.</p>
