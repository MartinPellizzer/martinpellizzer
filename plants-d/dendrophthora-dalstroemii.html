                    <h1>Dendrophthora dalstroemii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora dalstroemii, commonly known as the giant panda mushroom, is a basidiomycete fungus found primarily in the temperate forests of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped cap that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The cap is usually pale yellow to ochre in color, with a distinct, velvety texture and a central bump. The stem is thick, often with a bulbous base, and is typically lighter in color than the cap.</p>
<p>This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing an important role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
