<p>Dendrobium palustre, commonly known as the marsh dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, and they bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Dendrobium palustre thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
