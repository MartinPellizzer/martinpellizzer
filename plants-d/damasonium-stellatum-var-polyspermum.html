<p>Damasonium stellatum var. polyspermum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a rosette structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its increased seed production compared to the typical species, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
