                    <h1>Dryopteris schultzei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its elegant, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
