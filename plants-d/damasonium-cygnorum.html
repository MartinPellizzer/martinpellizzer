<p>Damasonium cygnorum, commonly known as the water forget-me-not, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually oval or elliptical in shape.</p>
<p>Damasonium cygnorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its oxygenating effects.</p>
