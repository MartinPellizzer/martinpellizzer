                    <h1>Dicranopteris cryptocarpa</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris cryptocarpa, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often submerged in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its spores are released in the form of small, dark brown sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris cryptocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
