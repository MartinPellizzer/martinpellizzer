                    <h1>Diemisa rosea</h1>
<p>Diemisa rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Diemisa rosea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
