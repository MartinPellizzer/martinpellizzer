                    <h1>Draco kirkii</h1>
<p>Draco kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Draco kirkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries.</p>
