                            <h1>Duggena Mollis</h1>
<p>Mollis duggena, scientifically known as Duggena mollis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of great botanical interest. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and striking violet flowers that bloom during the short summer months. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Duggena mollis faces significant threats to its survival. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this delicate species and preserve its ecological role.</p>
