<p>Drosera stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sundew, is a low-growing carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems that produce numerous small, sticky tentacles covered in glandular hairs.</p>
<p>These hairs secrete a mucilage that traps and digests small insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
