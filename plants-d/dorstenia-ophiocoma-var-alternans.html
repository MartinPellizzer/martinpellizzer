<p>Dorstenia ophiocoma var. alternans, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a unique member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, colorful flowers. Its leaves are typically spiral-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variation of Dorstenia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens.</p>
