                    <h1>Daucus fontanesii</h1>
<p>Daucus fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as economically valuable as those of cultivated carrots.</p>
<p>Daucus fontanesii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
