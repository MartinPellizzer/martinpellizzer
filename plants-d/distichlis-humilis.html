                    <h1>Distichlis humilis</h1>
<p>Distichlis humilis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps bind soil, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal habitats.</p>
