<p>Descurainia stricta var. minutiflora, commonly known as dwarf wall rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
