<p>Drosera anglica f. pusilla, commonly known as the small English sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing species with sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap insect prey. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils, such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually less than 5 cm in length, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across the UK.</p>
