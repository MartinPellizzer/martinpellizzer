<p>Diplotaxis virgata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy golden burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, spiny seed pods that mature in the dry season. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
