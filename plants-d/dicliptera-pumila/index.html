<p>Pumila dicliptera, scientifically known as Dicliptera pumila, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is commonly found in moist, lowland areas. This plant is notable for its dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its resilience and adaptability make it a subject of interest for botanists and environmental scientists.</p>
