                    <h1>Dalea annua</h1>
<p>Dalea annua, commonly known as annual prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Dalea annua is an annual plant, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season, and it is often found in native plant restoration projects.</p>
