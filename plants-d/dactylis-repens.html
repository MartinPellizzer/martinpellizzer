                    <h1>Dactylis repens</h1>
<p>Dactylis repens, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Dactylis repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been traditionally used in floral arrangements and as a source of fiber.</p>
