                    <h1>Dischidia</h1>
<p>Dischidia, commonly known as the air plant or rat's tail vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Dischidia species are characterized by their unique, often fleshy leaves that can store water, making them well adapted to humid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
