The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, preferring cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its cold hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with a sheltered location to protect it from harsh winter winds.</p>
