                    <h1>Dryades</h1>
<p>Dryades, commonly known as dryads, are mythological forest nymphs associated with trees, but the term can also refer to certain types of plants.</p>
<p>In botanical terms, the name is sometimes used to describe species of plants that have a strong connection to woodland environments. These plants often thrive in shaded, moist conditions typical of forest floors. They may include various ferns, mosses, and flowering plants adapted to low light.</p>
<p>Their presence is indicative of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem.</p>
