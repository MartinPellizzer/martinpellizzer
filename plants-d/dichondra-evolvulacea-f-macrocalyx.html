                    <h1>Dichondra evolvulacea f. macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Dichondra evolvulacea f. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered dichondra, is a variant of the species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and the subtle floral display, though it is less commonly cultivated than other dichondra species.</p>
