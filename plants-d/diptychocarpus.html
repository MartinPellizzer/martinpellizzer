                    <h1>Diptychocarpus</h1>
<p>Diptychocarpus, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Diptychocarpus species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season to conserve water.</p>
<p>The fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
