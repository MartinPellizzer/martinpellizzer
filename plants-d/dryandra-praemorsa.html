                    <h1>Dryandra praemorsa</h1>
<p>Dryandra praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, skull-like flower structure, which gives it its ominous common name. The plant produces a single, large, pale yellow or greenish-white flower with a distinctive blackened center. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
