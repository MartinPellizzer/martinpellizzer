<p>Dendrobenthamia tonkinensis var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed tonkin orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a short inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
