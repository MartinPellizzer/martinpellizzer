                    <h1>Dendrobium oxyanthum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium oxyanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its often-dry habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium oxyanthum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both horticultural and traditional medicinal purposes.</p>
