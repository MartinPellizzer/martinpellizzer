                    <h1>Diasperus vacciniifolius</h1>
<p>Diasperus vacciniifolius, commonly known as the red-stemmed rockrose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Diasperus vacciniifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
