<p>Didissandra violacea, commonly known as the violet sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, woody shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a faintly aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Didissandra violacea is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
