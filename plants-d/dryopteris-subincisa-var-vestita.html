<p>Dryopteris subincisa var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its fronds are typically a deep green, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
