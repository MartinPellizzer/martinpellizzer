                    <h1>Dudleya parva</h1>
<p>Dudleya parva, commonly known as the dwarf dudleya, is a small, succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
