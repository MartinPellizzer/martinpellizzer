                    <h1>Dryopteris rivularioides var. umbratica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rivularioides var. umbratica, commonly known as the shady wood fern, is a variant of the river fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, wedge-shaped pinnae that give the plant a finely textured appearance. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
