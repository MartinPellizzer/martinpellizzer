<p>Daucus pumilus subsp.</p>
<p>maritimus, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a cylindrical, ridged structure that resembles a tiny carrot, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to maritime environments.</p>
