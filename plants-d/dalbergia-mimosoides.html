                    <h1>Dalbergia mimosoides</h1>
<p>Dalbergia mimosoides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosa plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in the furniture and musical instrument industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
