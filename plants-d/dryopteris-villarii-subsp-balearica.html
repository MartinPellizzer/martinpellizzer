<p>Dryopteris villarii subsp.</p>
<p>balearica, commonly known as the Balearic wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a pale green hue.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
