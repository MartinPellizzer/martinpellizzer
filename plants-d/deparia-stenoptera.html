                    <h1>Deparia stenoptera</h1>
<p>Deparia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's intricate leaf structure and adaptability to humid conditions make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
