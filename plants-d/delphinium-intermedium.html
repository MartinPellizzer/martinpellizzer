                    <h1>Delphinium intermedium</h1>
<p>Delphinium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with prominent spurred petals, which are typical of the delphinium genus. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Delphinium intermedium is often found in meadows and open woods at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
