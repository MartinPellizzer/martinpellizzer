<p>Dryopteris remota, commonly known as the remote wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into narrow segments with a feathery appearance, and they are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.

<p>Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
