<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Diplazium curtisii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
