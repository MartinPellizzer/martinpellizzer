                    <h1>Darea pectinata</h1>
<p>Darea pectinata, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, waxy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Darea pectinata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
