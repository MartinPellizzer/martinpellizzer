                    <h1>Dalbergia obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Dalbergia obtusifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
