<p>Dryopteris wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its alpine habitat.</p>
