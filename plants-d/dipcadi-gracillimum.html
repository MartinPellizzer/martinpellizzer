                    <h1>Dipcadi gracillimum</h1>
<p>Dipcadi gracillimum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
