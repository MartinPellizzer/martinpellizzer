<p>Dendrobium cymbiforme, commonly known as the orchid of the hills, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, drooping inflorescences with numerous fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cymbiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
