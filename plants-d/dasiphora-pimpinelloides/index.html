                            <h1>Dasiphora Pimpinelloides</h1>
<p>Dasiphora pimpinelloides is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its common name, "goat's beard," refers to the fuzzy, beard-like appearance of its seed heads. Despite its rugged habitat, Dasiphora pimpinelloides is a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
