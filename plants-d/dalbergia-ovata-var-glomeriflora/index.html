                            <h1>Dalbergia Ovata Var. Glomeriflora</h1>
<p>African rosewood, scientifically known as Dalbergia ovata var. glomeriflora, is a rare and highly valued tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is prized for its dense, dark wood that is both durable and aesthetically appealing. The species has been heavily harvested, leading to significant declines in its natural populations. Due to its unique properties, it is often used in the crafting of musical instruments and fine furniture. Conservation efforts are now critical to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
