                    <h1>Dendrophthora densifrons</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora densifrons, commonly known as the dense-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality.</p>
