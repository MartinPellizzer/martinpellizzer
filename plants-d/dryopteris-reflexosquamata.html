<p>Dryopteris reflexosquamata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
