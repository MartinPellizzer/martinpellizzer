                    <h1>Dipteris wallichii</h1>
<p>Dipteris wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds that are often shield-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Dipteris wallichii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
