<p>Digitaria marginata var. pruriens, commonly known as itchgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species.
