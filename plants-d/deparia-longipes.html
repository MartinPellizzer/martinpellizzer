<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
