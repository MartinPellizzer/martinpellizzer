                            <h1>Diplacus Viscidus</h1>
<p>Diplacus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a striking member of the mallow family native to the western United States. This perennial plant is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers and thick, sticky leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in rocky slopes and dry meadows, often found in regions with Mediterranean climates. Despite its beauty, it is threatened by habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
