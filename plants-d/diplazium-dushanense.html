<p>Diplazium dushanense, commonly known as the Dushanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Diplazium dushanense is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
