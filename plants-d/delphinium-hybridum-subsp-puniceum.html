<p>Delphinium hybridum subsp.</p>
<p>puniceum, commonly known as the red larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of vibrant red or pink flowers, which are typically spurred at the base.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.</p>
