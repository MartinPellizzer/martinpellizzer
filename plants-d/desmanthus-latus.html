<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine.</p>
