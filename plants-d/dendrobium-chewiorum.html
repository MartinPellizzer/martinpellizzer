                    <h1>Dendrobium chewiorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium chewiorum, commonly known as the Ceylon orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Sri Lanka and India.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium chewiorum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
