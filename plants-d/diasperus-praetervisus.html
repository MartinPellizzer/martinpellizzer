                    <h1>Diasperus praetervisus</h1>
<p>Diasperus praetervisus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two parts when mature, a feature common in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Diasperus praetervisus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability.</p>
