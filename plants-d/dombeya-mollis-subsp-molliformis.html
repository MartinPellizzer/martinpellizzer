<p>Dombeya mollis subsp.</p>
<p>molliformis, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies molliformis is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Dombeya species.</p>
