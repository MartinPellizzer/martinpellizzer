                    <h1>Dryas longifolia</h1>
<p>Dryas longifolia, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cup-like structure. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete substances to deter herbivores and prevent desiccation.</p>
<p>Dryas longifolia is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats.</p>
