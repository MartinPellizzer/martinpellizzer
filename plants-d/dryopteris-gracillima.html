                    <h1>Dryopteris gracillima</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gracillima, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sori.</p>
