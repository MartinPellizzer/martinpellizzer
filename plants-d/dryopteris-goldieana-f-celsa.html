<p>Dryopteris goldieana f. celsa, commonly known as the Celsa Shield Fern, is a variant of the Goldie's Shield Fern.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern that features leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape.

<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
