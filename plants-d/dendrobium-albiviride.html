<p>Dendrobium albiviride, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in dense, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white with greenish veins, and it produces small, greenish-yellow blossoms.</p>
<p>Dendrobium albiviride is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
