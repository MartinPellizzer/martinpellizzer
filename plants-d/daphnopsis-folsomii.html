<p>Daphnopsis folsomii, commonly known as the Folsom's daphnopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage, which features small, glossy leaves arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native environment.</p>
