                    <h1>Dryopteris subsageniacea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subsageniacea, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, dense growth habit with leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
