<p>Dryas incisa var. cana, commonly known as the white mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
