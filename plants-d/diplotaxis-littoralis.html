<p>Diplotaxis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal diplotaxis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Diplotaxis littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
