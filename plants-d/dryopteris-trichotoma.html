<p>Dryopteris trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy woodfern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are covered in short, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Dryopteris trichotoma plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
