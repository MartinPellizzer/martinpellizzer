<p>Dammara rumphii, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize shorelines and filter sediments. The plant has smooth, dark bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dammara rumphii plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
