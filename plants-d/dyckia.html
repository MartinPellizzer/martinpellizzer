                    <h1>Dyckia</h1>
<p>Dyckia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of plants in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their distinctive rosette-shaped foliage. The leaves are typically sword-like, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Dyckia species often produce striking inflorescences with showy flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
