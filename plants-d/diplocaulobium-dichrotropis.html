                    <h1>Diplocaulobium dichrotropis</h1>
<p>Diplocaulobium dichrotropis, commonly known as the two-colored water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's unique leaf structure and flowering habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
