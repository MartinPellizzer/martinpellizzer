                    <h1>Dendrobium tetragonum var. variabile</h1>
<p>Dendrobium tetragonum var. variabile, commonly known as the Variable Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features clustered, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, blooming in summer.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive.</p>
