<p>Dryoathyrium uniturcatum, commonly known as the goldenstar moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are often curved and covered with a thick layer of silica, which helps protect it from desiccation. It produces spores in capsules that are clustered in dense, terminal cushions, a feature common among many mosses.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
