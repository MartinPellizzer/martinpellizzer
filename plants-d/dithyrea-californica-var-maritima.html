                    <h1>Dithyrea californica var. maritima</h1>
<p>Dithyrea californica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal dithyrea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. This variant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of coastal ecosystem health.</p>
