                    <h1>Dendrophthora geniculata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora geniculata, commonly known as the spiralwood, is a rare and unusual plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral growth pattern, where the stems twist around their own axis in a helical manner. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of elongated, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, Dendrophthora geniculata is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
