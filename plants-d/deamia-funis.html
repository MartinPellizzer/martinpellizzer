<p>Deamia funis, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supporting structures in a spiral manner. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are elongated pods that split open to release seeds. Deamia funis has fibrous roots that help in stabilizing the plant as it climbs, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>It is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests.</p>
