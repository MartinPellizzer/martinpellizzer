<p>Digitaria sacculata, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, and its seeds are small, smooth, and typically dispersed by wind. Digitaria sacculata is adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate a wide range of soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
