                    <h1>Diplazium balliviani</h1>
<p>Diplazium balliviani, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, needle-like pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
