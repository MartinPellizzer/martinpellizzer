<p>Deschampsia curtifolia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Deschampsia curtifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
