<p>Disporopsis shaolinchiensis, commonly known as the Shaolin cliff fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
