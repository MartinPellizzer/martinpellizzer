                    <h1>Dioon mejiae</h1>
<p>Dioon mejiae, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and a stout, unbranched trunk that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Dioon mejiae is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
