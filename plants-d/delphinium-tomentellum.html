                    <h1>Delphinium tomentellum</h1>
<p>Delphinium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids.</p>
