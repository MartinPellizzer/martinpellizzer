                    <h1>Diphylax</h1>
<p>Diphylax, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants typically have basal leaves that are either lobed or entire, with some species exhibiting a rosette growth habit. The flowers are usually yellow, with ray florets that resemble those of true dandelions.</p>
<p>Diphylax species are often found in grasslands and open habitats, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
