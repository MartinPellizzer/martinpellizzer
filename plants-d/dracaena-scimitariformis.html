<p>Dracaena scimitariformis, commonly known as the sword leaf dracaena, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
