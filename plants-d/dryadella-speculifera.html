                    <h1>Dryadella speculifera</h1>
<p>Dryadella speculifera, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a thin, leathery crust on tree bark, rocks, and soil, often appearing as a silvery-gray or pale greenish layer. The plant's structure consists of a fungal matrix interspersed with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is particularly sensitive to air pollution, making it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is rarely found in urban areas but is common in undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
