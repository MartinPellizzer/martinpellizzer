<p>Dryopteris archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
