                    <h1>Didymopanax leco</h1>
<p>Didymopanax leco, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically compound. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
