                    <h1>Dactylis capitellata</h1>
<p>Dactylis capitellata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, pea-like flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is well adapted to grow in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Dactylis capitellata is often found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
