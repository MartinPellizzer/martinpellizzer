The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
