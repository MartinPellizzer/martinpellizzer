                    <h1>Desmotrichum parietiforme</h1>
<p>Desmotrichum parietiforme, commonly known as the rock-dwelling moss, is a species of moss that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown appearance, with small, leaf-like structures that are tightly packed. It lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a structure composed of specialized cells for water absorption and retention.</p>
<p>This moss is often found on cliffs, walls, and other rocky substrates, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
