<p>Davidia involucrata var. vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a rare and ornamental species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like flowers that appear in late spring, which are surrounded by a pale green involucrum. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature typical of many members of the Aceraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unique floral display and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
