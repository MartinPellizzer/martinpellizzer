<p>Diploblechnum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of ferns native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a silvery sheen due to the presence of trichomes. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex structure that includes a central rachis and multiple pinnae. These ferns thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
