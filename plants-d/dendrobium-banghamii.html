                    <h1>Dendrobium banghamii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium banghamii, commonly known as the Bangham's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cylindrical pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
