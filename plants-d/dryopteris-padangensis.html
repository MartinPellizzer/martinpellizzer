<p>Dryopteris padangensis, commonly known as the Padang shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
