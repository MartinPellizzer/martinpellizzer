                    <h1>Diplocaulobium recurvifolium</h1>
<p>Diplocaulobium recurvifolium, commonly known as the recurved leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, recurved leaves that give it a unique, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its fronds are usually light green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
