<p>Delosperma testaceum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
