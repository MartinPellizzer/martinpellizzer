                    <h1>Dysoxylum paniculatum</h1>
<p>Dysoxylum paniculatum, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain sticky, fleshy seeds. It thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key species in coastal vegetation and shoreline stabilization.</p>
