<p>Damnacanthus indicus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf devil's backbone, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers with long, slender bracts that resemble a spine, hence its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
