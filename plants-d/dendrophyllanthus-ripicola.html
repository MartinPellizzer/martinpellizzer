                    <h1>Dendrophyllanthus ripicola</h1>
<p>Dendrophyllanthus ripicola, commonly known as the rock fig, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rocky habitats of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on cliffs and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible fruits that are yellow when mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrophyllanthus ripicola is considered an endangered species.</p>
