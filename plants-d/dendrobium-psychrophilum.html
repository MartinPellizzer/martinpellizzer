                    <h1>Dendrobium psychrophilum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium psychrophilum, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
