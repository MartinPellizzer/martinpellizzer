<p>Dryopteris gleichenioides, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
