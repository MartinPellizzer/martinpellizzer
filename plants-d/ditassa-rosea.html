                    <h1>Ditassa rosea</h1>
<p>Ditassa rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
