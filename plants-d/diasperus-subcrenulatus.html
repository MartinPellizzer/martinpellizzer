<p>Diasperus subcrenulatus, commonly known as the smooth-crenulated spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a common feature in the spurge family. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
