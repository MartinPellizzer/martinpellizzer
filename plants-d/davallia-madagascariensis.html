<p>Davallia madagascariensis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form a dense network, contributing to its ability to thrive in compact spaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually leathery and have a unique, almost metallic sheen, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
