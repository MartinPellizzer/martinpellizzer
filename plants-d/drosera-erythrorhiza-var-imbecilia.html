<p>Drosera erythrorhiza var. imbecilia, commonly known as the red-rooted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through insect prey.</p>
