                    <h1>Dopatrium nanum</h1>
<p>Dopatrium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows close to the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage that helps it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water, while its roots are shallow and spread out to maximize water absorption.</p>
<p>Dopatrium nanum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
