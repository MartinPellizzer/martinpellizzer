                    <h1>Dryopteris gilbertii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
