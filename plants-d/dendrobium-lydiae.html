                    <h1>Dendrobium lydiae</h1>
<p>Dendrobium lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features tall, cane-like stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its blooms, which are typically white or pale yellow, appear in late summer and can last for several weeks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dendrobium lydiae is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts.</p>
