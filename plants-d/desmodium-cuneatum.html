                    <h1>Desmodium cuneatum</h1>
<p>Desmodium cuneatum, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value.</p>
<p>Desmodium cuneatum also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
