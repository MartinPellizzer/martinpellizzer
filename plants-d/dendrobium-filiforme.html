                    <h1>Dendrobium filiforme</h1>
<p>Dendrobium filiforme, commonly known as the thread-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it has narrow, linear leaves. It blooms with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
