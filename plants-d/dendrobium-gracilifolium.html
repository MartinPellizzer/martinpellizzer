<p>Dendrobium gracilifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branched stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gracilifolium is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
