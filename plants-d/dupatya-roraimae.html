                    <h1>Dupatya roraimae</h1>
<p>Dupatya roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions, adapting to the unique microclimates of these isolated mountain tops. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters near rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
