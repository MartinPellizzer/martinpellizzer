<p>Drosera ordensis, commonly known as the Ord's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It has a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that form a dense cluster.</p>
<p>Drosera ordensis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an efficient predator in its ecosystem.</p>
