<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or brown, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Derwentia velutina thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments.</p>
