                    <h1>Dissotis paludosa</h1>
<p>Dissotis paludosa, commonly known as the swamp daisies, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil in waterlogged environments. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Dissotis paludosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
