                    <h1>Desmocladus eludens</h1>
<p>Desmocladus eludens, commonly known as the dodder plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and leaves.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants, primarily within the Asteraceae family, using haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique ability to evade detection by its hosts, hence its common name. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions with host plants.</p>
