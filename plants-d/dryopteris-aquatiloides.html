                    <h1>Dryopteris aquatiloides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aquatiloides, commonly known as the water shield fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
