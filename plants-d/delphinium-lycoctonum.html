<p>Delphinium lycoctonum, commonly known as the meadow larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height.

Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes.</p>
