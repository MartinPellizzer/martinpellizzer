                    <h1>Dalea nummularia</h1>
<p>Dalea nummularia, commonly known as silverleaf Dalea, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
