<p>Diplazium wolfii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
