<p>Diplazium stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
