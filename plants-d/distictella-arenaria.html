<p>Distictella arenaria, commonly known as the sand daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Distictella arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh coastal climates.</p>
