<p>Dendrobium greenianum, commonly known as the Greenian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, green, and white. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium greenianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
