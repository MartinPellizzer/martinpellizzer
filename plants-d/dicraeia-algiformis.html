<p>Dicraeia algiformis, commonly known as the algae-like fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes that resemble algae, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to brown fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
