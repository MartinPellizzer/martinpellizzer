                    <h1>Depremesnilia</h1>
<p>Depremesnilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. Native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Depremesnilia is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
