                    <h1>Dendrophthora elliptica var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora elliptica var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed forest fern, is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
