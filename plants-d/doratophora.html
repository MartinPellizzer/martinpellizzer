                    <h1>Doratophora</h1>
<p>Doratophora, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Doratophora species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers play a crucial role in attracting pollinators like beetles and bees, contributing to the plant's reproductive success.</p>
