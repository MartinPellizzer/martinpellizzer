<p>Dioscorea bradei, commonly known as Brade's yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves.
