<p>Deparia albosquamata, commonly known as the white-scaled wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
