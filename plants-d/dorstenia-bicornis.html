<p>Dorstenia bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned dodder, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Dorstenia bicornis is often found growing on other plants, exhibiting a hemiparasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological interactions.</p>
