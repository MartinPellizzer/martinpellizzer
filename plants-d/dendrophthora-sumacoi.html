<p>Dendrophthora sumacoi, commonly known as the sumac leaf gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily associated with sumac species, particularly in the genus Rhus, where it induces the formation of leaf galls. The larvae of this species develop within the galls, feeding on the plant tissue and causing characteristic deformities in the leaves. The plant's response to the insect's feeding results in the formation of compact, swollen growths that provide both protection and nutrition for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>This interaction highlights the complex relationships between plants and their insect herbivores in ecological systems.</p>
