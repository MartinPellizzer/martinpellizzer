<p>Deyeuxia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows and stream banks, and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia himalaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
