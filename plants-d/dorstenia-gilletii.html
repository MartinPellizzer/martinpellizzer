                    <h1>Dorstenia gilletii</h1>
<p>Dorstenia gilletii, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water.</p>
<p>Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dorstenia gilletii is prized for its distinctive appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
