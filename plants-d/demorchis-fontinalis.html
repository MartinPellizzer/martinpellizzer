<p>Demorchis fontinalis, commonly known as the spring moss, is a species of aquatic moss that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, turfy growth habit and its ability to form extensive mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often used as an indicator of water quality in environmental studies.</p>
