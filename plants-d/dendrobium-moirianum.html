                    <h1>Dendrobium moirianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium moirianum, commonly known as the Moir's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrobium moirianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
