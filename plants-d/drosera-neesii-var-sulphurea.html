                    <h1>Drosera neesii var. sulphurea</h1>
<p>Drosera neesii var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually yellowish-green, and the flowers are small, white or greenish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
