                    <h1>Derris malaccensis var. millettioides</h1>
<p>Derris malaccensis var. millettioides, commonly known as the Malayan spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in forest understories rather than in open areas.</p>
