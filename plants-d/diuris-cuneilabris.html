<p>Diuris cuneilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lobed spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its distinctive, spider-like appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in heathlands and open forests, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hairy sepals and petals. It is pollinated by specific insect species, and its blooming period usually occurs in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
