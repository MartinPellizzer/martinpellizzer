                    <h1>Digitaria fusca</h1>
<p>Digitaria fusca, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
