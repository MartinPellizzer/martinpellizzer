                    <h1>Dryopteris microcarpa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
