                    <h1>Dactyladenia pallescens</h1>
<p>Dactyladenia pallescens, commonly known as the pale green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of trees in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
