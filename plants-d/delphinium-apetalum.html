                    <h1>Delphinium apetalum</h1>
<p>Delphinium apetalum, commonly known as the barrenleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves, with only a few basal leaves and no true leaflets on the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
