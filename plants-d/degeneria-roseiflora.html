                    <h1>Degeneria roseiflora</h1>
<p>Degeneria roseiflora, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, velvety pink petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollinator trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate and ephemeral display.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
