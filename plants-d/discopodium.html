<p>Discopodium, commonly known as the "buttercup moss," is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and the presence of distinctive, cup-like structures on its stems. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Discopodium species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms in their ecological niche.</p>
