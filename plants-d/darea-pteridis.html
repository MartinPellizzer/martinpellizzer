                    <h1>Darea pteridis</h1>
<p>Darea pteridis, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Darea pteridis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
