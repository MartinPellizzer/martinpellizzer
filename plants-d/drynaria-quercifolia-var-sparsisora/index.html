                            <h1>Drynaria Quercifolia Var. Sparsisora</h1>
<p>Oak-leaf fern, scientifically known as Drynaria quercifolia var. sparsisora, is a striking evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its unique foliage features large, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. With its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a favored addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
