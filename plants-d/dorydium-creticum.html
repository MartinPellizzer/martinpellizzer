                    <h1>Dorydium creticum</h1>
<p>Dorydium creticum, commonly known as the Cretaceous dorydium, is a rare and ancient plant species with unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive floral structure, which resemble those of early angiosperms. This plant thrives in specific soil conditions, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its morphology suggests a close evolutionary relationship to modern flowering plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
