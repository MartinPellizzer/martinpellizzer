                    <h1>Dendrophthora variabilis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora variabilis, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically alternate and may vary in shape depending on the host species.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora variabilis plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife.</p>
