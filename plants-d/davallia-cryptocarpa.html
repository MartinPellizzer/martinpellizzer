<p>Davallia cryptocarpa, commonly known as the cryptic fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
