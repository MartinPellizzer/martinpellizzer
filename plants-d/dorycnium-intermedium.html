                    <h1>Dorycnium intermedium</h1>
<p>Dorycnium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Dorycnium intermedium is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
