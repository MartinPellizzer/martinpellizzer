<p>Dorstenia ruahensis var. appendiculosa, commonly known as the appendiculate woolly fig, is a unique member of the Moraceae family native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy stems that can grow in a scrambling or climbing manner. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fig-like infructescences that are a key feature of the genus. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unusual appearance and resilience in shaded environments.</p>
