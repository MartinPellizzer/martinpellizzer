<p>Dischidia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped fig or the creeping fig, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped or kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its unique leaf shape and ability to climb or trail make it popular as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Dischidia reniformis is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
