<p>Dolichos erectus, commonly known as the climbing bean or cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems that climb and support its compound leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Dolichos erectus is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and iron levels.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules.</p>
