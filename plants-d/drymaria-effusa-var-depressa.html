                    <h1>Drymaria effusa var. depressa</h1>
<p>Drymaria effusa var. depressa, commonly known as the prostrate drymaria, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with limited moisture.</p>
