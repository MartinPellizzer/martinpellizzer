<p>Dryopteris raddeana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments. It thrives in woodland areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
