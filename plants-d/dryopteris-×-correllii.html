                    <h1>Dryopteris × correllii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × correllii, commonly known as the Correll's wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- to tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
