<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairless, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
