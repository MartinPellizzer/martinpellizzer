                    <h1>Dryopteris polymorpha</h1>
<p>Dryopteris polymorpha, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
