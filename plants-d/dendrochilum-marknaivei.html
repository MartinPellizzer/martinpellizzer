                    <h1>Dendrochilum marknaivei</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum marknaivei, commonly known as the Marknaive's tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
