<p>Dactylorchis fuchsii subsp.</p>
<p>sooana, commonly known as the Sooana orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant has a complex morphology, with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its habitat is often found in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
