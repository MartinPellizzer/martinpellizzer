<p>Dryopteris cambrensis subsp.</p>
<p>cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a perennial fern native to western Europe, particularly Wales and southern England. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
