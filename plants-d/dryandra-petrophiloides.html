<p>Dryandra petrophiloides, commonly known as the granite rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky outcrops and granite formations. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Dryandra petrophiloides is part of the Proteaceae family, which is characterized by its specialized floral structures and adaptations to fire-prone ecosystems.</p>
