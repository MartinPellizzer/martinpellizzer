<p>Dryopteris alloeoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
