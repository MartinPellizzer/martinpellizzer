                    <h1>Decodon salicifolius</h1>
<p>Decodon salicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Decodon salicifolius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
