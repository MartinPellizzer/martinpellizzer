<p>Daphnopsis nevlingiana, commonly known as the Nevlings' daphnopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season, which are followed by small, elliptical berries. Daphnopsis nevlingiana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
