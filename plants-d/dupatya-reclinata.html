<p>Dupatya reclinata, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cascading fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Dupatya reclinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
