                    <h1>Daucus carota var. silvestris</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. silvestris, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its taproot is typically smaller and less showy than that of the cultivated carrot, but it is edible and has a similar flavor.</p>
<p>Wild carrot is often considered a weed but can be a valuable plant for ecological gardens and pollinator habitats.</p>
