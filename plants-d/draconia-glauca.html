                    <h1>Draconia glauca</h1>
<p>Draconia glauca, commonly known as the blue dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem with a bluish-gray hue and produces small, pale green flowers. The plant's leaves are fleshy and arranged in a spiral pattern, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Its most distinctive characteristic is the production of a red, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Draconia glauca thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
