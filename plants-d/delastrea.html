                    <h1>Delastrea</h1>
<p>Delastrea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the family Halimodendraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, branching structure and the presence of calcium carbonate deposits that form a protective layer. Delastrea species are typically found in shallow coastal waters, where they attach to rocky substrates. The algae play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Their calcified structures also contribute to the formation of reef-like formations in certain areas.</p>
