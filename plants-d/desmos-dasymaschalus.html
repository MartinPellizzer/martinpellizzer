The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Desmos dasymaschalus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
