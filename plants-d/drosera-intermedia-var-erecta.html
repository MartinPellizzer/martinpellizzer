                    <h1>Drosera intermedia var. erecta</h1>
<p>Drosera intermedia var. erecta, commonly known as the erect sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the more sprawling form of the typical Drosera intermedia. The plant features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. These hairs are specialized for nutrient absorption, as the plant supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in fens and marshes.</p>
