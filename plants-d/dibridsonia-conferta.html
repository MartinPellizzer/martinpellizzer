                    <h1>Dibridsonia conferta</h1>
<p>Dibridsonia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
