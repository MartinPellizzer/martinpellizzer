<p>Diplazium chittagongense, commonly known as the Chittagong spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Diplazium chittagongense is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar.</p>
