<p>Dodecatheon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Dodecatheon alpinum is an important species for alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions.</p>
