                    <h1>Dryopteris × critica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × critica, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, often with a pale green coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
