                    <h1>Davallia adiantoides</h1>
<p>Davallia adiantoides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is more pronounced in related genera.</p>
