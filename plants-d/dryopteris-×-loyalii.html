                    <h1>Dryopteris × loyalii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × loyalii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
