<p>Delosperma ashtonii, commonly known as the ashtonii ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
