<p>Dendrobium subflavidum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium subflavidum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
