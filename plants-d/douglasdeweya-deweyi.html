<p>Douglasdeweya deweyi, commonly known as Dewey's Douglas fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it has become critically endangered, with only a few known populations remaining.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>
