                    <h1>Digitaria rivae</h1>
<p>Digitaria rivae, commonly known as the river grass or riverset grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies, such as rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Digitaria rivae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
