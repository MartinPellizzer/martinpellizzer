                    <h1>Dendrobium minimiflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium minimiflorum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small-flowered dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its compact size and elegant blooms.</p>
