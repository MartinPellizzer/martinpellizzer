<p>Dichrostachys cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>africana, commonly known as African stranglewood, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
