                    <h1>Derwentia nivea</h1>
<p>Derwentia nivea, commonly known as the white fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that are covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, damp areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, Derwentia nivea is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
