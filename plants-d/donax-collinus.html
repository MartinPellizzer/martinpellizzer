<p>Donax collinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it blooms in early spring.</p>
<p>Donax collinus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
