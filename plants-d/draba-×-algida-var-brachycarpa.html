                    <h1>Draba × algida var. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Draba × algida var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded rockcress, is a hybrid plant species within the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully expand. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its geographic distribution across the European Alps and parts of Central Asia.</p>
