                    <h1>Dactylorhiza latifolia var. pinguis</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza latifolia var. pinguis, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with pale purple to white flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and often grows in association with other moisture-loving plants. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>The variety pinguis is distinguished by its larger, fleshy leaves compared to the typical form of Dactylorhiza latifolia.</p>
