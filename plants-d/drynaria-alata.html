                    <h1>Drynaria alata</h1>
<p>Drynaria alata, commonly known as the creeping brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has long, creeping rhizomes and produces fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into feather-like structures. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Drynaria alata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
