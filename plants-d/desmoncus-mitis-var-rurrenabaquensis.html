<p>Desmoncus mitis var. rurrenabaquensis, commonly known as the Rurrenabaque orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Amazon rainforest of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with high air humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and the threats posed by deforestation, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
