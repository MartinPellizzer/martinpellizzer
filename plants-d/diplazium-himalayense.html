<p>Diplazium himalayense, commonly known as Himalayan water fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds.

Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
