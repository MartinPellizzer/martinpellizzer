                    <h1>Dyckia lagoensis</h1>
<p>Dyckia lagoensis, commonly known as the Lagoense Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
