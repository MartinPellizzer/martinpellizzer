<p>Dipteris horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Dipteris horsfieldii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
