                    <h1>Dryopteris jamesonii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
