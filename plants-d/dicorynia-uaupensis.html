                    <h1>Dicorynia uaupensis</h1>
<p>Dicorynia uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruits are three-valved capsules containing numerous seeds. Dicorynia uaupensis is notable for its historical use in the production of natural rubber, though it is less commonly cultivated today compared to Hevea brasiliensis.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various rainforest species.</p>
