<p>It is characterized by its striking purple fronds that contrast with its dark green veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground runners.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that makes it easily identifiable in the wild.</p>
