<p>Diplazium macrotis, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Diplazium macrotis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
