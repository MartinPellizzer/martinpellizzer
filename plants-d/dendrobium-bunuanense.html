<p>Dendrobium bunuanense, commonly known as the Bunuan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bunuanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
