                    <h1>Desmodium spirale var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Desmodium spirale var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping sicklepod, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sickle-shaped leaflet, and its stems are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or pink, followed by narrow, spiral-shaped pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a weed and a forage plant.</p>
