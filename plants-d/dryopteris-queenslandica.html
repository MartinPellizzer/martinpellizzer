                    <h1>Dryopteris queenslandica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
