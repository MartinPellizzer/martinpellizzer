                    <h1>Diastella parilis</h1>
<p>Diastella parilis, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable botanical feature. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>The plant's ancient lineage and distinctive appearance contribute to its significance in the study of cycads.</p>
