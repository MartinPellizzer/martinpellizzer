<p>Dortmanna lacustris, commonly known as the lake dock, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Dortmanna lacustris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
