                    <h1>Dendrophthora elliptica var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora elliptica var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has smooth, elliptical leaves that are typically broader than they are long, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure allows it to absorb water and some nutrients from its host while also photosynthesizing independently.</p>
