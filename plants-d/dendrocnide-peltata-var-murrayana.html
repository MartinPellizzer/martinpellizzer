                    <h1>Dendrocnide peltata var. murrayana</h1>
<p>Dendrocnide peltata var. murrayana, commonly known as the Murray's stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle found in the eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, hollow hairs that release a potent irritant when touched. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by humans and livestock.</p>
