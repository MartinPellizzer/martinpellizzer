<p>Dendrobium strebloceras var. rossianum, commonly known as the Rossian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal droughts.</p>
<p>The variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes.</p>
