                    <h1>Deschampsia setacea f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Deschampsia setacea f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous tussock grass, is a variant of the slender hair grass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. One notable botanical trait is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds are formed on the mother plant and can germinate before dispersal.</p>
<p>This adaptation enhances its ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
