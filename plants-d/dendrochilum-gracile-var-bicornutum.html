<p>Dendrochilum gracile var. bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned slender tree orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tree-like growth habit and delicate, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
