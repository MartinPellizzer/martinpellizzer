<p>Disyphonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in low light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Disyphonia is native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
