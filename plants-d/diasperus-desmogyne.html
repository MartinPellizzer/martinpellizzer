<p>Diasperus desmogyne, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, allowing it to conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Diasperus desmogyne is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
