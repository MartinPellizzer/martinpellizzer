                    <h1>Dryopteris perrieriana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris perrieriana, commonly known as the Perrier's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the genus Dryopteris.</p>
