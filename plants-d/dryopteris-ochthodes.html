                    <h1>Dryopteris ochthodes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris ochthodes, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a reddish or rusty hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
