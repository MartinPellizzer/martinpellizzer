<p>Dryopteris austroussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
