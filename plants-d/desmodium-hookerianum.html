                    <h1>Desmodium hookerianum</h1>
<p>Desmodium hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
