<p>Dendrobium masarangense, commonly known as the Masarangense orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dendrobium masarangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
