                    <h1>Dryopteris speciosa var. assamica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris speciosa var. assamica, commonly known as the Assam Shield Fern, is a variant of the sword fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
