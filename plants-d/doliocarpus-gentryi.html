<p>Doliocarpus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's doliocarpus, is a rare and little-known species within the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are drupes, which contain a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, sometimes edible pericarp.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Doliocarpus gentryi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
