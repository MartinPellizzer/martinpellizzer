                    <h1>Duravia</h1>
<p>Duravia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions under moonlight. The plant has a short lifespan, blooming only once during its brief existence. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow, which attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Duravia is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
