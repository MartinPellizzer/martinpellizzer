                    <h1>Dendrophylax monteverdi</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax monteverdi, commonly known as the Monteverde's orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It grows on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and decaying plant matter rather than soil. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring the cool, humid conditions of high-altitude rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
