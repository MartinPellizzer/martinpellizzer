                <h1>Dendrobium semifuscum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium semifuscum, commonly known as the dusky phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, often with a subtle speckled pattern. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium semifuscum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in both home and commercial settings.</p>
