                    <h1>Drepania</h1>
<p>Drepania, commonly known as the basket fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble baskets, hence their common name. Drepania species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils.</p>
