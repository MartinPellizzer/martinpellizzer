                    <h1>Dryopteris angustifrons</h1>
<p>Dryopteris angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, pointed segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
