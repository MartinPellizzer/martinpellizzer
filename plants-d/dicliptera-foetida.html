                    <h1>Dicliptera foetida</h1>
<p>Dicliptera foetida, commonly known as the stinking panic grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
