<p>Dendrobium butchcamposii, commonly known as the Butch Campos' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>

Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Dendrobium butchcamposii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
