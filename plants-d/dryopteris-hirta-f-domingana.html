                    <h1>Dryopteris hirta f. domingana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris hirta f. domingana, commonly known as the Domingan Shield Fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
