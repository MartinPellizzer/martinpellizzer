<p>Diplazium andicola, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
