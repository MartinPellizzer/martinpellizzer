                            <h1>Diphasium Complanatum</h1>
<p>Flat-leaved duckweed, scientifically known as Diphasium complanatum, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, allowing it to absorb sunlight efficiently for photosynthesis. This species is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms. Despite its simple appearance, Flat-leaved duckweed is an important indicator of ecosystem health and water clarity. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable resource and a potential nuisance in aquatic habitats.</p>
