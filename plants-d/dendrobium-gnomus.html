<p>Dendrobium gnomus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, adapted to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrobium gnomus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
