<p>Diodia radula subsp.</p>
<p>venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan sandweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often in coastal or arid regions. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other Diodia species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
