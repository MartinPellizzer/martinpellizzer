                    <h1>Drupifera</h1>
<p>Drupifera, commonly known as a type of fruit-bearing plant, is characterized by its drupes, which are fleshy fruits with a hard pit or stone inside.</p>
<p>These plants typically belong to the蔷薇科 (Rosaceae) family and include species such as peaches, cherries, and plums. The botanical structure of drupes consists of an outer fleshy exocarp, a middle fleshy mesocarp, and a hard endocarp that encloses the seed. Drupifera plants are often deciduous, shedding their leaves seasonally, and they rely on animals for seed dispersal through their attractive fruits.</p>
<p>Their growth habits and fruit structures make them important in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
