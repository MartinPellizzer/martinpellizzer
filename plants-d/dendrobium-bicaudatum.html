                    <h1>Dendrobium bicaudatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium bicaudatum, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a unique growth habit with two distinct, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble tails, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bicaudatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
