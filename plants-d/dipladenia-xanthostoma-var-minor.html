<p>Dipladenia xanthostoma var. minor, commonly known as the miniature yellow dipladenia, is a compact, trailing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, velvety leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size, it is ideal for small spaces and containers.</p>
