                    <h1>Diplotaxis viminea var. prolongoi</h1>
<p>Diplotaxis viminea var. prolongoi, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, three-lobed bracts that enclose the seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its role in stabilizing dunes in its native habitat.</p>
