<p>Diplazium andapense, commonly known as the Andaman cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender rhizome and produces a dense cluster of sterile fronds that are often mistaken for fertile ones. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky slopes and cliff faces. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>Diplazium andapense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its rocky habitat.</p>
