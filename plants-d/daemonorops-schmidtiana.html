<p>Daemonorops schmidtiana, commonly known as the Schmidt's palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spiky capsule that matures over several months.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
