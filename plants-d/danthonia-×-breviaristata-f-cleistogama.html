                    <h1>Danthonia × breviaristata f. cleistogama</h1>
<p>Danthonia × breviaristata f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of the narrowleaf grass, is a botanical variant characterized by its production of cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinated.</p>
<p>This form is a naturally occurring hybrid between Danthonia breviaristata and Danthonia arenicola, resulting in a plant with intermediate morphological traits. It typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, exhibiting a low, compact growth habit. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems through soil binding and habitat provision for small invertebrates.</p>
