                    <h1>Davallia kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Davallia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the montane forests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Davallia kinabaluensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
