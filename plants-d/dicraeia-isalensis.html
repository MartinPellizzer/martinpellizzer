                    <h1>Dicraeia isalensis</h1>
<p>Dicraeia isalensis, commonly known as the Isalense Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Dicraeia isalensis is adapted to thrive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its growth form and morphology make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat.</p>
