<p>Dryopteris killipii, commonly known as Killip's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
