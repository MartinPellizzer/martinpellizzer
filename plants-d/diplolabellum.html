                    <h1>Diplolabellum</h1>
<p>Diplolabellum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant has thin, wiry roots and produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers with a unique labellum structure. It is known for its difficulty in cultivation due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats.</p>
