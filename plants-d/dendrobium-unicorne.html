<p>Dendrobium unicorne, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Dendrobium unicorne is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
