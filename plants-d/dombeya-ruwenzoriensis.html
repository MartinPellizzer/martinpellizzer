The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
