<p>Diplycosia retusa, commonly known as the hairy leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
