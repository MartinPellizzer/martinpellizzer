                    <h1>Dracula lindstroemii</h1>
<p>Dracula lindstroemii, commonly known as the Lindstrom's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often dark red or purple flowers that resemble a vampire's lips. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-drained, loose soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
