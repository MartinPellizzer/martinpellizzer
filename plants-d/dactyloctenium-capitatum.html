                    <h1>Dactyloctenium capitatum</h1>
<p>Dactyloctenium capitatum, commonly known as the cluster grass or flatgrass, is a tropical perennial grass native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often rolled at the edges, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
