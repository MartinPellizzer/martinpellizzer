                    <h1>Drosera xerophila</h1>
<p>Drosera xerophila, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sticky leaves covered in glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments, often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>Drosera xerophila is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
