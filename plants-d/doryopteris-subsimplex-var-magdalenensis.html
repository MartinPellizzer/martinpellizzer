<p>Doryopteris subsimplex var. magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
