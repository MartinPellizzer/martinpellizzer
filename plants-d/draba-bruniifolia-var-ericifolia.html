                    <h1>Draba bruniifolia var. ericifolia</h1>
<p>Draba bruniifolia var. ericifolia, commonly known as the Ericaceous Draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its association with ericaceous (heath-like) vegetation, contributing to its specific ecological niche.</p>
