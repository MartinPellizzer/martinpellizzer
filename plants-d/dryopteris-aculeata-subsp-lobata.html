<p>Dryopteris aculeata subsp.</p>
<p>lobata, commonly known as the lobate wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often described as having a "butterfly" shape.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
