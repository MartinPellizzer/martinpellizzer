                    <h1>Didymocarpus minutus</h1>
<p>Didymocarpus minutus, commonly known as the small-fruited sand mat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience in harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
