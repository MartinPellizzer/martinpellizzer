                    <h1>Dryopteris belensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris belensis, commonly known as the Belin's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Dryopteris belensis reflects its evolutionary adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
