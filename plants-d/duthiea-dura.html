                    <h1>Duthiea dura</h1>
<p>Duthiea dura, commonly known as the hardy duthie, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Duthiea dura is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
