                    <h1>Dryopteris sauvallei</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sauvallei, commonly known as the Sauval's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year, providing a lush appearance even in winter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into a complex pattern of pinnae and pinnules, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
