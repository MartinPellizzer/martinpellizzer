                    <h1>Desmodium latifolium</h1>
<p>Desmodium latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that mature into achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Desmodium latifolium is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects.</p>
