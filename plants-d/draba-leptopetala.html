                    <h1>Draba leptopetala</h1>
<p>Draba leptopetala, commonly known as the slender-petaled whitlow grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. Draba leptopetala is adapted to harsh climates, often surviving in nutrient-poor soils and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its alpine habitat.</p>
