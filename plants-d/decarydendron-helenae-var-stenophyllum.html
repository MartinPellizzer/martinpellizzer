<p>Decarydendron helenae var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Helen's tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its varietal name "stenophyllum.". The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
