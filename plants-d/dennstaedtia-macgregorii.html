                    <h1>Dennstaedtia macgregorii</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots, which help anchor it in the soil.</p>
