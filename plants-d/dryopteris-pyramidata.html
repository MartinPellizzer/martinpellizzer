<p>Dryopteris pyramidata, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that remain lush throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The fronds are lance-shaped with a serrated margin and a unique, pyramidal arrangement of pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
