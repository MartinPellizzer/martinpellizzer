                    <h1>Dorstenia letestui</h1>
<p>Dorstenia letestui, commonly known as the "Fairy Flute," is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems that resemble the shape of a flute, often curling and twisting as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Dorstenia letestui is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
