                    <h1>Draco cinnabari</h1>
<p>Draco cinnabari, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The tree produces a red resin, known as dragon's blood, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and adaptations reflect its evolution in a harsh, dry climate.</p>
