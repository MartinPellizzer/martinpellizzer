                    <h1>Dendrobium sematoglossum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sematoglossum, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive, hairy lip. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sematoglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
