<p>Drymaria villosa var. perennis, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
