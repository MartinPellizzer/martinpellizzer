                    <h1>Diodonopsis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Diodonopsis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
