                    <h1>Delphinium vitifolium</h1>
<p>Delphinium vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are palmately compound, with elongated, grape-like leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for ornamental use in gardens.</p>
