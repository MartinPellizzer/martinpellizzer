                    <h1>Delphinium crassifolium var. stubendorffii</h1>
<p>Delphinium crassifolium var. stubendorffii, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows.</p>
