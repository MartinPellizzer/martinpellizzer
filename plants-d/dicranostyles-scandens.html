<p>Dicranostyles scandens, commonly known as the climbing moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of delicate, leafy shoots that often form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The leaves are typically narrow and have a pointed tip, with a smooth or slightly ribbed surface. This plant thrives in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can anchor itself to substrates.</p>
<p>Dicranostyles scandens plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
