<p>Dendrobium boosii, commonly known as the Boosii orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb-like stem that stores water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium boosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
