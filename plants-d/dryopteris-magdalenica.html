<p>Dryopteris magdalenica, commonly known as the Magdalena wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, with the sterile fronds usually appearing first before the fertile ones in the spring.</p>
