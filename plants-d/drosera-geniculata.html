                    <h1>Drosera geniculata</h1>
<p>Drosera geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb and trap prey. The plant produces small, sticky glands on its leaves that secrete a sweet-smelling mucus to lure insects. These insects become stuck and are digested by the plant's enzymes.</p>
<p>Drosera geniculata thrives in moist, boggy environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense vegetation.</p>
