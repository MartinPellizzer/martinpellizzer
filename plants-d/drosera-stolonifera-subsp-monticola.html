<p>Drosera stolonifera subsp.</p>
<p>monticola, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
