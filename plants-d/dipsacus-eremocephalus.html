<p>Dipsacus eremocephalus, commonly known as the desert gothic or hairy goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking, spiky, purplish-red flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Dipsacus eremocephalus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in conditions of extreme drought and heat.</p>
