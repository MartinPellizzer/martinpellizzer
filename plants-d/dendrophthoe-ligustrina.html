                    <h1>Dendrophthoe ligustrina</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe ligustrina, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves the germination of seeds on the host's bark, followed by the establishment of a haustorium to penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe ligustrina is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.</p>
