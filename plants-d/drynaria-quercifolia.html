                    <h1>Drynaria quercifolia</h1>
<p>Drynaria quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, oak-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often resemble the shape of an oak leaf. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a dense, lush appearance throughout the year.</p>
