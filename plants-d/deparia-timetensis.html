<p>Deparia timetensis, commonly known as the Timetense Wood Fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
