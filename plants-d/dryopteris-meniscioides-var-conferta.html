<p>Dryopteris meniscioides var. conferta, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are densely packed and often arching in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are stout and often covered with a layer of brown, scaly tissue, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and remain throughout the year, making it a valuable ornamental plant in shaded garden settings.</p>
