<p>Dactylorhiza euxina subsp.</p>
<p>armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
