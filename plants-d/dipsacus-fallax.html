<p>Dipsacus fallax, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, velvety seed heads that form during the second year of growth. The plant has upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas.</p>
