                    <h1>Drosera peltata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Drosera peltata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-surface sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other Drosera species.</p>
<p>This variant is prized by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
