<p>Delissea subcordata var. waialaeensis, commonly known as the Kauai silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and silvery, hairy foliage. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers, typically blooming once every few years. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
