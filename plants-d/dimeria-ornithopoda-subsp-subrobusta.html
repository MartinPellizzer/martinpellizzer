<p>Dimeria ornithopoda subsp.</p>
<p>subrobusta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an indicator species of dry environments.</p>
