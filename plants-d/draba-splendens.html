<p>Draba splendens, commonly known as the splendour whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Draba splendens is noted for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
