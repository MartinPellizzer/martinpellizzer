                    <h1>Draconanthes</h1>
<p>Draconanthes, commonly known as the dragon's breath orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often fiery red or orange flowers that resemble a dragon's breath. Native to the humid cloud forests of Central and South America, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique floral structure includes long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Draconanthes is often protected in its natural habitat.</p>
