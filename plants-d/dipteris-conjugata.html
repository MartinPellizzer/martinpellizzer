<p>Dipteris conjugata, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Dipteris conjugata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
