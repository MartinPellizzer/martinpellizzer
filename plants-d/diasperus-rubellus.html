<p>Diasperus rubellus, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cariophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Diasperus rubellus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
