                    <h1>Dracula ophioceps</h1>
<p>Dracula ophioceps, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a highly endangered species.</p>
