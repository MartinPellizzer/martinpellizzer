                    <h1>Dryopteris sieboldii var. heteroneura</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sieboldii var. heteroneura, commonly known as the Siebold's wood fern, is a variant of the Japanese wood fern characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate fronds with a unique, asymmetrical arrangement of pinnae, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
