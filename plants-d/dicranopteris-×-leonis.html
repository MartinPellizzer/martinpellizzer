                    <h1>Dicranopteris × leonis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris × leonis, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Dicranopteris malabarica* and *Dicranopteris quadrifaria*.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its fronds are usually light green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive veining pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce spores and is often found as a vegetative clone in natural habitats.</p>
