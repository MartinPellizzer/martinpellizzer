                    <h1>Dryopteris currorii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris currorii, commonly known as the Curran's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, narrow, and serrated leaf blade. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense clumps. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
