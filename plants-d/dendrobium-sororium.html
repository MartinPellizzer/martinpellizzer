<p>Dendrobium sororium, commonly known as the orchid with the "butterfly" shape, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a butterfly.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
