<p>Drepadenium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often divided into two branches, giving it its name. Its leaves are closely spaced and lack distinct veins, a characteristic common in many liverworts.</p>
<p>Drepadenium dichotomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
