<p>Dryopteris thomassetii, commonly known as the Thomasset's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
