                    <h1>Drosera preissii</h1>
<p>Drosera preissii, commonly known as the Cape Dewplant, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular trichomes that produce digestive enzymes to break down prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and ecology.</p>
