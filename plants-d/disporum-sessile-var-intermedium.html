                    <h1>Disporum sessile var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Disporum sessile var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in understory habitats where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
