                    <h1>Dorystephania borneensis</h1>
<p>Dorystephania borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean dodder vine, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has a slender, vine-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. It produces yellowish flowers and is adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
