<p>Dendrophthoe pendens, commonly known as the hanging or spider orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendulous stems that often hang from trees, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called phylloclades that perform photosynthesis. It attaches to host trees through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe pendens is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, humid environments.</p>
