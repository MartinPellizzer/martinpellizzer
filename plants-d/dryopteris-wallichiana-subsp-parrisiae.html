<p>Dryopteris wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>parrisiae, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
