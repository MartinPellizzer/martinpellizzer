<p>Doodia media var. moorei, commonly known as the Moore's fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features delicate, arching fronds with a feathery appearance, and its leaves are typically dark green with a glossy texture.
