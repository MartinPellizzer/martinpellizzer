                    <h1>Dracula platycrater</h1>
<p>Dracula platycrater, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, blood-red bracts that resemble a dragon's tongue, hence its common name. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
