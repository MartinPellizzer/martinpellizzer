<p>Diplazium moranii, commonly known as the Moran's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has long, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a feathery appearance. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium moranii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
