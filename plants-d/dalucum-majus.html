<p>Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of rainfall. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and contain spores for propagation. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil.</p>
