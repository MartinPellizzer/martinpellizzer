<p>Delphinium cyphoplectrum subsp.</p>
<p>stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens.</p>
