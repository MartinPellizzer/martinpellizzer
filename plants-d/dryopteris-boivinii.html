                    <h1>Dryopteris boivinii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
