                    <h1>Dryopteris aliena</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aliena, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically pale green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can establish dense colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds and are covered by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
