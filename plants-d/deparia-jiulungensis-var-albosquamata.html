                    <h1>Deparia jiulungensis var. albosquamata</h1>
<p>Deparia jiulungensis var. albosquamata, commonly known as the white-scaled water fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant's most distinctive feature is the presence of white, squamose (scale-like) structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
