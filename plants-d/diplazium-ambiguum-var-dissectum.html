<p>Diplazium ambiguum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
