                    <h1>Dicranopteris grandis</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris grandis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
