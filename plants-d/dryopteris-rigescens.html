                    <h1>Dryopteris rigescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rigescens, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The fern's hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates.</p>
