                    <h1>Dryopteris malodora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris malodora, commonly known as the stinking wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's common name refers to its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fronds are crushed.</p>
