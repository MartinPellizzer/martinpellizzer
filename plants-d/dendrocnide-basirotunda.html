                    <h1>Dendrocnide basirotunda</h1>
<p>Dendrocnide basirotunda, commonly known as the broad-leaf stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and stinging nettle species, and is characterized by its toxic, hair-like structures called trichomes. The leaves are typically large, broad, and have a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its potent urticating hairs, it is often avoided by humans and animals alike.</p>
