                    <h1>Dryopteris nigrisquama</h1>
<p>Dryopteris nigrisquama, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
