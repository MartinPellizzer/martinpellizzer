                    <h1>Dichopsis helferi</h1>
<p>Dichopsis helferi, commonly known as the star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with ribbed stems that often branch into a star-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dichopsis helferi is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
