                    <h1>Dracula felix</h1>
<p>Dracula felix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Dracula felix is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
