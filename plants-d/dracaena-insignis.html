                    <h1>Dracaena insignis</h1>
<p>Dracaena insignis, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its flowering. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena insignis is a popular houseplant due to its ability to tolerate low light and minimal care.</p>
