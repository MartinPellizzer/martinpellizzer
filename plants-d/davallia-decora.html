<p>Davallia decora, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like colonies.</p>
<p>Davallia decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.</p>
