                    <h1>Diplazium lobatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium lobatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Diplazium lobatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
