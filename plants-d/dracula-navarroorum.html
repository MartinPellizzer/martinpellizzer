<p>Dracula navarroorum, commonly known as the Navarro's dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with long, drooping petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive hooded shape that resembles a bat, giving it its dramatic common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
