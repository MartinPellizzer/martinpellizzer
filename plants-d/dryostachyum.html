                    <h1>Dryostachyum</h1>
<p>Dryostachyum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of grasses native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Dryostachyum species are typically perennial, with rhizomatous growth habits that allow them to form dense mats or clumps. They prefer well-drained soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its architectural form and drought tolerance.</p>
