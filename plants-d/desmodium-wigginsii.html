                    <h1>Desmodium wigginsii</h1>
<p>Desmodium wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' sensitive plant, is a species of legume native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Desmodium wigginsii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
