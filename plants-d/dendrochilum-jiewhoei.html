<p>Dendrochilum jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoe's tree orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
