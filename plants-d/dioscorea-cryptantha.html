<p>Dioscorea cryptantha, commonly known as the desert yam, is a perennial vine native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family, which includes other yam species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
