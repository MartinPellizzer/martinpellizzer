                    <h1>Daucus parsae</h1>
<p>Daucus parsae, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant features a taproot that is typically smaller and less commercially valuable than that of the common carrot. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Daucus parsae is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and adaptability to arid climates.</p>
