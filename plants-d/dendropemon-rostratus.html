                    <h1>Dendropemon rostratus</h1>
<p>Dendropemon rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive rostrum-like structure on the lip. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within the rainforest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
