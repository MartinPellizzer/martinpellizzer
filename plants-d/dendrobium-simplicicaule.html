<p>Dendrobium simplicicaule, commonly known as the simple-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that are often covered in a layer of white or grayish bark. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium simplicicaule is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
