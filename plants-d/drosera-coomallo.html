<p>Drosera coomallo, commonly known as the Coomallo Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Drosera coomallo is an important species for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
