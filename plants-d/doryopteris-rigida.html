                    <h1>Doryopteris rigida</h1>
<p>Doryopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Doryopteris rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
