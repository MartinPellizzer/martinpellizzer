<p>Dryopteris taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
