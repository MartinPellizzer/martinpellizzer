<p>Diplazium hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Diplazium hewittii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
