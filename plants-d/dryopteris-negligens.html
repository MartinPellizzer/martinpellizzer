                    <h1>Dryopteris negligens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris negligens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, delicate appearance with a grayish-green color and a finely toothed margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
