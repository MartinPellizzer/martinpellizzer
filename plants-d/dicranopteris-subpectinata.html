                    <h1>Dicranopteris subpectinata</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris subpectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are usually divided into small, serrated segments, which help in capturing light and nutrients in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams.</p>
