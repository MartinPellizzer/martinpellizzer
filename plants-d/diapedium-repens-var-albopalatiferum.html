<p>Diapedium repens var. albopalatiferum, commonly known as the white palatal diapedium, is a rare variant of the diapedium plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or near water bodies. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a slight waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral coloration and limited distribution.</p>
