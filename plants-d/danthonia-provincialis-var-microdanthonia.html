                    <h1>Danthonia provincialis var. microdanthonia</h1>
<p>Danthonia provincialis var. microdanthonia, commonly known as the small danthonia, is a grass species native to the southern United States, particularly found in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils with low nutrient content.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
