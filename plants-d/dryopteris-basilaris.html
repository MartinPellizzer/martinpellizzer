                    <h1>Dryopteris basilaris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris basilaris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris basilaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize rocky habitats.</p>
