<p>Disarrhenum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads similar to those of true dandelions.</p>
<p>Disarrhenum species are often found in moist, disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings.</p>
