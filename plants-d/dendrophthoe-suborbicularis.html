<p>Dendrophthoe suborbicularis, commonly known as the suborbicular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant has a fleshy, leafy stem that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress on its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
