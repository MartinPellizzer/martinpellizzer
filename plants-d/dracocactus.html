                    <h1>Dracocactus</h1>
<p>Dracocactus, commonly known as the dragon cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several feet in length. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
