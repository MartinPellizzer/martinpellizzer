                    <h1>Dryopteris dilatata var. deltoidea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dilatata var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta maidenhair fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and woodland settings.</p>
