<p>Desmodiocassia, commonly known as the African bean tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its edible pods, which resemble beans, and its ornamental value. Desmodiocassia species are typically shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters.</p>
<p>They play an important role in agroforestry and soil conservation due to their nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
