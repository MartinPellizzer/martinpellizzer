                    <h1>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola var. hoeppneri</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza sphagnicola var. hoeppneri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic peat bogs and is closely associated with sphagnum moss, which provides the moist, nutrient-poor environment it requires. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are highly adapted to the waterlogged conditions, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened and is protected in many areas.</p>
