                    <h1>Diasperus incurvus</h1>
<p>Diasperus incurvus, commonly known as the curved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits known as burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also serves as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
