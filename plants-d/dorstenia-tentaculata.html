                    <h1>Dorstenia tentaculata</h1>
<p>Dorstenia tentaculata, commonly known as the "tentacle plant," is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, spirally arranged leaves that resemble tendrils, which help it climb and anchor to supports. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dorstenia tentaculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage.</p>
