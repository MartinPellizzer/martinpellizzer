                    <h1>Dryopteris stokesii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris stokesii, commonly known as the Stokes' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories.</p>
