                            <h1>Dracaena Conspicua</h1>
<p>Dracaena conspicua is a striking evergreen plant native to parts of Southeast Asia known for its vibrant, sword-like leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air. Its unique appearance makes it a favorite for adding a touch of tropical elegance to any space. With proper care, Dracaena conspicua can flourish for years, bringing both beauty and health benefits to its surroundings.</p>
