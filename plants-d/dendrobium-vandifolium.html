                    <h1>Dendrobium vandifolium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium vandifolium, commonly known as the Vandifolium orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its often-dry habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium vandifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
