<p>Dryopteris wladiwostokensis, commonly known as the Vladivostok wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteris genus, which includes various types of wood ferns, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
