                    <h1>Davallia pilosa</h1>
<p>Davallia pilosa, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the paw prints of a hare, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded lobes that give the plant a soft, lace-like appearance.</p>
