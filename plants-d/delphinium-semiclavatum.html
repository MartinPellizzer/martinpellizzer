                    <h1>Delphinium semiclavatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium semiclavatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other delphinium species, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
