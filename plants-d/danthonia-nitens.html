<p>It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a component of native plant gardens.</p>
