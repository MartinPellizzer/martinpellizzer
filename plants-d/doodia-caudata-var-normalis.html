<p>Doodia caudata var. normalis, commonly known as the common fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
