                    <h1>Diaphyllum triradiatum</h1>
<p>Diaphyllum triradiatum, commonly known as the three-rayed diaphyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that exhibit a unique radial symmetry. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diaphyllum triradiatum is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
