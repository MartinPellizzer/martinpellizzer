                    <h1>Dactylorhiza × lehmannii</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza × lehmannii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near waterlogged soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears spike-like inflorescences of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza macdougallii and Dactylorhiza viridiflora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and fen meadows.</p>
