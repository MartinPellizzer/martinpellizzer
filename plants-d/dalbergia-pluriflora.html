                    <h1>Dalbergia pluriflora</h1>
<p>Dalbergia pluriflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, hard, and usually dark-colored pods that contain several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>
