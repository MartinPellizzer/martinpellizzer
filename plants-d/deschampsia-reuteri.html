<p>Deschampsia reuteri, commonly known as Reuter's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, leaf-like blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
