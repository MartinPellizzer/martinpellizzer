<p>Drymoglossum microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and features small, narrowly elliptical leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are usually short and stout, emerging from the leaf tips.</p>
<p>This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
