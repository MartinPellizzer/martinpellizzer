                    <h1>Drosera andersoniana</h1>
<p>Drosera andersoniana, commonly known as the Anderson's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with small, rosette-shaped leaves that form a compact structure. It produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months, often in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>
