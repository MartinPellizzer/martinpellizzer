<p>Draba volcanica var. umbelliflora, commonly known as the volcanic draba, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
