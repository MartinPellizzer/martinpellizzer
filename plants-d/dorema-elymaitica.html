                    <h1>Dorema elymaitica</h1>
<p>Dorema elymaitica, commonly known as the Elymaitic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Dorema elymaitica plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
