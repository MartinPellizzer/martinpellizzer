<p>Dulacia acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches itself to the stems of other plants, forming a dense network of tendrils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers produce small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Dulacia acuta is found in various regions, often in disturbed or open habitats where it can easily find a host.</p>
