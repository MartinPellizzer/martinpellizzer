                    <h1>Diosma scoparia</h1>
<p>Diosma scoparia, commonly known as the desert diosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Diosma scoparia is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
