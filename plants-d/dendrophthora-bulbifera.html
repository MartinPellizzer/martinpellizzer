                    <h1>Dendrophthora bulbifera</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its unique growth habit, where it produces bulb-like structures that store nutrients. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through its haustoria. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
