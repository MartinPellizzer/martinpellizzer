                    <h1>Dryopteris melanolepis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris melanolepis, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with small, blackish spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore release.</p>
