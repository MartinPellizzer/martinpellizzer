<p>Diplazium huttonii, commonly known as Hutton's water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
