                    <h1>Diospyros sapota</h1>
<p>Diospyros sapota, commonly known as the cherimoya, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces a sweet, creamy fruit with a unique, aromatic flavor, often described as a blend of banana, pineapple, and vanilla. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, and the tree is typically dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants are required for fruiting.</p>
<p>The sapota thrives in warm, humid climates and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities.</p>
