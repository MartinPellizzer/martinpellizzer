                    <h1>Diothonea lehmanniana</h1>
<p>Diothonea lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected under South African law.</p>
