<p>Dryopteris atrosetosa, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sori.</p>
