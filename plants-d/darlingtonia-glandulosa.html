                <h1>Darlingtonia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Darlingtonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky false pitcher, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that resemble a pitcher, lined with a waxy coating that aids in trapping prey. The plant produces a sticky fluid inside the pitcher to immobilize insects, which are then digested by enzymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
<p>Darlingtonia glandulosa is also notable for its striking, often red or orange-tinged, flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
