<p>Delphinium emarginatum subsp.</p>
<p>nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
