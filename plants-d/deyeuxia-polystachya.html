                    <h1>Deyeuxia polystachya</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia polystachya, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia polystachya is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
