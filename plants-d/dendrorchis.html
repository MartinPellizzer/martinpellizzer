                    <h1>Dendrorchis</h1>
<p>Dendrorchis, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a genus of orchids native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. Dendrorchis species typically have long, arching stems with clustered, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The leaves are often broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
