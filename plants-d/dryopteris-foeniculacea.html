                    <h1>Dryopteris foeniculacea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris foeniculacea, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a carrot. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
