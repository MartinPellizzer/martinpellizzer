                    <h1>Dracula spectrum</h1>
<p>Dracula spectrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula spectrum is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
