                    <h1>Daphnopsis guacacoa</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis guacacoa, commonly known as the Guacacoa, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its botanical features include dark green, leathery leaves and bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, Daphnopsis guacacoa remains a poorly understood species within its native ecosystem.</p>
