<p>Davallia tasmanii subsp.</p>
<p>cristata, commonly known as the crested maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often display a distinctive crest or ridge along the midrib.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
