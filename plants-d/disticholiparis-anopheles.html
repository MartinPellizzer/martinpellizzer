<p>Disticholiparis anopheles, commonly known as the Anopheles fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arranged in a distichous pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to damp soil, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>
