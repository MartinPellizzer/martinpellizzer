<p>Dryopteris ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Dryopteris ambigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings due to its graceful appearance.</p>
