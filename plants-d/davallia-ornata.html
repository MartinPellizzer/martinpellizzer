                    <h1>Davallia ornata</h1>
<p>Davallia ornata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, rosette-shaped frond that resembles a bird's nest, with curled, fibrous leaf bases that trap moisture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it to trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Davallia ornata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
