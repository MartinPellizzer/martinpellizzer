<p>Dryopteris cicatricata, commonly known as the scarlet fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore release.</p>
