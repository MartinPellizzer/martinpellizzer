<p>Diplazium laffanianum, commonly known as the Laffan's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit. The plant features rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Diplazium laffanianum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation.</p>
