<p>Dactylis polygama, commonly known as broad-leaved cat's-tail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a cat's tail. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seeds enclosed in a hard casing.</p>
<p>Dactylis polygama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
