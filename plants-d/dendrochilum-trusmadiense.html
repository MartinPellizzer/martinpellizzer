<p>Dendrochilum trusmadiense, commonly known as the Trus Madi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
