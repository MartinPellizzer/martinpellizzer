                    <h1>Dendrochilum crassum</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum crassum, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tree-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Dendrochilum crassum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivated settings.</p>
