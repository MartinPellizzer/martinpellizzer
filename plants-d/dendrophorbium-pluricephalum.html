                    <h1>Dendrophorbium pluricephalum</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium pluricephalum, commonly known as the multi-headed forest parasite, is a unique plant species characterized by its ability to grow on the trunks of other trees.</p>
<p>It possesses multiple heads or shoots that emerge from a single root system, allowing it to spread across a wide area. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem that is often covered in a thick, moss-like coating. Its leaves are small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
