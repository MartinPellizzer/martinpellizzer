                    <h1>Dendrochilum perrineae</h1>
<p>Dendrochilum perrineae, commonly known as the Perrine's tree orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
