<p>Dactylorchis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Dactylorchis alpestris is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments where competition from other plants is minimal.</p>
