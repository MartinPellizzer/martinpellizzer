<p>Dipteris lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
