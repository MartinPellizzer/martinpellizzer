<p>Deyeuxia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia glomerata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
