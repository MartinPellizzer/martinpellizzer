<p>Dryopteris affinis subsp.</p>
<p>cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a fern species native to western Europe, particularly Wales and southern England. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically shorter than those of the nominate subspecies, and the sori are closely spaced along the veins. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
