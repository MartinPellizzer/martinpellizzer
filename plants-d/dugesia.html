                    <h1>Dugesia</h1>
<p>Dugesia, commonly known as a type of flatworm, is a genus of free-living turbellarians belonging to the family Dugesiidae.</p>
<p>These organisms are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Dugesia species are characterized by their elongated, dorsoventrally flattened bodies and a simple digestive system. They lack a circulatory system but have a muscular pharynx used for feeding on small organisms.</p>
<p>Their reproductive system includes both male and female reproductive organs, allowing for hermaphroditism in many species.</p>
