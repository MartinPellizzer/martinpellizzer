<p>Deparia japonica subsp.</p>
<p>sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the natural habitat.</p>
