<p>Drosera whittakeri subsp.</p>
<p>aberrans, commonly known as the Whittaker's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
