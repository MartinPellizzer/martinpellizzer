<p>Dactylis glomerata f. amplectens, commonly known as the clasping oat, is a variant of the common oat that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences and the presence of clasping sheaths around the stem, which give it its name. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including those that are nutrient-poor. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
