                    <h1>Digitaria setivalva</h1>
<p>Digitaria setivalva, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, velvety texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Digitaria setivalva is both an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
