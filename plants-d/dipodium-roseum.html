                    <h1>Dipodium roseum</h1>
<p>Dipodium roseum, commonly known as the pink fern, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with consistently moist soil. The plant features small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage displays a unique pinkish hue, especially when young, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
