                    <h1>Dorstenia holtziana</h1>
<p>Dorstenia holtziana, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a unique member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its swollen, bottle-like stems that store water, adapting to its often arid habitat. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant that can be grown in containers or as a houseplant with proper care.</p>
