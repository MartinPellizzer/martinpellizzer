                    <h1>Digitaria aridicola</h1>
<p>Digitaria aridicola, commonly known as the desert digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
