<p>Doria spinescens, commonly known as the spiny doria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.

<p>Doria spinescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
