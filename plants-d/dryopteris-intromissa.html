                    <h1>Dryopteris intromissa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris intromissa, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fertile fronds.</p>
