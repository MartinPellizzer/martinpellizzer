                    <h1>Drymaria xerophylla</h1>
<p>Drymaria xerophylla, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings.</p>
<p>Drymaria xerophylla is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
