<p>Dendrobium sarcostoma, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sarcostoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
