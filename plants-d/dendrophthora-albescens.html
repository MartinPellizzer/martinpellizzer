                    <h1>Dendrophthora albescens</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora albescens, commonly known as the white-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically pale green to white, which helps it blend with its surroundings and avoid detection by herbivores. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
