<p>glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved darwiniothamnus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its subspecific name.</p>

<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
