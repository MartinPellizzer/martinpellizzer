                    <h1>Dryopteris brunneovillosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris brunneovillosa, commonly known as the brown-hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in a dense layer of brown, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually deciduous, shedding in the fall, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's unique hairy texture and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
