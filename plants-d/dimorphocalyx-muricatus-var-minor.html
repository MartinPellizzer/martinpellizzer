                    <h1>Dimorphocalyx muricatus var. minor</h1>
<p>Dimorphocalyx muricatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form of Dimorphocalyx muricatus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
