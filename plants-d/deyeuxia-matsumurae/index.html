<p>Deyeuxia matsumurae is a rare and unique grass species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is known for its delicate, slender leaves and compact growth habit. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Studying Deyeuxia matsumurae provides valuable insights into grassland ecology and plant adaptation.</p>
