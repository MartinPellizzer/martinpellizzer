<p>Diplazium rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosentrock's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
