<p>Digitaria trichopodia, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and ornamental settings.</p>
