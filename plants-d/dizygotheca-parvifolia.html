<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means.</p>
