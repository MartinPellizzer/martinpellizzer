<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
