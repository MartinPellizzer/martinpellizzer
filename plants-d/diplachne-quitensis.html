                    <h1>Diplachne quitensis</h1>
<p>Diplachne quitensis, commonly known as the Andean flatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Diplachne quitensis has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in grassland ecology.</p>
