                    <h1>Diapedium resupinatum</h1>
<p>Diapedium resupinatum, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that often hang from submerged vegetation. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Diapedium resupinatum thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight.</p>
