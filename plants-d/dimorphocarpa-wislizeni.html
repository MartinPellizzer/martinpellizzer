<p>Dimorphocarpa wislizeni, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>Dimorphocarpa wislizeni is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
