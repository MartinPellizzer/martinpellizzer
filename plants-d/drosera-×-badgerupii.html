                    <h1>Drosera × badgerupii</h1>
<p>Drosera × badgerupii, commonly known as the hybrid sundew, is a carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Drosera binata and Drosera indica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects. This hybrid is native to Australia and thrives in wet, boggy environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid and its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
