<p>Dicranopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris jamaicensis plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
