<p>Dryopteris opaca, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically unbranched and have a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Dryopteris opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded garden settings.</p>
