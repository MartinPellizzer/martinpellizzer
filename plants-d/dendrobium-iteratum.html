                    <h1>Dendrobium iteratum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium iteratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a fragrant aroma, and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Dendrobium iteratum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
