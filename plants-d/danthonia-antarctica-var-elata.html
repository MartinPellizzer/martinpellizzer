                    <h1>Danthonia antarctica var. elata</h1>
<p>Danthonia antarctica var. elata, commonly known as the Antarctic grass or Antarctic danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Antarctica and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wind-swept environments and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of the vegetation in polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
