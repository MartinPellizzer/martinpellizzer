<p>Dryopteris crenulatoserrulata, commonly known as the serrulate wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, finely toothed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate and elegant appearance. Native to eastern North America, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
