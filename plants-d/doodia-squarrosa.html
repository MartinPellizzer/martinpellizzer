<p>Doodia squarrosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a stout, creeping rhizome with broadly ovate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in soft, rusty-brown hairs. The fronds are typically 30â€“60 cm long and have a distinctive, arching appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released in the spring.</p>
