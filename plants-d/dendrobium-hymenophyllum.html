<p>Dendrobium hymenophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific host trees for support rather than soil. Its unique morphology and elusive nature make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
