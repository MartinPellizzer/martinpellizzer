                    <h1>Dendrobium aliciae</h1>
<p>Dendrobium aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warm season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium aliciae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
