                    <h1>Draba uncinalis</h1>
<p>Draba uncinalis, commonly known as the bent-leaf whitlowgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba uncinalis is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
