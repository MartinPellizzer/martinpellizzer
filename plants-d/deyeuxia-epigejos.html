                    <h1>Deyeuxia epigejos</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia epigejos, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia epigejos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
