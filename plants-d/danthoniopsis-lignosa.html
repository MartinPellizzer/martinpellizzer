<p>Danthoniopsis lignosa, commonly known as the woody muhly, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Danthoniopsis lignosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
