                    <h1>Dendrophylax sallei</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax sallei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in areas with high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
