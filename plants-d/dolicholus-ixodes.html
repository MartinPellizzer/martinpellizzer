<p>Dolicholus ixodes, commonly known as the Gulf Coast tick, is a species of tick belonging to the family Ixodidae.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic arthropod that feeds on the blood of various vertebrates, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. Botanically, it is not a plant but an arachnid, so it does not have the typical botanical features such as roots, stems, or leaves. However, its life cycle involves stages that may interact with plant hosts, particularly during the larval and nymphal stages.</p>
<p>This tick is commonly found in grassy and wooded areas, where it can attach to passing hosts.</p>
