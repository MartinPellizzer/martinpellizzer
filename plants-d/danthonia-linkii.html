                    <h1>Danthonia linkii</h1>
<p>Danthonia linkii, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and sandy beaches. Danthonia linkii plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive success in open, coastal habitats.</p>
