<p>Disticholiparis cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's disticholiparis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which consists of two rows of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems and its potential for medicinal research.</p>
