                            <h1>Dorstenia Multiformis Var. Ceratosanthes</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Dorstenia multiformis var. ceratosanthes, is a striking plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is prized for its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Despite its ornamental appeal, the plant is also noted for its unique, waxy leaves that often curl and twist in response to environmental conditions. While it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, it requires careful attention to soil and moisture levels to prevent stress. Its ability to adapt and flourish makes it a fascinating subject for both botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
