                    <h1>Dalbergia thomsonii</h1>
<p>Dalbergia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, well-drained soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
