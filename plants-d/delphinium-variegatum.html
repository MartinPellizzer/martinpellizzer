                    <h1>Delphinium variegatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with white or yellow markings, which give it its "variegated" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to livestock and humans.</p>
