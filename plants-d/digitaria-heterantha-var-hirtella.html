<p>Digitaria heterantha var. hirtella, commonly known as hairy digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>This grass is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
