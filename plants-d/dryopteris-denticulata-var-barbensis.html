<p>Dryopteris denticulata var. barbensis, commonly known as the Barben Island fern, is a variant of the finely toothed wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
