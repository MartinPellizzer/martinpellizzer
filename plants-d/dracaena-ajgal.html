<p>Dracaena ajgal, commonly known as the desert dragon tree, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its sandy environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife.
