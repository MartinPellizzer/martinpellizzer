<p>Danthonia decumbens f. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-leaved mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
