                    <h1>Distictella reticulata</h1>
<p>Distictella reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, net-like pattern of thallus structures, which give it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
