<p>Dendrophthora lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance.</p>
