                    <h1>Drosera australis</h1>
<p>Drosera australis, commonly known as the Australian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and covered in a layer of dew-like secretions.</p>
<p>Drosera australis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
