<p>Dryopteris filix-mas var. serratodentata, commonly known as the serrated tooth fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that becomes more refined as the plant matures. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, tropical foliage.</p>
