                    <h1>Dendrobium crystallinum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium crystallinum, commonly known as the crystal orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its unique feature is the presence of calcified structures on its stems, which give it the common name "crystal orchid.".</p>
<p>Dendrobium crystallinum requires specific care, including bright indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive.</p>
