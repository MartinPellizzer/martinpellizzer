                    <h1>Dryopteris subramosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris subramosa, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
