                    <h1>Drosera lusitanica</h1>
<p>Drosera lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Drosera lusitanica is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing essential nutrients in its nutrient-deficient habitat.</p>
