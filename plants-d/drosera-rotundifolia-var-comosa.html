                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia var. comosa</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a variant of the round-leaved sundew native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of glandular hairs on its leaves, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic peat bogs and heaths, thriving in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
