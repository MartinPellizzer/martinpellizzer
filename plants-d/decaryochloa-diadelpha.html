<p>Decaryochloa diadelpha, commonly known as the two-lobed grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its fine, tufted grass blades and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps it to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
