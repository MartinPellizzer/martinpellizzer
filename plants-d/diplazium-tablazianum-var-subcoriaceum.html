                    <h1>Diplazium tablazianum var. subcoriaceum</h1>
<p>Diplazium tablazianum var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, upright rhizomes and the presence of a distinct, shield-like structure on its fronds. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, linear pinnae that give the plant a compact appearance. The fronds are often covered with a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
