<p>Diploblechnum integripinnulum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually pinnately compound, with a smooth, unbroken margin that distinguishes it from similar species.</p>
