<p>Dryopteris hirtipes subsp.</p>
<p>atrata, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that often have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern.</p>
