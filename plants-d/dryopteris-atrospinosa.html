                    <h1>Dryopteris atrospinosa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris atrospinosa, commonly known as the black scale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
