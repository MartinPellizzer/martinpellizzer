<p>Diplazium urticifolium var. mesoamericanum, commonly known as the Mesoamerican stinging nettle, is a herbaceous fern characterized by its fern-like fronds and stinging hairs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to Central America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered with tiny, hollow, hair-like structures that release irritants when touched.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Diplazium urticifolium.</p>
