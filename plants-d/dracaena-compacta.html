                    <h1>Dracaena compacta</h1>
<p>Dracaena compacta, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a neat and compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and resilience, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and small spaces.</p>
