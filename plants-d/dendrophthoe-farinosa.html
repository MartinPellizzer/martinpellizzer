                    <h1>Dendrophthoe farinosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe farinosa, commonly known as the Indian milkweed or silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is notable for its ability to absorb water and nutrients from its host, which allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
