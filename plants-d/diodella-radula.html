                    <h1>Diodella radula</h1>
<p>Diodella radula, commonly known as the red sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Hexacanthida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red coloration and a central oral disc surrounded by long, slender tentacles. The organism lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, attaching itself to substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its diet consists mainly of small planktonic organisms, which it captures using its nematocyst-equipped tentacles.</p>
<p>Diodella radula plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger marine animals.</p>
