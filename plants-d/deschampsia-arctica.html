<p>Deschampsia arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Deschampsia arctica plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic fauna.</p>
