                    <h1>Diuris × fastidiosa</h1>
<p>Diuris × fastidiosa, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diuris corynophora and Diuris tuberculata.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit and features intricate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flower spikes, each with multiple flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated by horticulturists and conservationists.</p>
