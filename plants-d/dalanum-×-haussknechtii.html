                    <h1>Dalanum × haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Dalanum × haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Dalanum officinale and Dalanum pumilum, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it displays genetic variability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
