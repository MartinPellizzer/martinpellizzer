                    <h1>Dryopteris dentata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dentata, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a serrated or toothed edge, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
