<p>Diplazium cuneipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant within its habitat.</p>
<p>Diplazium cuneipinnulum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
