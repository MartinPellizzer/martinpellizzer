                    <h1>Desmodium cephalotoides</h1>
<p>Desmodium cephalotoides, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
