                    <h1>Dryopteris cyatheifolia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris cyatheifolia, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk that resembles a tree, covered with a fibrous, brownish outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, glossy green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex, branching structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
