<p>Deschampsia looseriana, commonly known as the Looser's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its slender, erect stems and low-growing habit make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Deschampsia looseriana is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
