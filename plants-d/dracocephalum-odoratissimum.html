<p>Dracocephalum odoratissimum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dracocephalum odoratissimum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
