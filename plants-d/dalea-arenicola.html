<p>Dalea arenicola, commonly known as sand dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dalea arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
