                    <h1>Dendrobium leucochysum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium leucochysum, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green velvety hair. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
