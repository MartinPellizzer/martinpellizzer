                    <h1>Dodonaea viscosa var. galapagensis</h1>
<p>Dodonaea viscosa var. galapagensis, commonly known as the Galápagos screwtree, is a shrub native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the island's arid climate.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widely distributed Dodonaea viscosa but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological traits.</p>
