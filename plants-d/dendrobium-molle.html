                    <h1>Dendrobium molle</h1>
<p>Dendrobium molle, commonly known as the soft dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of soft, velvety tissue.</p>
<p>Dendrobium molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
