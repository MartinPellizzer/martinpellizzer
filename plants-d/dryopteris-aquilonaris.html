                    <h1>Dryopteris aquilonaris</h1>
<p>Dryopteris aquilonaris, commonly known as the northern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, curled appearance when young. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
