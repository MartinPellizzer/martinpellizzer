                    <h1>Danthonia collinita</h1>
<p>Danthonia collinita, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering spikes are slender and spike-like, producing small, pale-green to brownish florets.</p>
<p>Danthonia collinita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
