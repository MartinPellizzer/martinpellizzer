                    <h1>Dryopteris densa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris densa, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, leathery segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
