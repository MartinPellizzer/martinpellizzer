<p>Dryopteris callipteris, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as cliffs and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
