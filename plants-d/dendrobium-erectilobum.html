<p>Dendrobium erectilobum, commonly known as the upright-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, upright stem with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium erectilobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
