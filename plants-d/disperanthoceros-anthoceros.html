<p>Disperanthoceros anthoceros, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus rather than true leaves or roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are involved in sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
