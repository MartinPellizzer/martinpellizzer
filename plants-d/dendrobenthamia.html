                    <h1>Dendrobenthamia</h1>
<p>Dendrobenthamia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated stems that often hang from trees, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Dendrobenthamia is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
