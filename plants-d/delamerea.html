                    <h1>Delamerea</h1>
<p>Delamerea, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Delamerea is notable for its ability to trap and float on water, which aids in its dispersal.</p>
