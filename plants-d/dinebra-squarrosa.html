                    <h1>Dinebra squarrosa</h1>
<p>Dinebra squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-adapted to semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Dinebra squarrosa is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
