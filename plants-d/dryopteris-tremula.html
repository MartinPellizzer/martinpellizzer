<p>Dryopteris tremula, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern temperate regions of the world.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as appearing "brittle" due to their fragile texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Dryopteris tremula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
