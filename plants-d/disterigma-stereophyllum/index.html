                            <h1>Disterigma Stereophyllum</h1>
<p>Blue-eyed grass, scientifically known as Disterigma stereophyllum, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. Its name derives from the vivid blue petals that resemble eyes, surrounded by a cluster of white stamens that give it a unique and captivating appearance. This species thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found growing in open landscapes where it adds a splash of color to the desert environment. Despite its delicate look, the blue-eyed grass is remarkably resilient, adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water. It is not only a symbol of the African savanna but also a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
