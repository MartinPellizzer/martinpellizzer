                    <h1>Delphinium shawurense</h1>
<p>Delphinium shawurense, commonly known as the Shawuren larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Delphinium shawurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that can support its specific growing conditions.</p>
