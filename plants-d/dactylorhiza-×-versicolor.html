<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem.</p>
