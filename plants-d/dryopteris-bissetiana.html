<p>Dryopteris bissetiana, commonly known as the Bisset's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow outline. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and short, supporting the growth of its upright, arching fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
