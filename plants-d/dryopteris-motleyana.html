                    <h1>Dryopteris motleyana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris motleyana, commonly known as the Motley wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
