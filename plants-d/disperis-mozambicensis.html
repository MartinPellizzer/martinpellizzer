<p>Disperis mozambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique Disperis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly Mozambique.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, fragrant blooms are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
