                    <h1>Doellingeria umbellata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Doellingeria umbellata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
