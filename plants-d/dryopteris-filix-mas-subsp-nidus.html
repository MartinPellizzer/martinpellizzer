<p>Dryopteris filix-mas subsp.</p>
<p>nidus, commonly known as the basket fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
