                    <h1>Dichostylis squarrosa</h1>
<p>Dichostylis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose dichostylis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows as a perennial herb with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, a characteristic known as dioecious reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Dichostylis squarrosa is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
