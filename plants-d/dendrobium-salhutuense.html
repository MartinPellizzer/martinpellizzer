<p>Dendrobium salhutuense, commonly known as the Salhutu orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Dendrobium salhutuense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
