<p>Davallia biflora, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that resemble the feet of a hare, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
