<p>Daphnidium gracile, commonly known as the slender water flea, is a small freshwater crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its transparent, elongated body and the presence of a carapace that covers most of its body. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Daphnidium gracile plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary consumer, feeding on algae and detritus.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes a dormant stage called a ephippium, which allows it to survive harsh environmental conditions.</p>
