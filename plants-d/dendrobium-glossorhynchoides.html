                    <h1>Dendrobium glossorhynchoides</h1>
<p>Dendrobium glossorhynchoides, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive lip that is often orange or red.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
