<p>Dryopteris invisa, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense network of roots that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
