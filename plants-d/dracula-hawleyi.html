                    <h1>Dracula hawleyi</h1>
<p>Dracula hawleyi, commonly known as the Hawley's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often red or purple-pink petals that resemble the wings of a bat, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in late winter or early spring. Dracula hawleyi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
