<p>Diplazium taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Diplazium taquetii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
