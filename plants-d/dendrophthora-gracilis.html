                    <h1>Dendrophthora gracilis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora gracilis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on the host's branches.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora gracilis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the structural complexity of the canopy.</p>
