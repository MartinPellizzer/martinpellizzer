                    <h1>Desmodium orbiculare</h1>
<p>Desmodium orbiculare, commonly known as the globular burr vetch, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive globular seed pods that enclose the seeds, which are often used as a natural burr for attaching to animal fur. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
