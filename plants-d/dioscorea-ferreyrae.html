<p>Dioscorea ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family, native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are its primary economic and medicinal value. Its tubers are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
