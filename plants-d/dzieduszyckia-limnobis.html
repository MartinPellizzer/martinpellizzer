                    <h1>Dzieduszyckia limnobis</h1>
<p>Dzieduszyckia limnobis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Dzieduszyckia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Poland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and pond margins. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Dzieduszyckia limnobis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
