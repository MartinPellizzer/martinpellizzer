                    <h1>Dryopteris × benedictii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × benedictii, commonly known as the Benedict's wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often bi-colored fronds that display a striking combination of green and brown hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds typically unfurl in a compact, curled manner before spreading out, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
