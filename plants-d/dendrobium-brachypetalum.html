                    <h1>Dendrobium brachypetalum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium brachypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive narrow petal shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Dendrobium brachypetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
