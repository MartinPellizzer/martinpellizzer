                    <h1>Deschampsia borealis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia borealis, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, hair-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing the soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Deschampsia borealis plays a crucial role in providing habitat and forage for arctic wildlife.</p>
