<p>Dipterygia, commonly known as the "sicklepod" or "bittercress," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, cruciform flowers and their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Dipterygia species typically have alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The fruits are dry pods that split open to release the seeds, a feature common in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>They are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
