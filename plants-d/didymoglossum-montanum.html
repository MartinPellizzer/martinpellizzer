                <h1>Didymoglossum montanum</h1>
<p>Didymoglossum montanum, commonly known as the mountain moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, firm leaves that are often curved at the tips. This species is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions in mountain ecosystems.</p>
