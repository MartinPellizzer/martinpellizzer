<p>Diploscyphus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, carpet-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its closely spaced, star-shaped thallus that gives it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus.</p>
<p>Diploscyphus mexicanus is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of the understory vegetation in humid ecosystems.</p>
