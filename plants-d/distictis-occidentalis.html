<p>Distictis occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Distictis, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Distictis occidentalis is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
