<p>Diarthron arenarium, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order.</p>
<p>It is a photobiont lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky surfaces or sandy soils. Its structure consists of a crustose thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate.</p>
<p>Diarthron arenarium plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for dry, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
