<p>Dactylorchis maculata var. traunsteineriifolius, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's spotted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with a single, fleshy pseudobulb that supports a few narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
