<p>Dubyaea cymiformis, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It blooms during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Dubyaea cymiformis is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
