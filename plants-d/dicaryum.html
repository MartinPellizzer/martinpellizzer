                    <h1>Dicaryum</h1>
<p>Dicaryum, commonly known as the "double-fruit" or "two-seed plant," is a unique botanical structure found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It refers to a type of fruit that contains two seeds, often arranged in a symmetrical pattern within the ovary. This structure is typically associated with specific genera within the Rutaceae family, such as Ziziphus. The development of dicaryum involves the fusion of two ovules, each contributing to the formation of a separate seed.</p>
<p>This characteristic is not only a taxonomic marker but also reflects the plant's reproductive strategy and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
