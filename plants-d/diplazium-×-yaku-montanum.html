                    <h1>Diplazium × yaku-montanum</h1>
<p>Diplazium × yaku-montanum, commonly known as the Yaku-Montanum fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium yakuense and Diplazium montanum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compound fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Diplazium × yaku-montanum make it a notable species in the study of fern hybridization and ecological adaptation.</p>
