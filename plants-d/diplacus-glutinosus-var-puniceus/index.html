                            <h1>Diplacus Glutinosus Var. Puniceus</h1>
<p>Diplacus glutinosus var. puniceus is a strikingly beautiful plant known for its vibrant red flowers and unique foliage. Native to the western United States, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, making it a favorite among horticulturists and gardeners. This variant of the common whipplow is distinguished by its intense pink to red blooms that appear in late spring. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in both wild and cultivated landscapes. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to avoid overwatering and to ensure it receives adequate sunlight.</p>
