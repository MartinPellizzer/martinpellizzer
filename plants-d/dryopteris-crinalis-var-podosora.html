                    <h1>Dryopteris crinalis var. podosora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris crinalis var. podosora, commonly known as the rock fern or Christmas fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with dark green, leathery leaves that remain upright even after frost. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
