                    <h1>Dichelachne micrantha var. setifolia</h1>
<p>Dichelachne micrantha var. setifolia, commonly known as slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
