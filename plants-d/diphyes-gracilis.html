                    <h1>Diphyes gracilis</h1>
<p>Diphyes gracilis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its ability to form dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes both a seedling stage and a mature, parasitic stage.</p>
