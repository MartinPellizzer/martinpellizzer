                    <h1>Draba alpina var. major</h1>
<p>Draba alpina var. major, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This variety is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Draba alpina. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
