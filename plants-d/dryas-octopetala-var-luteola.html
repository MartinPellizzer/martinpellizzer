<p>Dryas octopetala var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
