                    <h1>Dendrobium cochliodes</h1>
<p>Dendrobium cochliodes, commonly known as the orchid with the coral-like flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, coral-red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure.</p>
