                    <h1>Dendrobium bracteosum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium bracteosum, commonly known as the bracteate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive bract-like structure at the base of the inflorescence.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bracteosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
