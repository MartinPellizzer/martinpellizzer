                    <h1>Dryopteris liliana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris liliana, commonly known as the Lilian's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in spherical, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
