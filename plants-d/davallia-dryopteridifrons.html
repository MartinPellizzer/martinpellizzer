<p>Davallia dryopteridifrons, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative means.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
