<p>Dasylirion palaciosii, commonly known as the Palacios's sotol, is a species of flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
