<p>Diasperus symphoricarpodes, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, palmate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
