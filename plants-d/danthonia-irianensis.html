                    <h1>Danthonia irianensis</h1>
<p>Danthonia irianensis, commonly known as the Irian Island grass, is a species of grass native to the island of Irian Jaya (now known as Papua) in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in a variety of wetland environments.</p>
<p>Danthonia irianensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
