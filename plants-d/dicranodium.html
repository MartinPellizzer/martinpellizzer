                    <h1>Dicranodium</h1>
<p>Dicranodium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Dicranodium species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, called strobila, produce spores and are an important feature of their life cycle.</p>
