                    <h1>Drosera graomogolensis</h1>
<p>Drosera graomogolensis, commonly known as the Graomogol Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and has small, rosette-like leaves that form a dense mat. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>Drosera graomogolensis is a rare species, with limited documented populations and specific ecological requirements.</p>
