                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sheep's fescue, is a variant of the common sheep's fescue, characterized by its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This plant produces viviparous seedlings, meaning the embryos develop while still enclosed within the seed coat, allowing for rapid germination once the seed is dispersed. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and meadows. The plant has a tufted growth habit with dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and grassland restoration efforts.</p>
