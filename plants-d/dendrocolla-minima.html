                    <h1>Dendrocolla minima</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla minima, commonly known as the small tree fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant grows slowly and is often found in shaded, moist environments where it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its small size and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
