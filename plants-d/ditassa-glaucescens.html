<p>Ditassa glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
