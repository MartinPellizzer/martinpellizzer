<p>Dactylorhiza aristata var. kodiakensis, commonly known as the Kodiak orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Alaskan panhandle.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships that aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
