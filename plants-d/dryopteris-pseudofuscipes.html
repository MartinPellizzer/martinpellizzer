                    <h1>Dryopteris pseudofuscipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pseudofuscipes, commonly known as the dark-furred wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate, compound leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
