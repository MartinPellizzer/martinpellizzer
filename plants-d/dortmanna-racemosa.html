                    <h1>Dortmanna racemosa</h1>
<p>Dortmanna racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water resistance.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a raceme, which is a key feature in its common name.</p>
