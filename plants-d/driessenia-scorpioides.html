<p>Driessenia scorpioides, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 10 cm in length. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Driessenia scorpioides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
