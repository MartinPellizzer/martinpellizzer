                    <h1>Drymonia belizensis</h1>
<p>Drymonia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize drymonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle aromatic scent. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a smooth texture and a waxy appearance, adapting to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
