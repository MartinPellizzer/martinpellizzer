                    <h1>Dendrobium pseudoaloifolium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium pseudoaloifolium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific host trees for support. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
