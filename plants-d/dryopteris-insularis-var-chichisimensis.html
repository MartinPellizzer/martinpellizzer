                    <h1>Dryopteris insularis var. chichisimensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris insularis var. chichisimensis, commonly known as the Chichisima fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Chichisima in the Gal√°pagos Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
