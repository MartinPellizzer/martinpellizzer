<p>Delphinium elatum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>gremblichii, commonly known as the Gremblich's larkspur, is a hybrid subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typical of the Delphinium genus, with five sepals that are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that distinguish it from its parent species.</p>
