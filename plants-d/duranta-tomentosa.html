<p>Duranta tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of tubular, blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans and domesticated livestock. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Duranta tomentosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
