                    <h1>Dryopteris erythrosora var. viridisora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris erythrosora var. viridisora, commonly known as the Green Shield Fern, is a variant of the Red Shield Fern characterized by its lush, emerald-green fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate leaves. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on the color and texture of its fronds compared to the typical variety.</p>
