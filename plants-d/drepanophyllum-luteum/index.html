                            <h1>Drepanophyllum Luteum</h1>
<p>Drepanophyllum luteum is a rare and fascinating plant known for its striking yellow flowers and unique growth habits. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This member of the Rubiaceae family is often found in dense forests, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Its delicate appearance belies its resilience, making it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival.</p>
