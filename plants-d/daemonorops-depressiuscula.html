<p>Daemonorops depressiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf pandan, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones rather than flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
