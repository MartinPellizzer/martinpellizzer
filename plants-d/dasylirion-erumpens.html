<p>It features a rosette of thick, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in sharp spines, providing both protection and water conservation. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, white to pale purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its fibrous leaves are used for thatching and as a source of fiber, while the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Dasylirion erumpens is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
