<p>Digraphis arundinacea f. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a variant of the common reed characterized by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of water bodies. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often greenish or reddish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other reed species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth form.</p>
