<p>Didymoglossum bilabiatum, commonly known as the two-lipped moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafy shoots and the presence of two distinct lobes on its leaves, giving it its common name. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on specialized stems called setae.</p>
