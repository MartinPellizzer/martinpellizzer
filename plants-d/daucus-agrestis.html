                    <h1>Daucus agrestis</h1>
<p>Daucus agrestis, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble lace. Daucus agrestis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
<p>It is also known for its edible roots, though they are usually less palatable than those of the cultivated carrot.</p>
