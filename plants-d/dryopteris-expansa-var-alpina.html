                    <h1>Dryopteris expansa var. alpina</h1>
<p>Dryopteris expansa var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Wood Fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
