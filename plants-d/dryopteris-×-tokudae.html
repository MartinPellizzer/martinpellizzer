                    <h1>Dryopteris × tokudae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × tokudae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris japonica.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface, and the spore-producing structures are borne on the underside of the leaves.</p>
