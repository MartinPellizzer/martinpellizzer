                <h1>Digitorebutia brachyantha</h1>
<p>Digitorebutia brachyantha, commonly known as the desert rose or desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring thick, woody stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Digitorebutia brachyantha is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry landscapes.</p>
