                    <h1>Dendrophylax lindenii</h1>
<p>Dendrophylax lindenii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of pine rocklands and hardwood hammocks, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are white or pale pink and emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
