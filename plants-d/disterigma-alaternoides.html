                    <h1>Disterigma alaternoides</h1>
<p>Disterigma alaternoides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that are often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is toxic and has been used traditionally for various purposes, though it requires caution.</p>
<p>Disterigma alaternoides is well adapted to dry environments and can thrive in rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
