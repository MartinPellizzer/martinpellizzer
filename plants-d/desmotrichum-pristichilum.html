<p>Desmotrichum pristichilum, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from September to November. The plant's leaves are succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
