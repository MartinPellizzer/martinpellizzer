<p>Dichaetanthera trichopoda, commonly known as the woolly anther grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Dichaetanthera trichopoda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
