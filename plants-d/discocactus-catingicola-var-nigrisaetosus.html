<p>Discocactus catingicola var. nigrisaetosus, commonly known as the black-spined discocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical to cylindrical stem, which is often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its dark, almost black spines, which give it its unique appearance.</p>
