                    <h1>Disperis kilimanjarica</h1>
<p>Disperis kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</p>
<p>This orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of the mountain's summit, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded crevices. The plant has small, strap-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and environmental threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
