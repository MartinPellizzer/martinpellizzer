                    <h1>Deyeuxia sylvatica var. borealis</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia sylvatica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold and waterlogged conditions, making it a key component of boreal and temperate wetlands.</p>
