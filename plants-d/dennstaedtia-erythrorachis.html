                    <h1>Dennstaedtia erythrorachis</h1>
<p>Dennstaedtia erythrorachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often tinged with red, particularly along the veins. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
