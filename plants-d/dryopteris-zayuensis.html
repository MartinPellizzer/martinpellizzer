                    <h1>Dryopteris zayuensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests at high altitudes. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
