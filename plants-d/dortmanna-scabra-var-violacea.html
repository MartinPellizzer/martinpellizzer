                    <h1>Dortmanna scabra var. violacea</h1>
<p>Dortmanna scabra var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form of Dortmanna scabra and is often found in still or slow-moving water.</p>
