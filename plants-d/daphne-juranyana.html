                    <h1>Daphne juranyana</h1>
<p>Daphne juranyana, commonly known as the yellow daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in gardens.</p>
