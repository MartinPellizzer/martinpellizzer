                    <h1>Dryopteris × cebennae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × cebennae, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomeris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, featuring a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can access the high humidity it requires. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's robust growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates.</p>
