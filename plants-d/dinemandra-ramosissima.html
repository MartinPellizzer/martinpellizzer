<p>Dinemandra ramosissima, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they are edible but have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
