<p>Diplycosia bartolomei, commonly known as the Bartolomei's diplycosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
