<p>Dryopteris wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus.</p>
<p>Dryopteris wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
