<p>Desideria stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Desideria stewartii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
