                    <h1>Drosera closterostigma</h1>
<p>Drosera closterostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish hue, which helps in photosynthesis and attracts prey.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured insects.</p>
