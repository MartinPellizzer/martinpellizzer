                    <h1>Dorstenia caimitensis</h1>
<p>Dorstenia caimitensis, commonly known as the "caimito" or "bottle tree," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, a feature adapted to its arid and semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within the leaf axils, and it bears edible fruits that are yellow when ripe. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dorstenia caimitensis is valued not only for its ecological role but also for its traditional use in local cuisines and medicine.</p>
