<p>Dendrobenthamia ferruginea var. jinyunensis, commonly known as the Jinyun orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on trees in mountainous regions. Its leaves are革质 (leathery) and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
