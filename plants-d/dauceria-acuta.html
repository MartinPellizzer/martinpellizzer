<p>Dauceria acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and umbel-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, serrated leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Dauceria acuta is known for its potentially toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and phototoxic reactions upon exposure to sunlight.</p>
