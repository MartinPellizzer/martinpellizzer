                    <h1>Decalobanthus</h1>
<p>Decalobanthus, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or ovate, and they produce yellow or white flowers in composite flower heads. Decalobanthus species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and they have a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and the absence of a true stem, which distinguishes them from true dandelions.</p>
