                    <h1>Daphnopsis loranthifolia</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis loranthifolia, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and are usually covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
