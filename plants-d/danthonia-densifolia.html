                    <h1>Danthonia densifolia</h1>
<p>Danthonia densifolia, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Danthonia densifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
