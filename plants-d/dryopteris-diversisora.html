                    <h1>Dryopteris diversisora</h1>
<p>Dryopteris diversisora, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, often irregular pattern of pinnae that vary in size and shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters known as indusia.</p>
