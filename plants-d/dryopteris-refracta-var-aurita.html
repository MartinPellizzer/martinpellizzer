                    <h1>Dryopteris refracta var. aurita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris refracta var. aurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow spore cases that contrast with its dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting spore dispersers.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
