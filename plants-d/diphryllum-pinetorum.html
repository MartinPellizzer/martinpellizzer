                    <h1>Diphryllum pinetorum</h1>
<p>Diphryllum pinetorum, commonly known as the pine-leaf siphonous plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Diphylleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unusual morphology, featuring a single, large, undivided leaf that resembles a pine needle. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in association with other plants in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive structure and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
