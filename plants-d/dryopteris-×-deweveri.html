                    <h1>Dryopteris × deweveri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × deweveri, commonly known as the Dewever's shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which develop into fertile fronds by summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
