                    <h1>Dacrydium pectinatum var. robustum</h1>
<p>Dacrydium pectinatum var. robustum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Podocarpaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a tall, evergreen tree with a distinctive, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, fibrous leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the leaves and female cones located at the tips. Its leaves are long, strap-shaped, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is native to New Zealand and is adapted to temperate rainforest conditions.</p>
