                    <h1>Dendrophthoe leucostachys</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, silky hair.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe leucostachys is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
