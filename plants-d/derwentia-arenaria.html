                    <h1>Derwentia arenaria</h1>
<p>Derwentia arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune fern, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Derwentia arenaria is an important indicator species for coastal habitats and is often used in ecological studies.</p>
