The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate orchid-like blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
