                    <h1>Deyeuxia trichodonta</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia trichodonta, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its specific epithet *trichodonta*, meaning "hairy teeth.".</p>
<p>Deyeuxia trichodonta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
