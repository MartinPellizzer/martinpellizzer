<p>Dendrosenecio kilimanjari subsp.</p>
<p>cottonii, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro tree heath, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for rocky and exposed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
