<p>Droguetia umbricola, commonly known as the shadow droguetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.
