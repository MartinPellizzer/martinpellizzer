<p>Daphniphyllopsis capitata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Daphniophyllopsidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped fronds that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant exhibits a primitive structure with a short, stout rhizome and delicate, spirally arranged leaves. It is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Daphniphyllopsis capitata is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
