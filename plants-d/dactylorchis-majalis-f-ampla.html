                    <h1>Dactylorchis majalis f. ampla</h1>
<p>Dactylorchis majalis f. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy rhizome and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
