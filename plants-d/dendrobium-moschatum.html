                    <h1>Dendrobium moschatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium moschatum, commonly known as the orchid of the gods, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, honey-like scent. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Dendrobium moschatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique fragrance.</p>
