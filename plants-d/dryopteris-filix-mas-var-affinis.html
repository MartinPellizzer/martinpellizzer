                    <h1>Dryopteris filix-mas var. affinis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris filix-mas var. affinis, commonly known as the European male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered at the base of the fronds and contribute to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage.</p>
