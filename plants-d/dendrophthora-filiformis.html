                    <h1>Dendrophthora filiformis</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora filiformis, commonly known as the slender coralwood, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on tree bark for support rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in the canopy layers of dense forests.</p>
