                    <h1>Danais masoalana</h1>
<p>Danais masoalana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Danais masoalana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
