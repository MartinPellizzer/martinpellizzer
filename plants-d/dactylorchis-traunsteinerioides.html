The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
