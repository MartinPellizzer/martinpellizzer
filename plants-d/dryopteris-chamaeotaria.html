                    <h1>Dryopteris chamaeotaria</h1>
<p>Dryopteris chamaeotaria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
