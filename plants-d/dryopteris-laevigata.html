                    <h1>Dryopteris laevigata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris laevigata, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
