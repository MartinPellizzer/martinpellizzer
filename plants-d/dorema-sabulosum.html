                    <h1>Dorema sabulosum</h1>
<p>Dorema sabulosum, commonly known as the sand dune plant or desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Dorema sabulosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
