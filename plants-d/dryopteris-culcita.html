                    <h1>Dryopteris culcita</h1>
<p>Dryopteris culcita, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
