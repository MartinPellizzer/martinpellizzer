<p>Davallia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more rigid than the sterile ones.</p>
