<p>Dryopteris velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in a fine, velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
