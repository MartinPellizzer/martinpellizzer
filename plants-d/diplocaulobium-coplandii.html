                    <h1>Diplocaulobium coplandii</h1>
<p>Diplocaulobium coplandii, commonly known as the Copland's diplocaulobium, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
