                    <h1>Doryopteris pedata f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Doryopteris pedata f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and growth habits.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a compact, upright growth form that allows it to thrive in rocky or cliff habitats. This fern exhibits a glabrous (smooth) texture on its leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Doryopteris.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and adaptation to specific ecological niches.</p>
