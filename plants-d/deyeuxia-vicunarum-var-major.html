<p>Deyeuxia vicunarum var. major, commonly known as the large spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
