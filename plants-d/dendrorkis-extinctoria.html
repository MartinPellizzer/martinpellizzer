                    <h1>Dendrorkis extinctoria</h1>
<p>Dendrorkis extinctoria, commonly known as the flameleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-colored foliage and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
