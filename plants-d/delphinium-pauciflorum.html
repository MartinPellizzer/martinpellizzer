<p>Delphinium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of alternate, palmately compound leaves, and it produces small, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Delphinium pauciflorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.</p>
