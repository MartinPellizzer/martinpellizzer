                    <h1>Dicksonia millefolium</h1>
<p>Dicksonia millefolium, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
