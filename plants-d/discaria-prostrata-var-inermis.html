<p>Discaria prostrata var. inermis, commonly known as the silky dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion puffs. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a silvery-blue hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions.</p>
