                    <h1>Dictyoneura sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Dictyoneura sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive spherical or oval-shaped fruit that turns red when mature, which is adapted for bird dispersal. The plant possesses a short stem and a dense, leafy crown, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
