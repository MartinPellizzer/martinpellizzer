<p>Dendrobium trichostomum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrobium trichostomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
