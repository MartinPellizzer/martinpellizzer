                    <h1>Dicorynia guianensis</h1>
<p>Dicorynia guianensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its buttressed roots that provide stability in the nutrient-poor soil. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain multiple seeds, each encased in a hard shell. These seeds are the edible Brazil nuts, which are commercially valuable.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
