                    <h1>Diplodiscus aureus</h1>
<p>Diplodiscus aureus, commonly known as the golden disc fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a disc-like structure, which helps it thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant's leaves are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often associated with muddy or nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Diplodiscus aureus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
