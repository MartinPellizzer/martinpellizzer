                    <h1>Drosera aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Drosera aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-tipped sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually red or pink in color, with a distinctive red tip that helps in attracting prey.</p>
<p>Drosera aurantiaca is a low-growing plant, often forming dense clusters that help it thrive in its specialized habitat.</p>
