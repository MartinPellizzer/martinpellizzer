                    <h1>Dryopteris rubiformis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris rubiformis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking contrast of dark green and red veins. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
