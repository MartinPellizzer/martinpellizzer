                    <h1>Decaspora gunnii</h1>
<p>Decaspora gunnii, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in extreme environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern hemisphere, particularly in Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions, where it grows on rocky substrates and in coastal areas. The plant has a compact morphology with short, dense stems and leaf-like structures that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. Its ability to survive in cold, dry conditions is attributed to its specialized physiological adaptations, including the production of antifreeze compounds.</p>
<p>Decaspora gunnii plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its harsh environment.</p>
