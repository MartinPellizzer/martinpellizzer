                            <h1>Dupontia Pelligera</h1>
<p>Dupontia pelligera is a unique plant species known for its striking appearance and rare habitat. It thrives in specific coastal environments, often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds. This plant has adapted to harsh conditions, developing specialized structures to retain moisture and withstand erosion. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in arid climates. Despite its resilience, Dupontia pelligera remains a subject of interest for botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
