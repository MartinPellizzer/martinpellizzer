                    <h1>Dryopteris dumetorum</h1>
<p>Dryopteris dumetorum, commonly known as the wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
