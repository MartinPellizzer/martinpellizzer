                    <h1>Dryopteris sublacera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris sublacera, commonly known as the rock fern or slender woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a pale, almost silvery underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, allowing it to spread effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, round sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
