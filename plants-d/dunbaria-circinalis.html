<p>Dunbaria circinalis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and革质, providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dunbaria circinalis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
