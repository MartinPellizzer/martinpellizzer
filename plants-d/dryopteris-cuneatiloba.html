                    <h1>Dryopteris cuneatiloba</h1>
<p>Dryopteris cuneatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with narrow, elongated lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous cover called a indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
