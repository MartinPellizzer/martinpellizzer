<p>Dryopteris canadasii, commonly known as the Canadian lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30â€“90 cm long, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are edible when young and tender. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are dark green and turn a bronze color in the fall before dying back.</p>
