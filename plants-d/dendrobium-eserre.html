<p>Dendrobium eserre, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow lip and white petals, which bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium eserre is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
