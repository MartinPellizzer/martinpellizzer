                    <h1>Dendrophthora rotundata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora rotundata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
