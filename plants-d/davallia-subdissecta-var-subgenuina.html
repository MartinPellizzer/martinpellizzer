                    <h1>Davallia subdissecta var. subgenuina</h1>
<p>Davallia subdissecta var. subgenuina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form a dense network, allowing it to cling to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage is evergreen, with a unique appearance that resembles a cluster of tiny, feather-like leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
