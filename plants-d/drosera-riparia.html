<p>Drosera riparia, commonly known as the river sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its slender, branching stems can reach up to 30 cm in height. The flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>Drosera riparia is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
