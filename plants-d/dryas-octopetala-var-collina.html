                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. collina</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. collina, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth and specific habitat preferences.</p>
