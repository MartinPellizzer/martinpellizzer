<p>Diplazium pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
