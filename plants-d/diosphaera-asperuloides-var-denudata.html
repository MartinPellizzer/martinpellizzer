<p>Diosphaera asperuloides var. denudata, commonly known as the naked diosphaera, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
