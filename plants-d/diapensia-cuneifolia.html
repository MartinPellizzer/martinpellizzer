                    <h1>Diapensia cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Diapensia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf diapensia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Diapensia cuneifolia produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
