                    <h1>Dryopteris × vidae</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × vidae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable offspring and is typically propagated through division of the rhizomes.</p>
