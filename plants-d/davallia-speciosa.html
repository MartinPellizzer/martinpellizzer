                    <h1>Davallia speciosa</h1>
<p>Davallia speciosa, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided appearance that resembles the plumes of a peacock's tail. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like colonies over time.</p>
<p>Davallia speciosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
