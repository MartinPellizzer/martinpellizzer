<p>Dennstaedtia tamandarei, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, bright green leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
