                    <h1>Dendrophthora ferruginea</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora ferruginea, commonly known as the rust fungus of the oak, is a plant-related organism that belongs to the Basidiomycota division.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic fungus that primarily infects oak trees, causing rust-like symptoms on leaves and stems. The plant's life cycle involves the production of spores that spread through wind, leading to the infection of new hosts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests where oak trees are abundant.</p>
<p>The presence of Dendrophthora ferruginea can significantly impact the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
