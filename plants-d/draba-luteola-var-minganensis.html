                    <h1>Draba luteola var. minganensis</h1>
<p>Draba luteola var. minganensis, commonly known as the Mingan yellow rocket, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the rocky habitats of the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec, Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and specialized adaptations for nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in open, sun-exposed areas, often on limestone or granitic substrates. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
