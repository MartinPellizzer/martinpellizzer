                    <h1>Dasurus</h1>
<p>Dasurus, commonly known as the honey badger, is a member of the weasel family and is native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, stocky mammal with a thick, coarse coat that can vary in color from brown to black. The plant named Dasurus does not exist; it is likely a confusion with the animal. Please verify the name of the plant you are referring to.</p>
