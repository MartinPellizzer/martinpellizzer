                    <h1>Dryopteris euryphylla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with prominent sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, turning bronze in the fall before shedding, which contributes to its seasonal aesthetic in natural habitats.</p>
