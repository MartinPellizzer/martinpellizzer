<p>Doona, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Schlumbergera and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, orange, and white, typically during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Doona is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
