                    <h1>Dactylorhiza maculata f. angustiflora</h1>
<p>Dactylorhiza maculata f. angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers with a distinctive dark purple or brown marking on the lip. This orchid thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and peat bogs, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. Its growth is highly dependent on specific environmental conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soft substrates.</p>
