                    <h1>Draconanthes aberrans</h1>
<p>Draconanthes aberrans, commonly known as the dragon's breath fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble the flick of a dragon's tail, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and colonize shaded, moist environments. Its spores are released in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in compact, cone-like formations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Draconanthes aberrans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
