                    <h1>Desmodium nepalense</h1>
<p>Desmodium nepalense, commonly known as the Himalayan sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that are curved and resemble a sickle, hence its common name. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Desmodium nepalense plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
