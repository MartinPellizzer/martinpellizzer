                    <h1>Dulcamara flexuosa</h1>
<p>Dulcamara flexuosa, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves and berries.</p>
