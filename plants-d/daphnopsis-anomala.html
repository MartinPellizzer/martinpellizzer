                    <h1>Daphnopsis anomala</h1>
<p>Daphnopsis anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
