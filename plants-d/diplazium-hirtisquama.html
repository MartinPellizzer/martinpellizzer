                    <h1>Diplazium hirtisquama</h1>
<p>Diplazium hirtisquama, commonly known as the hairy-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in small, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it anchors itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Diplazium hirtisquama plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
