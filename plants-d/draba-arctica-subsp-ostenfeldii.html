<p>Draba arctica subsp.</p>
<p>ostenfeldii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
