<p>Draba fladnizensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser fladnizen's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Draba fladnizensis.</p>
