                    <h1>Dryopteris erythrosora var. dilatata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris erythrosora var. dilatata, commonly known as the red fern, is a variant of the marginal wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown fronds that often feature a striking contrast against the darker green of the central veins. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young.</p>
<p>It produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusium, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
