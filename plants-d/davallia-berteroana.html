<p>Davallia berteroana, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces new plantlets, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a rough, textured surface that helps it retain moisture.</p>
