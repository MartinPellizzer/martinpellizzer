                    <h1>Dracaena oculta</h1>
<p>Dracaena oculta, commonly known as the hidden dragon tree, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the remote regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are not typically consumed by humans. Dracaena oculta is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a unique addition to indoor gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
