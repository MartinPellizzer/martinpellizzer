                    <h1>Dryas octopetala var. oxyodonta</h1>
<p>Dryas octopetala var. oxyodonta, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster of eight, giving it the species name "octopetala.". It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra.</p>
<p>Its botanical adaptations make it well-suited for cold, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
