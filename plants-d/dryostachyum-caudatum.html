<p>Dryostachyum caudatum, commonly known as the panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, branching panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Dryostachyum caudatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
