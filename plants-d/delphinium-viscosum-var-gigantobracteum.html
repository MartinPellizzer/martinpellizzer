<p>Delphinium viscosum var. gigantobracteum, commonly known as the giant bract delphinium, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spires of flowers, which are clustered in dense racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a sticky surface, giving the plant its species name "viscosum.".</p>
<p>The large, leaf-like bracts that enclose the flower cluster are a distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
