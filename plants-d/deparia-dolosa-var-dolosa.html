                    <h1>Deparia dolosa var. dolosa</h1>
<p>Deparia dolosa var. dolosa, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Deparia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage, which helps in water retention and protection from pathogens.</p>
