                    <h1>Delissea kipahuluensis</h1>
<p>Delissea kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists studying Hawaiian flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
