<p>Dimorphanthera kempteriana, commonly known as the Kempter's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with showy petals and sepals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
