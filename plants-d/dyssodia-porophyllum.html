<p>Dyssodia porophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
