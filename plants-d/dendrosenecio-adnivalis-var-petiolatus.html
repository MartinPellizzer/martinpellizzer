                    <h1>Dendrosenecio adnivalis var. petiolatus</h1>
<p>Dendrosenecio adnivalis var. petiolatus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle contrast to its textured foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid and cold environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf stalks, which give it a unique appearance among its relatives.</p>
