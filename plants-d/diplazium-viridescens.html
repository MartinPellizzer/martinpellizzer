<p>Diplazium viridescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
