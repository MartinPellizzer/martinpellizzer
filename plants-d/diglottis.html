                    <h1>Diglottis</h1>
<p>Diglottis, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a type of fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
