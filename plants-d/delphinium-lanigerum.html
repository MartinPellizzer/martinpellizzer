<p>Delphinium lanigerum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Delphinium lanigerum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its presence of alkaloids.</p>
