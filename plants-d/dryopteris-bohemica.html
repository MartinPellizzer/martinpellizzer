<p>Dryopteris bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The Bohemian wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
