<p>Dicyrta candida, commonly known as the white sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, translucent, and ribbon-like fronds that are typically light green to white in color. This algae thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Dicyrta candida plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important indicator of water quality in coastal areas.</p>
