<p>Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp.</p>
<p>gervasiana, commonly known as the Gervasa's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as peatlands and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single spike of pale to deep purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like structures at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution.</p>
