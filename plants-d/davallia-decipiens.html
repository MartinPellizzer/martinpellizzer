                    <h1>Davallia decipiens</h1>
<p>Davallia decipiens, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous roots and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Davallia decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
