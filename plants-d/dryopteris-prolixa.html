                    <h1>Dryopteris prolixa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris prolixa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
