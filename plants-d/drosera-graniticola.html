<p>Drosera graniticola, commonly known as the granite sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the quartz and granite outcrops of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects.

Its small, white flowers are arranged in a dense inflorescence and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it a resilient and unique example of a carnivorous plant.</p>
