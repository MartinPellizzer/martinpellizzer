                    <h1>Desmodium illinoense</h1>
<p>Desmodium illinoense, commonly known as Illinois ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like structures that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Desmodium illinoense is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
