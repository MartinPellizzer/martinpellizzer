                    <h1>Dryopteris platypus</h1>
<p>Dryopteris platypus, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into a series of pinnae, which are themselves further divided into smaller pinnules. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
