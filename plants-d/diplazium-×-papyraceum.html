                    <h1>Diplazium × papyraceum</h1>
<p>Diplazium × papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium pteropodum, leading to a distinct morphology. The plant features long, slender fronds with a delicate, papery texture, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in shaded, moist environments in tropical regions.</p>
