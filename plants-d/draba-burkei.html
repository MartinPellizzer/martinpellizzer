<p>Draba burkei, commonly known as Burke's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba burkei produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season.</p>
<p>Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
