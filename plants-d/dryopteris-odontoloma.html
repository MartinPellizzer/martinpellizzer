                    <h1>Dryopteris odontoloma</h1>
<p>Dryopteris odontoloma, commonly known as the toothed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with toothed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the environment.</p>
