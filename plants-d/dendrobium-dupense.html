<p>Dendrobium dupense, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium dupense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
