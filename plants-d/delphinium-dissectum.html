                    <h1>Delphinium dissectum</h1>
<p>Delphinium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and dissected, giving the plant its common name, and are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets.</p>
