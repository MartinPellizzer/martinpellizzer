                    <h1>Dasycoleum</h1>
<p>Dasycoleum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Dasycoleum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its foliage for laying eggs.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in moist soils makes it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
