<p>Dryopteris habaensis, commonly known as the Haba fern, is a species of polypod fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in spherical, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
