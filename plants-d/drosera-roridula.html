                    <h1>Drosera roridula</h1>
<p>Drosera roridula, commonly known as the desert sundew, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent leaves. Unlike most sundews, it does not rely on rainwater but instead collects moisture from the air through its specialized leaves.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
