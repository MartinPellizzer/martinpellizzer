<p>Durabaculum sancristobalense, commonly known as the San Crist√≥bal durabaculum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited geographic distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
