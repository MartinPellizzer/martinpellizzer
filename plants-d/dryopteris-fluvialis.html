                    <h1>Dryopteris fluvialis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris fluvialis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or dangling. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
