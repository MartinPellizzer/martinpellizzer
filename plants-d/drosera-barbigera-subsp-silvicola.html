<p>Drosera barbigera subsp.</p>
<p>silvicola, commonly known as the forest sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and forests of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
