                    <h1>Dichanthelium telmatum</h1>
<p>Dichanthelium telmatum, commonly known as the marsh panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and other moist habitats, where it forms dense, clump-like growths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity.</p>
