<p>Dryopteris dilatata subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian wood fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat arching growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its slightly smaller size and more delicate fronds compared to the typical form of D. dilatata.</p>
