<p>[WRONG START] Dactyloptenium pilosum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Dactyloptenium pilosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
