<p>It is characterized by its pale, waxy cap and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fruiting bodies are typically small and resemble ghostly shapes, which contribute to its common name. This species plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by decomposing dead wood.</p>
