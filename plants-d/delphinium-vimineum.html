                    <h1>Delphinium vimineum</h1>
<p>Delphinium vimineum, commonly known as the creeping larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and arranged alternately along the stem. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, moist soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Delphinium vimineum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
