                    <h1>Dryopteris recumbens var. violacea</h1>
<p>Dryopteris recumbens var. violacea, commonly known as the purple shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often display a purplish hue, especially on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
