                    <h1>Delphinium tsarongense var. patentipilum</h1>
<p>Delphinium tsarongense var. patentipilum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is notable for its distinctive, patent-pilose (hairy) leaves and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous climates.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is an important plant in the alpine flora of Central Asia.</p>
