<p>Doryopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Doryopteris intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right growing conditions.</p>
