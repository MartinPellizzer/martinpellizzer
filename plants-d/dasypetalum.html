                    <h1>Dasypetalum</h1>
<p>Dasypetalum, commonly known as the "spurges" or "milkweed," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique floral structures, often featuring cyathium inflorescences, which are cup-like clusters of small flowers. Many species produce a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, a feature that can be both a defense mechanism and a source of chemical compounds. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, with varied shapes depending on the species.</p>
<p>Dasypetalum species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems.</p>
