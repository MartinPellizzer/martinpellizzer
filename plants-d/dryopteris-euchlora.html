<p>Dryopteris euchlora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soil. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its hardy nature and ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces.</p>
