<p>Dissanthelium sclerochloides, commonly known as the hard-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
