                    <h1>Diceros montanus</h1>
<p>Diceros montanus, commonly known as the mountain dik dik, is a small antelope species native to the highland regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped horns and a compact, stocky body adapted to its mountainous habitat. The animal is well-camouflaged in its environment, with a coat that blends with the rocky terrain. It primarily inhabits areas with dense vegetation, where it can find shelter and food.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and hunting, the mountain dik dik is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>
