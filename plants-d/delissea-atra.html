<p>Delissea atra, commonly known as the black delissea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple to almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically a deep violet or purple color, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Delissea atra is considered a threatened species.</p>
