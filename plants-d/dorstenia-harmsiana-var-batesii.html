                    <h1>Dorstenia harmsiana var. batesii</h1>
<p>Dorstenia harmsiana var. batesii, commonly known as the "Bates' False Banana," is a unique member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its striking, curling leaves that resemble the fronds of a banana plant.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it a less showy but ecologically significant species. The plant is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which provide protection in exchange for shelter and food.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
