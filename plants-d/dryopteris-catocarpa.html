<p>Dryopteris catocarpa, commonly known as the red wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
