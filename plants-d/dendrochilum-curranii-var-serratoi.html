<p>Dendrochilum curranii var. serratoi, commonly known as the serrated tree orchid, is a unique species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic. The plant features long, drooping inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
