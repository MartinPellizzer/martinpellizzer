<p>Drymaria cordata subsp.</p>
<p>diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat.</p>
