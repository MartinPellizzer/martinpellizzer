<p>Dactylorhiza × kerneriorum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>ampolai, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features erect, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often being more pronounced.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of hybridization between Dactylorhiza incarnata and Dactylorhiza maculata.</p>
