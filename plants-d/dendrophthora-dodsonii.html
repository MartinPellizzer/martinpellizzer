                    <h1>Dendrophthora dodsonii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora dodsonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for native birds. It is typically found growing on the branches of Metrosideros species, such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and introduced species, Dendrophthora dodsonii is considered endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of Hawaii.</p>
