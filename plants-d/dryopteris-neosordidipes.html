                    <h1>Dryopteris neosordidipes</h1>
<p>Dryopteris neosordidipes, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or reddish-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
