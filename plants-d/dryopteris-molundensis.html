                    <h1>Dryopteris molundensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris molundensis, commonly known as the Molund fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
