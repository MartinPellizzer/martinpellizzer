<p>Dactylorchis incarnata var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and intricate, three-lobed leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers in a loose raceme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This orchid is relatively rare and is often protected due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
