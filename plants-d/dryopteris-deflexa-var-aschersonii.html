<p>Dryopteris deflexa var. aschersonii, commonly known as the Ascherson's holly fern, is a variant of the flexible wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
