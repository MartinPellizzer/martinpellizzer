<p>Dichrotrichum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered dichrotrichum, is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. The flowers are typically tiny and clustered, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same plant, making it monoecious.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
