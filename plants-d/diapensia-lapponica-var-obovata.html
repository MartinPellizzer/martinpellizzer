                    <h1>Diapensia lapponica var. obovata</h1>
<p>Diapensia lapponica var. obovata, commonly known as the Lapland diapensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
