<p>Derris araripensis, commonly known as the Brazilian snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been used in traditional fishing practices.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern agriculture.</p>
