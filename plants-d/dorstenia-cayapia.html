                    <h1>Dorstenia cayapia</h1>
<p>Dorstenia cayapia, commonly known as the Cayapia mountain cucumber, is a member of the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed fruits.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cloud forests at elevations around 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant produces distinctive, cucumber-like fruits that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Dorstenia cayapia is also notable for its ability to climb using tendrils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
