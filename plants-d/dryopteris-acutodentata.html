                    <h1>Dryopteris acutodentata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris acutodentata, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn.</p>
