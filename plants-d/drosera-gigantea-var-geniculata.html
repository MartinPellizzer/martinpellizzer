                    <h1>Drosera gigantea var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Drosera gigantea var. geniculata, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and long, slender leaves that are covered in sticky, glandular hairs. These hairs secrete a viscous liquid that traps insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically blooms with small, yellowish-white flowers in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands or fynbos vegetation.</p>
