                    <h1>Dendrophthora chrysostachya</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora chrysostachya, commonly known as the golden-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora chrysostachya is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded forest environments.</p>
