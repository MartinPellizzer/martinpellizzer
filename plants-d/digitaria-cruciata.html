<p>Digitaria cruciata, commonly known as the crossleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Digitaria cruciata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
