<p>Dipteracanthus canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that have a silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
