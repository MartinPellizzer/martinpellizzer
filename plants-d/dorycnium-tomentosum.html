                    <h1>Dorycnium tomentosum</h1>
<p>Dorycnium tomentosum, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers and small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Dorycnium tomentosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion.</p>
