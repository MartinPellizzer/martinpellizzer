<p>Dactylorhiza incarnata subsp.</p>
<p>sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, peaty soils found in bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a rhizome that produces a single, leafy stem. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike, and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
