<p>Dichaea pendula var. swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's weeping bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its cascading, pendulous inflorescence that produces small, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves form a rosette that collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
