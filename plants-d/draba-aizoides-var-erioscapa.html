<p>Draba aizoides var. erioscapa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, with a hairy surface that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The varietal name *erioscapa* refers to the dense, hairy covering on the stems and leaves, which helps protect the plant from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
