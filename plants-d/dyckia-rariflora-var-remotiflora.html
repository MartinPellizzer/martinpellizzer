<p>Dyckia rariflora var. remotiflora, commonly known as the remote-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that enclose its small, tubular flowers, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic landscapes.</p>
