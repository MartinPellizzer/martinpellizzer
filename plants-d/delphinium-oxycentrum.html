                    <h1>Delphinium oxycentrum</h1>
<p>Delphinium oxycentrum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
