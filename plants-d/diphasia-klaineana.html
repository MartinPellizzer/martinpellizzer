<p>Diphasia klaineana, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forested areas. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its preservation.</p>
