<p>Delphinium anthora, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Delphinium anthora is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish.</p>
