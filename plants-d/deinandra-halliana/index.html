                            <h1>Deinandra Halliana</h1>
<p>Deinandra halliana is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It is known for its unique, spiny foliage and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. This species thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and declining populations, it is considered vulnerable to environmental threats. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring its survival in the wild.</p>
