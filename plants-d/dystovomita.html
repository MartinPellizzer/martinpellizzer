                    <h1>Dystovomita</h1>
<p>Dystovomita, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Its unique adaptations suggest it has evolved to thrive in low-light, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dystovomita is considered critically endangered.</p>
