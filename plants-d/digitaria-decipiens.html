                    <h1>Digitaria decipiens</h1>
<p>Digitaria decipiens, commonly known as the false brome, is a grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria decipiens thrives in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it is often found in moist or wet habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
