                    <h1>Dryopteris brachypoda</h1>
<p>Dryopteris brachypoda, commonly known as the short-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
