<p>Dendrobium neolampangense, commonly known as the Lampang orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered growth habit and long, wiry stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
