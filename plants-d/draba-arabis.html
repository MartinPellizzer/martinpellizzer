<p>Draba arabis, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba arabis typically thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle allows it to complete its growth and reproduction before the summer heat arrives.</p>
