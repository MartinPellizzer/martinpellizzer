                    <h1>Dryopteris spenceri</h1>
<p>Dryopteris spenceri, commonly known as the Spenser's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
