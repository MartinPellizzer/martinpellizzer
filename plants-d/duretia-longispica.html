<p>Duretia longispica, commonly known as the long-spined duretia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated spines that adorn its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, arid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
