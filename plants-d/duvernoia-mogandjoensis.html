<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
