                    <h1>Desmazeria oblitera</h1>
<p>Desmazeria oblitera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as swamp forests and is often found on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
