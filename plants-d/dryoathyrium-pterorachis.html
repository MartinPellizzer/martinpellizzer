<p>Dryoathyrium pterorachis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Dryoathyrium pterorachis make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
