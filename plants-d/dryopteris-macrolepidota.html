<p>Dryopteris macrolepidota, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a thick, wiry rhizome and large, compound leaves with a distinctive shield-shaped outline. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
