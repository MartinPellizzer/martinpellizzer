                    <h1>Digitaria pusilla</h1>
<p>Digitaria pusilla, commonly known as little fingergrass, is a small annual grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its low height and compact growth, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
