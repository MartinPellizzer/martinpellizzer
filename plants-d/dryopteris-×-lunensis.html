                    <h1>Dryopteris × lunensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × lunensis, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elegantly divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
