<p>Dolicholobium oxylobum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leafed dolicholobium, is a variant of the dolicholobium species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its elliptical, smooth-surfaced leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or pale green, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
