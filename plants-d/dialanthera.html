                    <h1>Dialanthera</h1>
<p>Dialanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only at night, often in the dry season. The flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, and have a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Dialanthera species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to their short blooming period and rare occurrence, they are considered elusive and are of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
