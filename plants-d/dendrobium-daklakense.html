<p>Dendrobium daklakense, commonly known as the Dak Lak orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive pattern of markings. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium daklakense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
