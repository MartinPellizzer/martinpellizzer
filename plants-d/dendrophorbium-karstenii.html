                    <h1>Dendrophorbium karstenii</h1>
<p>Dendrophorbium karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten's tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. The plant's thallus is typically flat and leaf-like, with a leathery texture and a dark green to brownish color. It grows on tree bark, particularly on deciduous trees, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Dendrophorbium karstenii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
