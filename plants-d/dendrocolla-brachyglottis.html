                    <h1>Dendrocolla brachyglottis</h1>
<p>Dendrocolla brachyglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dune grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal dune ecosystems in South Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often recurved, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Dendrocolla brachyglottis plays an important ecological role in preventing dune erosion and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
