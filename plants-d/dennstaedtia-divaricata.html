<p>Dennstaedtia divaricata, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two main branches, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brownish, moss-like tissue.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
