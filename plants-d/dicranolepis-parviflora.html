                    <h1>Dicranolepis parviflora</h1>
<p>Dicranolepis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for reproduction. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
