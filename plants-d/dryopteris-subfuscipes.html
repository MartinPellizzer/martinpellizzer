<p>Dryopteris subfuscipes, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
