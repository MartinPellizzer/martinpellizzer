<p>Dendrobium dockrillii, commonly known as the Australian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
