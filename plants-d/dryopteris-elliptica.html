                    <h1>Dryopteris elliptica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a hairy indusium.</p>
