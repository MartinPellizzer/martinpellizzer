<p>Daemonorops manillensis, commonly known as the Manila rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, dark blue-black fruits. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
