<p>Diplazium membranaceum, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, membranous fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fertile leaves.</p>
