                    <h1>Dondisia epipactis</h1>
<p>Dondisia epipactis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy purple flower with intricate petal structures. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, ensuring optimal conditions for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Dondisia epipactis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
