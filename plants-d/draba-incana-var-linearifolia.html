                    <h1>Draba incana var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Draba incana var. linearifolia, commonly known as the slender whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it its species name *linearifolia*. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
