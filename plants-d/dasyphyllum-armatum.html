<p>Dasyphyllum armatum, commonly known as the woolly dasyphyllum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Dasyphyllum armatum is often found growing in rocky areas or along dry streambeds.</p>
