                    <h1>Disteganthus morrenianus</h1>
<p>Disteganthus morrenianus, commonly known as the Morren's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
