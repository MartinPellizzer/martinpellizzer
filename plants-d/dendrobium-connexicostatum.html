<p>Dendrobium connexicostatum, commonly known as the waxy leaching orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually narrow and革质 (leathery). It blooms with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings.</p>
<p>This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
