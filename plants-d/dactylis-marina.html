<p>Dactylis marina, commonly known as sea pasture, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries, mudflats, and tidal zones. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Dactylis marina plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
