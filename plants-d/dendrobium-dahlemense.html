<p>Dendrobium dahlemense, commonly known as the Dahlem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, often fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Dendrobium dahlemense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions.</p>
