<p>Dalbergia tonkinensis, commonly known as Tonkin rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. The plant has bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several flattened, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
