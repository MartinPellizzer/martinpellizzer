<p>Dinochloa trichogona, commonly known as the hairy grass or dwarf hairgrass, is a small, low-growing plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and often thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Dinochloa trichogona is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
