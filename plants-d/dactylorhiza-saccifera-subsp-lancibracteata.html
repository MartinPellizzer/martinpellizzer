<p>Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp.</p>
<p>lancibracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor habitats such as peat bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant features erect, grass-like leaves and produces tall flowering stems with numerous showy, pink to purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are crucial for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and longer bracts compared to other members of the species.</p>
