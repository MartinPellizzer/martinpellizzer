                    <h1>Dryopteris macropholis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris macropholis, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This species is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the understory.</p>
