<p>Dryopteris gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous wood fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Dryopteris gemmifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
