                    <h1>Daucus tenuissimus</h1>
<p>Daucus tenuissimus, commonly known as the slender carrot, is a small, annual herb belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Its roots are slender and not as fleshy as those of the common carrot, making it less cultivated for food.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited agricultural value, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
