                    <h1>Dieteria canescens var. aristata</h1>
<p>Dieteria canescens var. aristata, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, puffy seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
