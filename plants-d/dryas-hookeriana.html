<p>Dryas hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Dryas hookeriana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountain soils and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
