<p>Dendrobium pentanema, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually革质 (leathery) and arranged in a spiral pattern. Dendrobium pentanema produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate veining.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
