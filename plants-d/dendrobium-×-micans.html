                    <h1>Dendrobium × micans</h1>
<p>Dendrobium × micans, commonly known as the orchid with the golden lip, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive golden or yellow lip that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Dendrobium × micans is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
