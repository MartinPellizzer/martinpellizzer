                    <h1>Dicerma biarticulatum var. australiense</h1>
<p>Dicerma biarticulatum var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian flatback spider, is a species of orb-weaving spider found primarily in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, and often brightly colored carapace, which provides camouflage in its natural habitat. The spider constructs circular, sheet-like webs, typically in shrubs or trees, to catch flying insects. Its venom is relatively mild compared to other spider species, making it less dangerous to humans.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to various environments across the Australian continent.</p>
