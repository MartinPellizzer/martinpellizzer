<p>Disa nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyika orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Nyika Plateau of Malawi.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow lips. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open grassland areas. It has slender, erect stems with few leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
