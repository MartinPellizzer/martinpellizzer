<p>Diplazium turgidum, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces floating or submerged fronds, which are usually broad and pinnate. Its leaves are often rich in nutrients and can provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Diplazium turgidum plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and oxygenating the water.</p>
