<p>Digitaria sanguinalis f. ciliaris is a variant of the common grass known as Digitaria sanguinalis, often found in disturbed soils across various climates. This particular form is distinguished by its distinctive hairy margins on the leaves, giving it a unique appearance compared to its parent species. It thrives in open areas such as fields and roadsides, where it can quickly colonize new ground. The plant is adaptable and resilient, making it a common sight in many regions. Its presence often indicates soil disturbance or environmental change.</p>
