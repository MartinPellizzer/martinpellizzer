                    <h1>Dendrobium sertatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium sertatum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium sertatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
