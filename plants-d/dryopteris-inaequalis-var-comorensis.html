                    <h1>Dryopteris inaequalis var. comorensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris inaequalis var. comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian wood fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern native to the Comoros archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the sori are clustered in short rows along the veins of the lower fronds. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a notable species within the Dryopteris genus.</p>
