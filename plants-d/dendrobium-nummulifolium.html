<p>Dendrobium nummulifolium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium nummulifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display.</p>
