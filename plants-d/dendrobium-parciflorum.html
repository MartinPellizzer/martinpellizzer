                    <h1>Dendrobium parciflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium parciflorum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
