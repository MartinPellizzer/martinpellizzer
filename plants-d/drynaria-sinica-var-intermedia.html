                    <h1>Drynaria sinica var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Drynaria sinica var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliff fern, is a variant of the drynaria fern that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates, demonstrating a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
