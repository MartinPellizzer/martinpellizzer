                    <h1>Dryopteris donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
