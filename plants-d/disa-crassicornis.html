                    <h1>Disa crassicornis</h1>
<p>Disa crassicornis, commonly known as the broad-horned disa, is a striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces clusters of tubular or spurred flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Disa crassicornis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
