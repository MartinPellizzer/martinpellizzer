<p>Diplazium tenerum, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that grow in a cascading pattern. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, leathery scales, which help protect it from environmental stress.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, lance-shaped segments that give the plant its elegant, fern-like appearance.</p>
