<p>Dalea emarginata, commonly known as the fringe-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Dalea emarginata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>
