                    <h1>Dicranopteris pedata</h1>
<p>Dicranopteris pedata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in water while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris pedata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
