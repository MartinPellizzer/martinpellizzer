<p>Dendrobium stipiticola, commonly known as the stipitate dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Dendrobium stipiticola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
