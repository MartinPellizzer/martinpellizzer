<p>Dactylorhiza × hallii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant prefers moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and marshes. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Dactylorhiza × hallii is characterized by its distinctive, recurved petals and is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its ecological and horticultural significance.</p>
