<p>Desmos saccopetaloides, commonly known as the waxflower or sweet flower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Desmos saccopetaloides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance.</p>
