                    <h1>Dasylirion inerme</h1>
<p>Dasylirion inerme, commonly known as the desert dagger, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences bearing clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in the spring. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
