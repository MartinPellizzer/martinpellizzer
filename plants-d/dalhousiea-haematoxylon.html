                    <h1>Dalhousiea haematoxylon</h1>
<p>Dalhousiea haematoxylon, commonly known as the redwood lichen, is a unique lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with high solar exposure. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that can range in color from brown to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions. It lacks true leaves, stems, or roots, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions and ecological stability.</p>
