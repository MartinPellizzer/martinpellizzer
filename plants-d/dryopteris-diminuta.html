<p>Dryopteris diminuta, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are divided into small, shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact size and lush foliage.</p>
