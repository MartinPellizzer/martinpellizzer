<p>Dictyostega orobanchoides, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous and clustered in spikes. Its life cycle involves a dormant stage as a seed, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
