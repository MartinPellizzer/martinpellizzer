                    <h1>Dendrobium meiernianum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium meiernianum, commonly known as the Meiernian orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip, making it visually striking.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
