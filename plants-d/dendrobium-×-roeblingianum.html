<p>Dendrobium × roeblingianum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care.</p>
