                    <h1>Dactylanthes</h1>
<p>Dactylanthes, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Dactylanthes is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
