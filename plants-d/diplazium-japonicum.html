<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Diplazium japonicum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
