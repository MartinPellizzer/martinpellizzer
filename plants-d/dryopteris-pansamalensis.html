                    <h1>Dryopteris pansamalensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pansamalensis, commonly known as the Panam√° shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
