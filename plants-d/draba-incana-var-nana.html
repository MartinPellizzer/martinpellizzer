<p>Draba incana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single umbel. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
