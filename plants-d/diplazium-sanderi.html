<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves.</p>
