                    <h1>Dryopteris arborescens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris arborescens, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored band near the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
