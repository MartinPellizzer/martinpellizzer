<p>Dalea botterii, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple pea-like flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compound leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Dalea botterii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
