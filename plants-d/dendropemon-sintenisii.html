                    <h1>Dendropemon sintenisii</h1>
<p>Dendropemon sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
