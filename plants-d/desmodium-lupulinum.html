                    <h1>Desmodium lupulinum</h1>
<p>Desmodium lupulinum, commonly known as yellow burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Desmodium lupulinum is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and pastures, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
