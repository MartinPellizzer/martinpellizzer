                    <h1>Dendrophthoe mirifica</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe mirifica, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a host tree, primarily in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental berries, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
