                    <h1>Dryopteris oligocarpa var. retusa</h1>
<p>Dryopteris oligocarpa var. retusa, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively through runners.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the underside of the leaves.</p>
