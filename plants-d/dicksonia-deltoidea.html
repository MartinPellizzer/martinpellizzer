<p>Dicksonia deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which are used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>The delta fern is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
