<p>Diasperus malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
