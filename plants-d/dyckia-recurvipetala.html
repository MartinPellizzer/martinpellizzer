<p>Dyckia recurvipetala, commonly known as the recurved feather plant, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The leaves are recurved, meaning they curve backward, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on a spadix, which are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>This species is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil.</p>
