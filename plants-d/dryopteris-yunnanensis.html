<p>Dryopteris yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan shield fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
