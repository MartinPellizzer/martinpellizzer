<p>Drosera glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>Drosera glanduligera is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
