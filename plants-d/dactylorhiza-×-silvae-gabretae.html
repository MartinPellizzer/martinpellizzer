<p>Dactylorhiza × silvae-gabretae, commonly known as the forest bog orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths, where it thrives in shaded conditions. The plant features a tall, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves, and it produces spikes of pale purple or greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the nutrient-poor soils it inhabits.</p>
