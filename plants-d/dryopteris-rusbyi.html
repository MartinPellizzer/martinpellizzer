<p>Dryopteris rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance.</p>
