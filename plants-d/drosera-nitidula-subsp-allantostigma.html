<p>Drosera nitidula subsp.</p>
<p>allantostigma, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are linear and often curved, with a dense covering of digestive secretions.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
