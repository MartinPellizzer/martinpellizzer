                    <h1>Dactylis glomerata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Dactylis glomerata var. glabrata, commonly known as silky grass or sweet veld, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are generally hairless, giving it a smooth appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of grassland ecosystems and agricultural systems.</p>
