                    <h1>Delphinium lithophilum</h1>
<p>Delphinium lithophilum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Delphinium lithophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in its native range.</p>
