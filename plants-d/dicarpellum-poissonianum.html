                    <h1>Dicarpellum poissonianum</h1>
<p>Dicarpellum poissonianum, commonly known as the Poisson's dicarpellum, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicarpellaceae and is notable for its bilateral symmetry and specialized reproductive organs. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of stamens and carpels, which are fused into a single structure called a gynostemon. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded environments with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of great interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant adaptations.</p>
