                    <h1>Dracocephalum moldavica var. bipinnatum</h1>
<p>Dracocephalum moldavica var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the fringed caraway, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that are often hairy, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in herbal teas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical D. moldavica due to its more finely divided leaves and unique floral structure.</p>
