                    <h1>Dentillaria plantaginea</h1>
<p>Dentillaria plantaginea, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its milky sap and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has a taproot system and can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested for herbal use, though the plant is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
