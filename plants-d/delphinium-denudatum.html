                    <h1>Delphinium denudatum</h1>
<p>Delphinium denudatum, commonly known as the nakedleaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often reduced or absent near the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
