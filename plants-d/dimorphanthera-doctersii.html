<p>Dimorphanthera doctersii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a slender, creeping rhizome and small, strap-like leaves. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
