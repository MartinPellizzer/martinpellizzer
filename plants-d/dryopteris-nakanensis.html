<p>Dryopteris nakanensis, commonly known as the Nakan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
