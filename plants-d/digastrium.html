                    <h1>Digastrium</h1>
<p>Digastrium, commonly known as the lower jaw muscle, is a critical component of the plant's anatomy, particularly in certain species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>It is responsible for the movement and support of the lower jaw, enabling essential functions such as feeding and defense. The structure of the digastrium is characterized by its fibrous composition, which allows for both strength and flexibility. It is typically attached to the lower jawbone and the surrounding tissues, facilitating precise muscle action.</p>
<p>This anatomical feature plays a vital role in the plant's survival and adaptation to its environment.</p>
