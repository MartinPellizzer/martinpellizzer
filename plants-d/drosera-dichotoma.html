<p>Drosera dichotoma, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters at the end of leafless stems.</p>
<p>Drosera dichotoma is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils by obtaining nutrients from captured prey.</p>
