                    <h1>Dactylis caudata</h1>
<p>Dactylis caudata, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that resemble a beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Dactylis caudata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
