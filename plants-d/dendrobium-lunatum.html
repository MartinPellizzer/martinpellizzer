                    <h1>Dendrobium lunatum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium lunatum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, drooping inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble a crescent moon, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates with high light exposure and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Dendrobium lunatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
