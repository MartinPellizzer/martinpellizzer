                    <h1>Drabopsis brevisiliqua</h1>
<p>Drabopsis brevisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Drabopsis brevisiliqua is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
