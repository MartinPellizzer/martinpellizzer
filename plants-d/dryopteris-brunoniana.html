<p>Dryopteris brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunon's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact clusters called sori.</p>
