                    <h1>Draba aizoides var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Draba aizoides var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves that are densely covered with white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
