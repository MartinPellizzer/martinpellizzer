<p>Dryopteris sororia, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of polypody fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Dryopteris sororia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
