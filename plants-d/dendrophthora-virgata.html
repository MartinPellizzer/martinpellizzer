<p>Dendrophthora virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces white, waxy flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are small, red, and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Dendrophthora virgata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
