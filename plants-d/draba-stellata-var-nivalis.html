                    <h1>Draba stellata var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Draba stellata var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous species with basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
