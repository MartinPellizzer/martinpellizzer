<p>Dianthus brevicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>setaceus, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with tightly packed, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming a cushion-like structure, which helps it survive in rocky or dry environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are usually five-petaled and showy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
