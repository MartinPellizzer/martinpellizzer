<p>Diplazium marrattiifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes are often anchored to submerged substrates, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Diplazium marrattiifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
