<p>Deherainia lageniformis, commonly known as the bottle-shaped fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, bottle-like fronds.</p>
<p>Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are elongated and cylindrical, resembling glass bottles, which gives it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
