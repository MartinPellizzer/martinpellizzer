                    <h1>Dryopteris leptocladia</h1>
<p>Dryopteris leptocladia, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
