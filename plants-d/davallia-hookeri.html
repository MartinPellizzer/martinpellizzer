<p>Davallia hookeri, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
