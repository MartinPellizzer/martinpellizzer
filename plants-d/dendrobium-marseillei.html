                    <h1>Dendrobium marseillei</h1>
<p>Dendrobium marseillei, commonly known as the Marseille orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and seasonal blooming make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
