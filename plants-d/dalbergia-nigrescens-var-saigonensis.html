<p>Dalbergia nigrescens var. saigonensis, commonly known as Vietnamese rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent, making it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
