                    <h1>Diplachne dubia</h1>
<p>Diplachne dubia, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne dubia is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
