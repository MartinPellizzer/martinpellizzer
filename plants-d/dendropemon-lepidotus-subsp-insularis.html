<p>Dendropemon lepidotus subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island tree fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on certain tropical islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
