                    <h1>Deparia × birii</h1>
<p>Deparia × birii, commonly known as the hybrid forest fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Deparia crenata and Deparia sinensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Deparia × birii is not typically found in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
