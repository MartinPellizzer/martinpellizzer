<p>Davallia distans, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of waxy, leathery fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name.

<p>Davallia distans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
