                <h1>Drimia namibensis</h1>
<p>Drimia namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers during the rainy season, typically from October to December. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Drimia namibensis is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the local ecosystem.</p>
