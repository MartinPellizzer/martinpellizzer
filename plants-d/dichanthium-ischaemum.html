<p>Dichanthium ischaemum, commonly known as Indian ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its seeds are also a source of food for various wildlife species.</p>
