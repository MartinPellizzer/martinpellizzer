<p>Dioscorea nummularia var. belophylla, commonly known as the white yam, is a variant of the yam family native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not typically cultivated for food due to their bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in shaded, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
