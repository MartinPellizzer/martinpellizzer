<p>Dracula sodiroi subsp.</p>
<p>erythrocodon, commonly known as the Red-caped Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange floral bracts, which are highly specialized structures that serve both ornamental and possibly reproductive functions.</p>
<p>The plant produces elongated, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, intricate flowers with dark purple petals and yellow sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
