<p>Diasperus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Diasperus rotundifolius is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in regions where it is found.</p>
