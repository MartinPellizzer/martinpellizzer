                    <h1>Dryopteris boryana</h1>
<p>Dryopteris boryana, commonly known as the Bory's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a feathery structure composed of multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish and spread effectively in suitable habitats.</p>
