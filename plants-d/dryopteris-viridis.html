                    <h1>Dryopteris viridis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris viridis, commonly known as the green wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
