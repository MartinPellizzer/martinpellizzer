                    <h1>Dryadella crenulata</h1>
<p>Dryadella crenulata, commonly known as the smoothleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dense, leathery thallus with a smooth, greenish to yellowish upper surface. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
