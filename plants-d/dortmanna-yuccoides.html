                    <h1>Dortmanna yuccoides</h1>
<p>Dortmanna yuccoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Dortmanna yuccoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to xeriscaping.</p>
