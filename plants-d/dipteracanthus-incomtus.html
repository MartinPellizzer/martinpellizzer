                    <h1>Dipteracanthus incomtus</h1>
<p>Dipteracanthus incomtus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble small, ghostly apparitions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
