<p>Delphinium arenarium, commonly known as the sand delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Delphinium arenarium is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
