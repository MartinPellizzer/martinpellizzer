<p>Dehaasia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and slightly lobed, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a habitat for aquatic insects and as an indicator species for wetland health.</p>
