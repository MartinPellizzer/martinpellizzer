                    <h1>Dracaena longipetiolata</h1>
<p>Dracaena longipetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white stripes, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena longipetiolata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and air-purifying properties.</p>
