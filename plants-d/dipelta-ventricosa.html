<p>Dipelta ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
