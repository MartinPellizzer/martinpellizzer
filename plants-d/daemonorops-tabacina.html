<p>Daemonorops tabacina, commonly known as the tobacco cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
