                    <h1>Diapedium</h1>
<p>Diapedium, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for those of lilies, though it is not closely related. Diapedium thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and unique appearance.</p>
