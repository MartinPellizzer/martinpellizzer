<p>Dendrocalamus farinosus f. flavostriatus, commonly known as the golden-striped bamboo, is a variant of the giant bamboo species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow stripes on the culms, which distinguish it from other members of the Dendrocalamus genus. The plant grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its culms are tall and slender, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and are used in construction and handicrafts.</p>
