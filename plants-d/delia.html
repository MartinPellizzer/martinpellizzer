                    <h1>Delia</h1>
<p>Delia, commonly known as the cabbage fly, is a small, delicate insect that is not a plant but a pest affecting Brassica crops.</p>
<p>While not a botanical subject itself, it is often confused with the Delia genus of flowering plants. The Delia genus includes several species of flowering plants, such as Delia carota, which is a type of flowering plant native to Europe. These plants typically have small, clustered flowers and are often found in grassy areas.</p>
<p>They are not commonly cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique floral structures.</p>
