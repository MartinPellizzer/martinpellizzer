                    <h1>Deschampsia shiretokoensis</h1>
<p>Deschampsia shiretokoensis, commonly known as Shiretoko grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Shiretoko Peninsula in Japan.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that thrives in moist, cool environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its restricted habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
