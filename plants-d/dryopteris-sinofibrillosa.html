<p>Dryopteris sinofibrillosa, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
