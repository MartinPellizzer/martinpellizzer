                    <h1>Dracaena petiolata</h1>
<p>Dracaena petiolata, commonly known as the dragon tree or ribbon plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dracaena petiolata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying properties.</p>
