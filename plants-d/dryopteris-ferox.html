<p>Dryopteris ferox, commonly known as the humped back wood fern, is a robust fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Dryopteris ferox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual impact.</p>
