                    <h1>Dipsacus palustris</h1>
<p>Dipsacus palustris, commonly known as the marsh teasel, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny bur that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals.</p>
<p>Dipsacus palustris is often found in damp meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
