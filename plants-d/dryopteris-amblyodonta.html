                    <h1>Dryopteris amblyodonta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris amblyodonta, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, hairy layer called the indusium.</p>
