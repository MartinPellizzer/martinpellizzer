<p>Diplazium divisissimum, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous segments, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
