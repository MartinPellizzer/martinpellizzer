                    <h1>Dracula aphrodes</h1>
<p>Dracula aphrodes, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Dracula aphrodes thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing on trees in the canopy.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
