                    <h1>Desmodium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Desmodium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility.</p>
