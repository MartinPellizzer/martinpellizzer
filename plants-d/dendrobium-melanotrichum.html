                    <h1>Dendrobium melanotrichum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium melanotrichum, commonly known as the black-haired orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with dark purple or black markings on the petals and sepals.</p>
<p>Dendrobium melanotrichum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
