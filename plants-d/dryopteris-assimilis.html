<p>Dryopteris assimilis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
