                    <h1>Disa cryptantha</h1>
<p>Disa cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, native to the misty mountain forests of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Disa cryptantha is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
