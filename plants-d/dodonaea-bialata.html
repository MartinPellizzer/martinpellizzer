<p>Dodonaea bialata, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Dodonaea bialata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
