                    <h1>Dryopteris austriaca</h1>
<p>Dryopteris austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months.</p>
