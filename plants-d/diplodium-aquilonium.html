<p>It is characterized by its delicate, airy fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Diplodium aquilonium provides insights into the adaptation strategies of ferns in specialized ecological niches.</p>
