<p>Dactylorhiza × aschersoniana, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late autumn to early winter. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during periods of dormancy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming season.</p>
