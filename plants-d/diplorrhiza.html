<p>Diplorrhiza, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in areas with sandy soils and saline conditions. Diplorrhiza species are characterized by their succulent, often spiny leaves and showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. They are adapted to thrive in harsh, coastal environments, with some species able to tolerate high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Diplorrhiza acanthifolia and Diplorrhiza hirta, which are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological resilience.</p>
