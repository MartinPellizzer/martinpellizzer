                    <h1>Dalbergia variabilis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Dalbergia variabilis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *rosewood* in some regions, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by legumes containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some areas.</p>
