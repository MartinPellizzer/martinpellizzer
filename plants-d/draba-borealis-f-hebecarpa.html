<p>Draba borealis f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are white or pale yellow, bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects.</p>
