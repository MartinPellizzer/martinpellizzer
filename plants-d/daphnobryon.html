                    <h1>Daphnobryon</h1>
<p>Daphnobryon, commonly known as the golden moss, is a unique liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterygopcales and is characterized by its delicate, branched structure. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with leaf-like structures called phyllids that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Daphnobryon is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, contain spores that are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
