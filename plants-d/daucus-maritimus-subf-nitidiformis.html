<p>Daucus maritimus subf.</p>
<p>nitidiformis, commonly known as the smooth-form sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its distinctive, often blue or purple flower heads. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are arranged in a single, showy head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than those of the main species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in maritime ecosystems along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>
