                    <h1>Dendrophthora leptostachya</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or pale flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis independently.</p>
<p>This relationship can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species.</p>
