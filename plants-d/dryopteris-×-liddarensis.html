                    <h1>Dryopteris × liddarensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × liddarensis, commonly known as the Liddar Valley fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing fronds in the summer, which are usually darker in color and have a more robust structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
