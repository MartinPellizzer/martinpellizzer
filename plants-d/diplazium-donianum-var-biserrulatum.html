                    <h1>Diplazium donianum var. biserrulatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium donianum var. biserrulatum, commonly known as the serrated staghorn fern, is a rare and unique variant of the staghorn fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant features a thick, wiry rhizome that supports the fronds and helps anchor it to its host, typically trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually serrated, with a rugged texture that distinguishes it from other varieties.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in shaded, moist conditions with high humidity.</p>
