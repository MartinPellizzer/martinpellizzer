                    <h1>Dryopteris velata</h1>
<p>Dryopteris velata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, which adds to the plant's ornamental value in gardens.</p>
