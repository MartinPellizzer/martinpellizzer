                    <h1>Dendrophthoe sphenoidea</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe sphenoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthetic support through its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
