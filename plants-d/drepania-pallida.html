<p>Drepania pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate in wetlands and ponds. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Drepania pallida plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
