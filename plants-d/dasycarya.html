                    <h1>Dasycarya</h1>
<p>Dasycarya, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are composite life forms consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Dasycarya species are often found growing on rocky surfaces, especially in arid or semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their crust-like growth form and dark, often black or brown, colored thallus.</p>
<p>Due to their ability to survive in harsh conditions, they play an important role in soil stabilization and ecological succession in rocky habitats.</p>
