                    <h1>Dendrophthora verrucosa</h1>
<p>Dendrophthora verrucosa, commonly known as the疣孢树菌, is a parasitic fungus that primarily infects broadleaf trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, rubbery, and often wart-like fruiting bodies that develop on the bark of infected hosts. The fungus spreads through spores released from these structures, which can be carried by wind or water. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the host tree's vascular system, leading to weakened growth and, in severe cases, tree death.</p>
