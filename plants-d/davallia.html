                    <h1>Davallia</h1>
<p>Davallia, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique, creeping growth habit and delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>Native to tropical and subtropical regions, these plants thrive in humid environments with well-draining soil. The fronds are typically arching and composed of small, needle-like pinnae, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Davallia species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
<p>They reproduce through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
