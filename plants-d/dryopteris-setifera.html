                    <h1>Dryopteris setifera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris setifera, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, airy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
