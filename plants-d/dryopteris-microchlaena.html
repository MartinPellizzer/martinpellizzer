                    <h1>Dryopteris microchlaena</h1>
<p>Dryopteris microchlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
