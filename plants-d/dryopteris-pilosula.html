                    <h1>Dryopteris pilosula</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pilosula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
