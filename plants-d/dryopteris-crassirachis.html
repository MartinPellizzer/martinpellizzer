<p>Dryopteris crassirachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
