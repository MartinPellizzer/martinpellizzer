<p>Dendrobium conostalix, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Dendrobium conostalix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
