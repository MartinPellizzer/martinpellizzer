<p>Dactylis smithii subsp.</p>
<p>marina, commonly known as sea dactylis, is a coastal grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in saline and windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in maritime climates, often found on dunes, cliffs, and other coastal habitats. Its adaptability to salt spray and poor soils makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
<p>The flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread along shorelines.</p>
