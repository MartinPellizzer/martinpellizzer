                    <h1>Deyeuxia rupestris var. minor</h1>
<p>Deyeuxia rupestris var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats, where it often grows in clusters.</p>
