                    <h1>Draba sauteri var. trichocaulis</h1>
<p>Draba sauteri var. trichocaulis, commonly known as the hairy-rooted whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in elongated racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in remote, high-altitude areas.</p>
