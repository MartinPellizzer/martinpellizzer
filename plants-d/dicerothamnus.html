                    <h1>Dicerothamnus</h1>
<p>Dicerothamnus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and showy, typically pink or purple flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Dicerothamnus species are often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
