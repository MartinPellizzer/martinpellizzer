                    <h1>Dryopteris reptans var. tenera</h1>
<p>Dryopteris reptans var. tenera, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a varietal form of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing fronds that often form a thick carpet on the forest floor. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
