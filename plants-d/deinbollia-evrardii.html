                    <h1>Deinbollia evrardii</h1>
<p>Deinbollia evrardii, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
