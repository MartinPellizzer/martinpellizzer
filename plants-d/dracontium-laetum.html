                    <h1>Dracontium laetum</h1>
<p>Dracontium laetum, commonly known as the golden arrow plant, is a striking tropical perennial native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, reflective coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Dracontium laetum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
