                    <h1>Diphasiastrum falcatum</h1>
<p>Diphasiastrum falcatum, commonly known as the creeping smilacina, is a low-growing fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous stem that produces both leaves and sporangia, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, slightly curved shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
