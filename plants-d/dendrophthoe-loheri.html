                    <h1>Dendrophthoe loheri</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe loheri, commonly known as the Loher's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
