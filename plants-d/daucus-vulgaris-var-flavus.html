                    <h1>Daucus vulgaris var. flavus</h1>
<p>Daucus vulgaris var. flavus, commonly known as the yellow bur marigold, is a variant of the wild carrot species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink flowers of the common Daucus vulgaris. The plant produces small, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>The yellow variant is less common than the standard form, making it a notable botanical curiosity.</p>
