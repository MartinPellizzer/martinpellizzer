                    <h1>Dipodium punctatum var. squamatum</h1>
<p>Dipodium punctatum var. squamatum, commonly known as the scaled dipodium, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
