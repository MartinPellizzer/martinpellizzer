<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its "woolly" appearance.</p>
<p>The variety leiosepalum is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous sepals, which set it apart from other varieties within the species.</p>
