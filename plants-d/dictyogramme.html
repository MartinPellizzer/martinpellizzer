<p>Dictyogramme, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. Dictyogramme species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
<p>The genus is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions.</p>
