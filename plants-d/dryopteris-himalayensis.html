<p>Dryopteris himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>

The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
