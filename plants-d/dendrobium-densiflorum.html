                    <h1>Dendrobium densiflorum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of dense, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Dendrobium densiflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
