                    <h1>Dunnia</h1>
<p>Dunnia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, and they produce showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Dunnia species are often found in moist or disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands.</p>
<p>They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals depending on the climate.</p>
