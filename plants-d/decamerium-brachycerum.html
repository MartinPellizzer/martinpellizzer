                <h1>Decamerium brachycerum</h1>
<p>Decamerium brachycerum, commonly known as the short-capped decamerium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
