<p>Diplazium arboreum var. otites, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
