                    <h1>Dendrophthoe coccinea</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe coccinea, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis through its leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its growth is often limited to the upper branches of its host, where it forms dense clusters.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe coccinea plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting biodiversity.</p>
