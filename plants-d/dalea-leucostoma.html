                    <h1>Dalea leucostoma</h1>
<p>Dalea leucostoma, commonly known as white-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Dalea leucostoma plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
