                    <h1>Dryopteris × macdonellii</h1>
<p>Dryopteris × macdonellii, commonly known as the Macdonnell's wood fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomaculata.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often exhibit a dark green color with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
