<p>Deyeuxia hygrometrica, commonly known as the moisture-sensitive grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant is particularly sensitive to changes in soil moisture, which influences its growth patterns and distribution. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color.</p>
<p>Deyeuxia hygrometrica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
