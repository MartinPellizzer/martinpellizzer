                    <h1>Drynaria tibetica</h1>
<p>Drynaria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cliff fern, is a perennial fern species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, including regions in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces sterile fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
