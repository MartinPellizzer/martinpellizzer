<p>Dendrobium jubatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in winter or early spring, producing fragrant, lance-shaped petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium jubatum is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
