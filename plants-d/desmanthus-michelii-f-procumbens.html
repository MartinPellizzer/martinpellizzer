                    <h1>Desmanthus michelii f. procumbens</h1>
<p>Desmanthus michelii f. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration.</p>
<p>Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, covering the ground and preventing erosion.</p>
