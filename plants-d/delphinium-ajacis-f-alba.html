<p>Delphinium ajacis f. alba, commonly known as the white larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>

The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.</p>
