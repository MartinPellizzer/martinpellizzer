                    <h1>Dyckia brachystachya</h1>
<p>Dyckia brachystachya, commonly known as the compact dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
