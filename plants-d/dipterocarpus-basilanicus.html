<p>Dipterocarpus basilanicus, commonly known as the Malay ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sturdy trunk and thick, bark-like outer layer that provides protection against pests and environmental stress.

It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its dense wood, it is highly valued for construction and furniture-making, though its habitat is threatened by deforestation.</p>
