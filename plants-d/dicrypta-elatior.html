                    <h1>Dicrypta elatior</h1>
<p>Dicrypta elatior, commonly known as the tall mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Dicrypta elatior relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
