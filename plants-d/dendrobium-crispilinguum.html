<p>Dendrobium crispilinguum, commonly known as the crinkled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate, crinkled appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Dendrobium crispilinguum thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
