                    <h1>Daucus carota var. fontanesii</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii carrot, is a rare subspecies of the wild carrot.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This variant is native to Central Europe and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its root is typically smaller and less developed compared to the common carrot, making it more valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
