<p>Dendrobium ruckeri, commonly known as the Rucker's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or along stream banks. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, adapting it to its moist but not waterlogged habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrobium ruckeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>
