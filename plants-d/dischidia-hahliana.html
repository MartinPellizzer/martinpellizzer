<p>Dischidia hahliana, commonly known as the Hahli's fig.</p>
<p>It is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals.</p>
<p>Dischidia hahliana is well adapted to life on trees, where it uses its aerial roots to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
