                    <h1>Dielsia cygnorum</h1>
<p>Dielsia cygnorum, commonly known as the Swan's Foot Plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a short, thick stem that supports its foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dielsia cygnorum is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
