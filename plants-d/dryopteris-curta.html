                    <h1>Dryopteris curta</h1>
<p>Dryopteris curta, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of polypodiales fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
