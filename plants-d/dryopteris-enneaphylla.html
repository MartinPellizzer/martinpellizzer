                <h1>Dryopteris enneaphylla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris enneaphylla, commonly known as the nine-feather fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are divided into nine pairs of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their foliage throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
