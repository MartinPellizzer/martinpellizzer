                    <h1>Dyscritogyne</h1>
<p>Dyscritogyne, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, with a distinct, sometimes hairy texture. Dyscritogyne species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are often found in woodland or disturbed soils, and they play a role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
