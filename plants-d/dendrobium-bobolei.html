<p>Dendrobium bobolei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Dendrobium bobolei is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
