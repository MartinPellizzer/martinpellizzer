<p>Draba aureiformis, commonly known as the golden leafed winter cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Draba aureiformis is a hardy species that thrives in harsh climates, making it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
