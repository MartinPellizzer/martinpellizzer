                    <h1>Desmanthus arborescens</h1>
<p>Desmanthus arborescens, commonly known as the tree desmanthus, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Desmanthus arborescens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
