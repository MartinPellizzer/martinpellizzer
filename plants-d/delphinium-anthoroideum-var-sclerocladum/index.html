Its unique foliage features thick, leathery leaves that help it withstand harsh climates. The plant is highly valued by botanists and gardeners for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
