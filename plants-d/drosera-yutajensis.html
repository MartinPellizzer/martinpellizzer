<p>Drosera yutajensis, commonly known as the Yutajensis Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as swamps and bogs. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette and are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological niche.</p>
