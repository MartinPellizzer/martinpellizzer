<p>Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp.</p>
<p>romana, commonly known as the Roman marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of pale pink to purple flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
