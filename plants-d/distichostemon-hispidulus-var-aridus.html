                    <h1>Distichostemon hispidulus var. aridus</h1>
<p>Distichostemon hispidulus var. aridus, commonly known as the desert mistflower, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
