                    <h1>Drosera rotundifolia var. maritima</h1>
<p>Drosera rotundifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal sundew, is a variant of the round-leaf sundew native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, sticky leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, heaths, and sandy coastal areas. Its flowers are typically small, pink or reddish, and arranged in a dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
