                    <h1>Dichromena</h1>
<p>Dichromena, commonly known as the "sensitive plant" or "touch-me-not," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or moist environments. Dichromena species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually purple or violet in color.</p>
<p>These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique leaf movements.</p>
