<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
