                    <h1>Dendrophthoe longituba</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically oval and arranged in opposite pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe longituba is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
