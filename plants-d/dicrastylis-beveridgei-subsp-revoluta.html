<p>Dicrastylis beveridgei subsp.</p>
<p>revoluta, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush due to its dense, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salty and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly revolute margin, contributing to its subspecific identification.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
