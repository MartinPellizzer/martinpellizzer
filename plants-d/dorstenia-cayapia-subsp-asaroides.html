<p>Dorstenia cayapia subsp.</p>
<p>asaroides, commonly known as the Cayapia asaroides, is a member of the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique and often striking floral structures. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its elongated, spiraling inflorescences and distinctive, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its morphological diversity and potential ecological roles in its ecosystem.</p>
