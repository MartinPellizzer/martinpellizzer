                    <h1>Dendroseris micrantha var. pruinata</h1>
<p>Dendroseris micrantha var. pruinata, commonly known as the pruinose dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
