<p>Deparia conilii f. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim Island shield fern, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a broad, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores, which are released during the reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
