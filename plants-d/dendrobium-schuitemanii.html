                    <h1>Dendrobium schuitemanii</h1>
<p>Dendrobium schuitemanii, commonly known as the Schuiteman's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
