                    <h1>Delosperma repens</h1>
<p>Delosperma repens, commonly known as ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Delosperma repens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
