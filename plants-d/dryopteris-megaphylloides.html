                    <h1>Dryopteris megaphylloides</h1>
<p>Dryopteris megaphylloides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern North America, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce sporangia on the underside. Its distinctive, broad, and often deeply lobed leaves make it a striking addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
