<p>Dracontia viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered dragon fern, is a rare and unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers and a distinctive, fern-like frond structure. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dracontia viridiflava is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
