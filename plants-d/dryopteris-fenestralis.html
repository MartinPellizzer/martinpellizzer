<p>Dryopteris fenestralis, commonly known as the fenestrated wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of rounded, fenestrated (window-like) gaps along the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
