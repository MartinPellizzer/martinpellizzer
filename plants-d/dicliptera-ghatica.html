                    <h1>Dicliptera ghatica</h1>
<p>Dicliptera ghatica, commonly known as the Indian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow waters or moist soils, thriving in marshy environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Dicliptera ghatica is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
