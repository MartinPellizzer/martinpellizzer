<p>Dendrobium hodgkinsonii, commonly known as the Hodgkinson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cane-like pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with red or pink markings. It thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
