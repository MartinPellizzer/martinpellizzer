                            <h1>Dorycnium Rectum</h1>
<p>Dorycnium rectum, also known as the common goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and fern-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. It has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, making it both a valuable and challenging species.</p>
