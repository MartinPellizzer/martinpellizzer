                    <h1>Draba glabella var. megasperma</h1>
<p>Draba glabella var. megasperma, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils and extreme cold.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for harsh environments, contributing to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
