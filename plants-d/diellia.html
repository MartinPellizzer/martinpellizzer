                    <h1>Diellia</h1>
<p>Diellia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. Diellia species are characterized by their striking blue or purple ray florets and compact, spiky flower heads. They are often used in ornamental gardening for their drought tolerance and ability to withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Diellia maritima and Diellia taurica, which are valued for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
