<p>Digitaria eriantha subsp.</p>
<p>stolonifera, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like blades with a silvery-white sheen on the underside, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
