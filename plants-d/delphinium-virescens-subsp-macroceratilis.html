<p>Delphinium virescens subsp.</p>
<p>macroceratilis, commonly known as the giant blue larkspur, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces long, slender seed pods that split open at maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that are harmful to humans and animals.</p>
