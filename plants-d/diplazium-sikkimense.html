<p>Diplazium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Diplazium sikkimense has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new fronds and help the plant spread across the forest floor.</p>
