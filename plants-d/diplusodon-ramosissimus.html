<p>Diplusodon ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy antplant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by various wildlife species. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in the understory of dense forests by utilizing its climbing habit.</p>
<p>The hairy antplant plays a role in supporting ant colonies, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
