                    <h1>Dracula gorgona</h1>
<p>Dracula gorgona, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers that resemble the appearance of a bat's wing, earning it its ominous common name. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Dracula gorgona is known for its delicate and ephemeral blooms, which appear only briefly during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
