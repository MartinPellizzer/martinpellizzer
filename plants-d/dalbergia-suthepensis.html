                    <h1>Dalbergia suthepensis</h1>
<p>Dalbergia suthepensis, commonly known as the Thai rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and compound leaves. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry and musical instrument making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
