                    <h1>Deparia sichuanensis var. gongshanensis</h1>
<p>Deparia sichuanensis var. gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive frilly margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
