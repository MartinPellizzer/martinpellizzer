                    <h1>Digitaria pearsonii</h1>
<p>Digitaria pearsonii, commonly known as pearson's digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>Pearson's digitaria is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
