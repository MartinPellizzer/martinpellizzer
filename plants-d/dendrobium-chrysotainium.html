                    <h1>Dendrobium chrysotainium</h1>
<p>Dendrobium chrysotainium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and gold, which bloom during the summer months. It has long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
