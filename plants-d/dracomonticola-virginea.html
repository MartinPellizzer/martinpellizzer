<p>Dracomonticola virginea, commonly known as the Virgin's Dragon's Blood plant, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep red, sap-like secretion, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
