<p>Dryopteris grossa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a robust fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
