<p>Dalbergia velutina var. velutina, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a fine, even grain, making it highly valued for its aesthetic and functional properties. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. Its leaves are odd-pinnate, with small, elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like fruits containing flattened seeds.</p>
