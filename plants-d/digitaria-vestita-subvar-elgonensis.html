<p>Digitaria vestita subvar. elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon grass, is a perennial grass native to East Africa, particularly found in the highland regions of Kenya and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
