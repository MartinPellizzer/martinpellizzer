<p>Dipterygia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny dipterygia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its unique spiny structures on the stems and leaves help deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Dipterygia spinescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
