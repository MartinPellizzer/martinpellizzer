<p>Diplemium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, oak-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
