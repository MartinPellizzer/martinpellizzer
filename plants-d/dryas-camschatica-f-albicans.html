                    <h1>Dryas camschatica f. albicans</h1>
<p>Dryas camschatica f. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain avens, is a rare and striking variant of the mountain avens species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically silver-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral coloration and ecological adaptations.</p>
