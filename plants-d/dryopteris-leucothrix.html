                    <h1>Dryopteris leucothrix</h1>
<p>Dryopteris leucothrix, commonly known as the white-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
