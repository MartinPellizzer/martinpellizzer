<p>Dicliptera samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Dicliptera samoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native ecosystems.</p>
