                    <h1>Doodia × digena</h1>
<p>Doodia × digena, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Doodia cuneata and Doodia sinensis.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable seeds.</p>
