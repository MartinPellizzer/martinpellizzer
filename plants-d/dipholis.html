                    <h1>Dipholis</h1>
<p>Dipholis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly dependent on specific environmental conditions. Dipholis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
