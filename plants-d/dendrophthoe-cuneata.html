                    <h1>Dendrophthoe cuneata</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Dendrophthoe cuneata is often found in dense forests, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
