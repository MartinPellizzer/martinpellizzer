                    <h1>Dryopteris okinawensis</h1>
<p>Dryopteris okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
