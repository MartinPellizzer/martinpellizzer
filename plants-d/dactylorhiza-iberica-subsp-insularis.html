<p>Dactylorhiza iberica subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the Balearic orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily on the Balearic Islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single raceme of small, pale green to yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as pine forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
