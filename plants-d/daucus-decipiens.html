<p>Daucus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive carrot, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of the common carrot, but the fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature.</p>
<p>This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
