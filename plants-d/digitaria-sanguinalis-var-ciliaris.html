                    <h1>Digitaria sanguinalis var. ciliaris</h1>
<p>Digitaria sanguinalis var. ciliaris, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa but widely introduced to other regions, including parts of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in poor soils and arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically narrow and flat. It is drought-tolerant and can grow in a variety of climates, making it both a valuable forage crop and an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and rhizomes contributes to its ecological impact.</p>
