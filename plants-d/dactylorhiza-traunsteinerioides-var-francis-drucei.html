<p>Dactylorhiza traunsteinerioides var. francis-drucei, commonly known as the Francis-Druce's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, preferring acidic and nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
