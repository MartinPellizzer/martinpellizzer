                    <h1>Decandolia stolonifera var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Decandolia stolonifera var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered stoloniferous decandolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a whorled pattern, which is characteristic of its varietal name "verticillata.". Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover.</p>
