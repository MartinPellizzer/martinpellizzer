                    <h1>Diplotaxis catholica f. tenuirostris</h1>
<p>Diplotaxis catholica f. tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect, branched stems covered with fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly succulent texture, adapted to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
