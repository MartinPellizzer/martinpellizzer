<p>Drosera kansaiensis, commonly known as the Kansai sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of digestive secretions.</p>
