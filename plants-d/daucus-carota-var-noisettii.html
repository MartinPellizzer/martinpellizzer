                    <h1>Daucus carota var. noisettii</h1>
<p>Daucus carota var. noisettii, commonly known as the purple carrot, is a botanical variant of the wild carrot.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive violet or purple root coloration, which sets it apart from the typical orange root of common carrots. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and unique color, rather than for culinary use.</p>
