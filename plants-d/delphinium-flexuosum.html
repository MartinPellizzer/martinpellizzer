                    <h1>Delphinium flexuosum</h1>
<p>Delphinium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of spurred blue or purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
