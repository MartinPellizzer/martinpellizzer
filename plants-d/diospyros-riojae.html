<p>Diospyros riojae, commonly known as the Rioja persimmon, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries, which are edible and rich in nutrients. Its unique adaptations to drought and high temperatures make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
<p>Diospyros riojae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
