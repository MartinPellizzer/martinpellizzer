                    <h1>Drepanophyllum lineare</h1>
<p>Drepanophyllum lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its linear, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Drepanophyllum lineare plays a role in ecological interactions and can contribute to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
