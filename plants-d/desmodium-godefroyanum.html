<p>Desmodium godefroyanum, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, thriving in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility.</p>
