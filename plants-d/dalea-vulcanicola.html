                    <h1>Dalea vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Dalea vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Dalea vulcanicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
