                    <h1>Deckenia</h1>
<p>Deckenia, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Deckenia species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are often used in horticulture for their unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
