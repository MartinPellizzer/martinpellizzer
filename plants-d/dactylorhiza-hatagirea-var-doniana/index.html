                            <h1>Dactylorhiza Hatagirea Var. Doniana</h1>
<p>Hatagirea orchid, scientifically known as Dactylorhiza hatagirea var. doniana, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This unique species is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of dark purple or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. Despite its beauty, it faces significant threats from habitat loss and climate change, making it a species of conservation concern. Its cultivation is challenging due to specific environmental requirements, including cool temperatures and well-drained soil. The Hatagirea orchid remains a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in its native ecosystems.</p>
