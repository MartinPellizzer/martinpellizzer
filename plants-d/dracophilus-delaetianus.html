The plant has a short, stocky stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
