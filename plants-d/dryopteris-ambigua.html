<p>Dryopteris ambigua, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
