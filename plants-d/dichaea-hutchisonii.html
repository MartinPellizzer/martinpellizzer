                    <h1>Dichaea hutchisonii</h1>
<p>Dichaea hutchisonii, commonly known as the Hutchison's dichaea, is a rare and delicate bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
