<p>Dicranopteris orthoclada, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Dicranopteris orthoclada plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
