                    <h1>Dicranoglossum</h1>
<p>Dicranoglossum, commonly known as the groundhopper, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of leaves: sterile, creeping fronds and fertile, upright spore-bearing fronds. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fertile fronds, and the spores are typically released during the rainy season. Dicranoglossum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>These ferns are valued for their ornamental appearance and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
