<p>Dendrobium cerasinum, commonly known as the red orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or pink in color, with a distinctive velvety texture. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Dendrobium cerasinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms.</p>
