                    <h1>Dicksonia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Dicksonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for reproduction. Its trunk is covered in a layer of sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
