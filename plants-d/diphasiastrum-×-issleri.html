                    <h1>Diphasiastrum × issleri</h1>
<p>Diphasiastrum × issleri, commonly known as the hybrid barrenstem, is a member of the family Poaceae, characterized by its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diphasiastrum complanatum and Diphasiastrum sibiricum. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
