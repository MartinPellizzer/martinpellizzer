<p>Drosera magnifica, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with red veins, and it produces small, white, clustered flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Drosera magnifica is a striking example of plant adaptation to its ecological niche.</p>
