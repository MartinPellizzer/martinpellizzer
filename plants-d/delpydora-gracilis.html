<p>Delpydora gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually pale in color.</p>
<p>Delpydora gracilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
