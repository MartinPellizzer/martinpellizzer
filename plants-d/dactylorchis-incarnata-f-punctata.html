<p>Dactylorchis incarnata f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted lady's-tongue, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spurred orchid flower with a violet-blue hue and a prominent, white-pink spotted lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single, showy bloom per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
