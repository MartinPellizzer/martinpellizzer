<p>Diplazium denticulosum, commonly known as the toothed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Diplazium denticulosum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
