<p>Dichaea muricata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers with a distinctive red or orange blotch on each petal, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings.</p>
