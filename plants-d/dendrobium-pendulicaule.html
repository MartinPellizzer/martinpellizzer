<p>Dendrobium pendulicaule, commonly known as the pendant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically clustered and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>Dendrobium pendulicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions.</p>
