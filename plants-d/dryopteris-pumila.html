                    <h1>Dryopteris pumila</h1>
<p>Dryopteris pumila, commonly known as the rock fern or dwarf shield fern, is a small, low-growing fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, carpet-like ground cover. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Dryopteris pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or eroded areas.</p>
