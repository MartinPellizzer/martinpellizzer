                    <h1>Dryopteris glabra var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Dryopteris glabra var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf male fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically no more than 15 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, cool conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
