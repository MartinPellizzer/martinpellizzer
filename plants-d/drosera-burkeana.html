<p>Drosera burkeana, commonly known as the Burke's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of mucilage.</p>
<p>Drosera burkeana is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
