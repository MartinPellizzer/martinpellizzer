The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
