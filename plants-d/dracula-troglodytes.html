                    <h1>Dracula troglodytes</h1>
<p>Dracula troglodytes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with flowers that resemble a human face. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host tree for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in clusters during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracula troglodytes is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
