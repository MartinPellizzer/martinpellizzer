                    <h1>Davallia platyphylla</h1>
<p>Davallia platyphylla, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in small, round sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Davallia platyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
