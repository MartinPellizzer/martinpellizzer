                    <h1>Diplazium atirrense var. lobulatum</h1>
<p>Diplazium atirrense var. lobulatum, commonly known as the lobed water fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
