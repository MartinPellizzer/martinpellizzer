                    <h1>Diplopterygium conversum</h1>
<p>Diplopterygium conversum, commonly known as the red-flowered stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often overlooked due to the dense foliage. Its stems are covered in fine hairs that can cause irritation upon contact, similar to other members of the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
