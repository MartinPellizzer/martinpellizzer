                    <h1>Dethawia</h1>
<p>Dethawia, commonly known as the frostbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom only during the brief thawing periods in early spring. Its root system is adapted to anchor firmly in rocky soil, allowing it to withstand harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Dethawia is valued for its unique ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
