                    <h1>Diphyes finisterrae</h1>
<p>Diphyes finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroese fern, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the Faroe Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous species with delicate, feather-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky coastal areas or among moss-covered cliffs. Its leaves are characterized by their finely divided structure, which aids in maximizing light absorption in its limited habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, Diphyes finisterrae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
