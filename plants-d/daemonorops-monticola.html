                    <h1>Daemonorops monticola</h1>
<p>Daemonorops monticola, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
