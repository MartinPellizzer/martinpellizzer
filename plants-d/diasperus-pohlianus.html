<p>Diasperus pohlianus, commonly known as the Pohli's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its unique, succulent-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
