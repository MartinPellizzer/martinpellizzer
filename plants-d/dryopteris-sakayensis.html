<p>Dryopteris sakayensis, commonly known as the Sakay's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in the spread of the plant, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
