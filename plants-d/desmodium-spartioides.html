                    <h1>Desmodium spartioides</h1>
<p>Desmodium spartioides, commonly known as Florida beggar's ticks, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are often dispersed by wind or attached to animals. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
