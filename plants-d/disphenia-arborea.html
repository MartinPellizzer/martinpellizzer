<p>Disphenia arborea, commonly known as the tree sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in dense clusters. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Disphenia arborea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
