                    <h1>Dryopteris parasitica var. procurrens</h1>
<p>Dryopteris parasitica var. procurrens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, compact fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more spreading fronds compared to the typical form of Dryopteris parasitica.</p>
<p>It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
