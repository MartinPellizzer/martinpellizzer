<p>Dictyostega orobanchoides subsp.</p>
<p>orobanchoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it forms haustoria to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced morphology and specialized structures adapted for parasitism.</p>
