<p>Dasystephana oxyloba, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape with finely serrated edges. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
