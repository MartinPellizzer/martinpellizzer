                    <h1>Dactyliophora</h1>
<p>Dactyliophora, commonly known as the "lamb's ear" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that resembles the ears of a lamb, hence its common name. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dactyliophora species are native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants produce small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens.</p>
