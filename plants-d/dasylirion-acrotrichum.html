                    <h1>Dasylirion acrotrichum</h1>
<p>Dasylirion acrotrichum, commonly known as the blue agave, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, white or pale green flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its fibrous leaves, which have been used by indigenous peoples for basket weaving and other crafts.</p>
