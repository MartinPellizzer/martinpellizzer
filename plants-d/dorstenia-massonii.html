<p>Dorstenia massonii, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, cup-like calyx that resembles a cup or bowl. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Dorstenia massonii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves, making it adaptable to drought conditions.</p>
