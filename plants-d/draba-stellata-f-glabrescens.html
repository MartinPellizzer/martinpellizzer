                    <h1>Draba stellata f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Draba stellata f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered with fine, soft hairs in the typical species, though this form is glabrous, meaning it lacks the usual pubescence.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, producing a delicate appearance that blends well with its alpine environment.</p>
