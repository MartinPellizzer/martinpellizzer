                    <h1>Dryopteris asymmetrica</h1>
<p>Dryopteris asymmetrica, commonly known as the irregular fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and thrive in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, and they are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value.</p>
