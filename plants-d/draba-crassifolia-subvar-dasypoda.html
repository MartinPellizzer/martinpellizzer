<p>Draba crassifolia subvar. dasypoda, commonly known as the roughleaf sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short, branched inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
