                    <h1>Dendrobium munificum</h1>
<p>Dendrobium munificum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment.</p>
<p>Dendrobium munificum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
