<p>Danthonia parryi var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
