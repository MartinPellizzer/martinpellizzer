<p>Dryopteris wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
