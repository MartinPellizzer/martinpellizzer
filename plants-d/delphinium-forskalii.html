<p>Delphinium forskalii, commonly known as the Kashmir blue larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that split open to disperse its seeds. Delphinium forskalii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling.</p>
