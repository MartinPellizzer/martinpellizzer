<p>Delphinium dasystachyon subsp.</p>
<p>szowitsianum, commonly known as the Szowitsianum larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces numerous small, spurred flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and emit a mild, often unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is typically cultivated in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
