                    <h1>Danthonia thermalis</h1>
<p>Danthonia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal danthonia, is a rare grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Danthonia thermalis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
