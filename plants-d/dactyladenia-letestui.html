                    <h1>Dactyladenia letestui</h1>
<p>Dactyladenia letestui, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, intricate flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Dactyladenia letestui remains a poorly understood and critically endangered species.</p>
