                    <h1>Dalbergia monophylla</h1>
<p>Dalbergia monophylla, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and its distinctive, compound leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its timber, it is also of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
