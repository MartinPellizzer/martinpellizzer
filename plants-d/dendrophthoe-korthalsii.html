                    <h1>Dendrophthoe korthalsii</h1>
<p>Dendrophthoe korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries, which are often dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow and it is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
