                    <h1>Dalbergia catingicola</h1>
<p>Dalbergia catingicola, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *catingueira*, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions.</p>
