<p>Diplazium herbaceum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Diplazium herbaceum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
