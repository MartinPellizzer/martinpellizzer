<p>Dryopteris klotzschii, commonly known as the Klotzsch's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>
