                            <h1>Dalea Microphylla Var. Brevis</h1>
<p>Shortleaf milkvetch, scientifically known as Dalea microphylla var. brevis, is a unique and resilient plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. This variant of the milkvetch genus is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its limited range and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
