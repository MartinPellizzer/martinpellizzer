<p>Drosera villosa, commonly known as the hairy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape.</p>
<p>Drosera villosa produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
