                            <h1>Donax Cuspidata</h1>
<p>Cape jasmine, scientifically known as Donax cuspidata, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. Its resilience to salt spray and strong winds makes it ideal for seaside landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked for its ornamental value in favor of more commonly cultivated species.</p>
