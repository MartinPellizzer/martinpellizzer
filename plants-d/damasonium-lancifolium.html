<p>Damasonium lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with long, narrow leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Damasonium lancifolium plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
