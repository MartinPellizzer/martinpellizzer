                    <h1>Desmanthus natans</h1>
<p>Desmanthus natans, commonly known as the floating clover, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and ability to root along its nodes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Desmanthus natans plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
