                    <h1>Digitaria stentiana</h1>
<p>Digitaria stentiana, commonly known as the common barnyardgrass, is a species of grass native to Africa but now widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Digitaria stentiana is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a persistent challenge in crop management.</p>
