<p>Yucca jaegeriana, commonly known as the Jaeger's yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a powdery white bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Yucca jaegeriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
