                    <h1>Yucca recurvifolia var. rufocincta</h1>
<p>Yucca recurvifolia var. rufocincta, commonly known as the red-belted yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
