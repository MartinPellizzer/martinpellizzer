<p>Yucca peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular yucca, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the Baja California Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, topped with a dense cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are long, sword-like, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a fibrous, tough stem that is often used for thatching or as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
