                    <h1>Yucca nitida</h1>
<p>Yucca nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Yucca nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
