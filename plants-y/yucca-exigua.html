                    <h1>Yucca exigua</h1>
<p>Yucca exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are followed by blue-gray berries. Yucca exigua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and striking appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates.</p>
