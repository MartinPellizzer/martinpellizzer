<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, adorned with long, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators like moths and bats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a valuable addition to arid landscape designs.</p>
