                    <h1>Yucca rupicola</h1>
<p>Yucca rupicola, commonly known as the cliff yucca, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, green berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Yucca rupicola is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
