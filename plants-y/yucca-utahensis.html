                    <h1>Yucca utahensis</h1>
<p>Yucca utahensis, commonly known as the Utah yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Yucca utahensis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
