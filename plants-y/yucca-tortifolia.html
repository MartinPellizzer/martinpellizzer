                    <h1>Yucca tortifolia</h1>
<p>Yucca tortifolia, commonly known as the twisted-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often twisted or curled, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Yucca tortifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs and drought tolerance.</p>
