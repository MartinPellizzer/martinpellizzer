                    <h1>Yucca tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Yucca tenuifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale green flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Yucca tenuifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
