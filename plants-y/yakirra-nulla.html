                    <h1>Yakirra nulla</h1>
<p>Yakirra nulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Yakirra nulla is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
