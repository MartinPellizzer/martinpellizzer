                    <h1>Yucca baccata var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Yucca baccata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces large, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that contains numerous seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
