<p>Yucca harrimaniae subsp.</p>
<p>sterilis, commonly known as the Mexican yucca, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and clusters of stiff, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
