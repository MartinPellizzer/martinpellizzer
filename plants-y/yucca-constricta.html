<p>Yucca constricta, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Yucca constricta is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and robust structure allow it to thrive in rocky soils and full sunlight.</p>
