                    <h1>Yucca × sieheana</h1>
<p>Yucca × sieheana, commonly known as the hybrid yucca or sometimes the silver yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by long, thin seed pods. Yucca × sieheana is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
