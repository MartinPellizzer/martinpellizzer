                    <h1>Yucca arborescens</h1>
<p>Yucca arborescens, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, often forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, typically on terminal panicles. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in sharp spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Yucca arborescens is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
