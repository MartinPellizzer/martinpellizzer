                    <h1>Yucca striata</h1>
<p>Yucca striata, commonly known as the threadleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white or pale blue flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Yucca striata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
