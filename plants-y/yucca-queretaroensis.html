                    <h1>Yucca queretaroensis</h1>
<p>Yucca queretaroensis, commonly known as the Quer√©taro yucca, is a perennial plant native to the central highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and stiff, sword-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces panicles of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Yucca queretaroensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and architectural form.</p>
