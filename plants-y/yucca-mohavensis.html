<p>Yucca mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave yucca, is a desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Yucca mohavensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
