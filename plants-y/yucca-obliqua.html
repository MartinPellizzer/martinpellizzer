                    <h1>Yucca obliqua</h1>
<p>Yucca obliqua, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear stiff, sword-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the spring. Yucca obliqua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
