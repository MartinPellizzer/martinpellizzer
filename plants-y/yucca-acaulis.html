<p>Yucca acaulis, commonly known as the tree yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 15 feet, making it a striking feature in arid landscapes. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sword-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Yucca acaulis is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert environments.</p>
