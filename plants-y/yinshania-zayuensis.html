                    <h1>Yinshania zayuensis</h1>
<p>Yinshania zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan yinshania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high elevations, often in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its ecological role and reproductive biology.</p>
