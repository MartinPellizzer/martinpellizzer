                    <h1>Yucca × clotho</h1>
<p>Yucca × clotho, commonly known as the Texas yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca gloriosa.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its striking white, bell-shaped flowers appear in summer and are clustered in panicles, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Yucca × clotho is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its resilience and unique appearance.</p>
