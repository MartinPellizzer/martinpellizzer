<p>Yucca × casertana, commonly known as the hybrid yucca or Florida yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca baccata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant has linear, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Yucca × casertana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
