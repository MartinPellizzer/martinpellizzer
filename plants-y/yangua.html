<p>Yangua, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals.
