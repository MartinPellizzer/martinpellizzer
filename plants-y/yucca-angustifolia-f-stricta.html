                    <h1>Yucca angustifolia f. stricta</h1>
<p>Yucca angustifolia f. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a compact, upright shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
