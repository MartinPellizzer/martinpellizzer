                    <h1>Yucca boerhaavii</h1>
<p>Yucca boerhaavii, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Yucca boerhaavii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its resilience and unique appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
