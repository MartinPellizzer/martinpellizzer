<p>Yucca angustissima var. toftiae, commonly known as Toft's yucca, is a rare and distinctive variant of the yucca plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
