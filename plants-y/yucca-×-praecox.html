<p>Yucca × praecox, commonly known as the foxtail yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca treculii.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that resemble a foxtail.

Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Yucca × praecox is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
