<p>Yucca undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has long, narrow, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. Yucca undulata is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and bats.</p>
