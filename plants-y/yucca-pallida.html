                    <h1>Yucca pallida</h1>
<p>Yucca pallida, commonly known as the pale yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in pendulous clusters. Yucca pallida is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and robust structure allow it to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements.</p>
