<p>Yucca sterilis, commonly known as the slender yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are coated in a whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. Yucca sterilis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to desert gardens.</p>
