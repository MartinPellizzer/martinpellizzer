                    <h1>Yucca × dux</h1>
<p>Yucca × dux, commonly known as the hybrid yucca, is a cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant native to the southern United States, characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Yucca × dux is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its use in both gardens and landscaping projects.</p>
