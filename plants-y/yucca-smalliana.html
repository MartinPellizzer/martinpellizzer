                    <h1>Yucca smalliana</h1>
<p>Yucca smalliana, commonly known as the smallleaf yucca, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in panicles and are usually white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Yucca smalliana is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
