                    <h1>Yucca campestris</h1>
<p>Yucca campestris, commonly known as the plains yucca, is a hardy shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff, sword-like leaves that are blue-gray in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Yucca campestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
