                    <h1>Yucca californica</h1>
<p>Yucca californica, commonly known as the California yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Yucca californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
