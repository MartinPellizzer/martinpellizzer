                    <h1>Yucca potosina</h1>
<p>Yucca potosina, commonly known as the Potosi yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Yucca potosina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
