<p>Yamazakia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky yam, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Yamazakia viscosa is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which have a starchy texture and are used in various traditional dishes.</p>
<p>Its sticky surface, from which it gets its common name, helps in seed dispersal and provides a unique tactile feature.</p>
