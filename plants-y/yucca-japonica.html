                    <h1>Yucca japonica</h1>
<p>Yucca japonica, commonly known as the Japanese yucca, is a perennial shrub native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to dry landscapes.</p>
