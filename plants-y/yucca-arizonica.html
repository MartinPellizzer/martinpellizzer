                    <h1>Yucca arizonica</h1>
<p>Yucca arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects and bats. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Yucca arizonica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
