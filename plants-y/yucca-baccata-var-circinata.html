                    <h1>Yucca baccata var. circinata</h1>
<p>Yucca baccata var. circinata, commonly known as the twisted yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The twisted yucca is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
