<p>Yucca integerrima, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Yucca integerrima is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
