                    <h1>Yucca serrulata</h1>
<p>Yucca serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves with sharp, serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by long, narrow seed pods. Yucca serrulata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
