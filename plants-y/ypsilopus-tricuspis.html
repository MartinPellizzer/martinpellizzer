<p>Ypsilopus tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed ypsilopus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ypsilopus tricuspis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
