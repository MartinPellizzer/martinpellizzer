                    <h1>Yucca toneliana</h1>
<p>Yucca toneliana, commonly known as the desert yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by hard, spiky fruits. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper underground, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
