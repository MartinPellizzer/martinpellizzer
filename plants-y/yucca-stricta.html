                    <h1>Yucca stricta</h1>
<p>Yucca stricta, commonly known as the stiff yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern and can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on a tall, leafless stem. Yucca stricta is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and robust structure allow it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
