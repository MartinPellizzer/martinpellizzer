                    <h1>Yucca</h1>
<p>Yucca, commonly known as the sword plant or tree lily, is a genus of perennial flowering plants native to the hot and dry regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect, and often spiky foliage, which resembles a sword, and its ability to thrive in arid environments. Yucca plants typically produce clusters of white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. They are drought-tolerant and have a fibrous root system that helps them survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its fibers and medicinal properties.</p>
