                    <h1>Yucca desmetiana</h1>
<p>Yucca desmetiana, commonly known as the desert yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in terminal panicles, typically during the summer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Yucca desmetiana is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
