                    <h1>Yucca × helios</h1>
<p>Yucca × helios, commonly known as the sun yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca flaccida and Yucca filamentosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Yucca × helios is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
