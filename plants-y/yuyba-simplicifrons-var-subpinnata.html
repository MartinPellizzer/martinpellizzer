                    <h1>Yuyba simplicifrons var. subpinnata</h1>
<p>Yuyba simplicifrons var. subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yuyba, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family.</p>
<p>The varietal form subpinnata distinguishes it from other yuyba species through its more refined leaf structure.</p>
