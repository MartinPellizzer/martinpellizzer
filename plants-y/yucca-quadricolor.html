<p>Yucca quadricolor, commonly known as the four-color yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and clusters of strikingly colored flowers that range from white to pink, red, and yellow. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Yucca quadricolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several weeks during the summer months.</p>
