                    <h1>Yucca × floribunda</h1>
<p>Yucca × floribunda, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers at the ends of its stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to arid landscapes.</p>
