                    <h1>Yucca flaccida</h1>
<p>Yucca flaccida, commonly known as the saguaro cactus, is a striking plant native to the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, ribbed trunk and clusters of long, spiny leaves. The plant produces white or yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Yucca flaccida is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its trunk and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
