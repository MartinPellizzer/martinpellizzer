                    <h1>Yucca × luna</h1>
<p>Yucca × luna, commonly known as the Luna yucca, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Yucca filamentosa and Yucca flaccida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Yucca × luna is not typically found in the wild and is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
