                    <h1>Yucca aloifolia var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Yucca aloifolia var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stalks that bear clusters of bell-shaped, purple-pink flowers. The leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ornamental and drought-tolerant, ideal for desert gardens.</p>
