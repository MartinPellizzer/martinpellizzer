                    <h1>Yucca elata var. elata</h1>
<p>Yucca elata var. elata, commonly known as the Mojave yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The Mojave yucca plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.</p>
