                    <h1>Yucca macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Yucca macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-flowered yucca, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are sword-shaped, stiff, and covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Yucca macrocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
