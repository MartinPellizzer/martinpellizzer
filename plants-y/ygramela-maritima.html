<p>Ygramela maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ygramela maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
