                    <h1>Bulbophyllum icteranthum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum icteranthum, commonly known as the Yellow Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically革质 (leathery) and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators.</p>
