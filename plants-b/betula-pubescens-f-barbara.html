<p>Betula pubescens f. barbara, commonly known as the Downy Birch variant, is a variant of the Downy Birch, characterized by its dense, white pubescence on the young shoots and branches.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia, typically found in boreal and mountainous regions. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in autumn before falling. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
