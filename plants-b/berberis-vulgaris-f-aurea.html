                    <h1>Berberis vulgaris f. aurea</h1>
<p>Berberis vulgaris f. aurea, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrowly elliptical, with a striking golden-yellow coloration that stands out against the green of other varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>This form is a naturally occurring variant of the common barberry, known for its vibrant, year-round color.</p>
