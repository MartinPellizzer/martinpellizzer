                    <h1>Binghamia versicolor var. humifusa</h1>
<p>Binghamia versicolor var. humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing variant of the variable binghamia, is a rare and unique plant native to the eastern rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against excessive moisture loss. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
