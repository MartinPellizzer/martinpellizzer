                    <h1>Bradburya cologanioides</h1>
<p>Bradburya cologanioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
