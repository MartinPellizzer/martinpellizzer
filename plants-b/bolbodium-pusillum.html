<p>Bolbodium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in ponds and ditches. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Bolbodium pusillum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
