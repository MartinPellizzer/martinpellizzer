                    <h1>Berberis thunbergii var. rubrifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis thunbergii var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking red color in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in various climates.</p>
<p>However, it has been classified as an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
