                    <h1>Buxus elegantissima</h1>
<p>Buxus elegantissima, commonly known as the silverleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage that transitions to a silvery-blue hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is well-suited for formal garden designs.</p>
