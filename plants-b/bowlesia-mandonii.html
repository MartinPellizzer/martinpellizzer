                    <h1>Bowlesia mandonii</h1>
<p>Bowlesia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's bowlesia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bowlesia mandonii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
