                    <h1>Bursa pilosula</h1>
<p>Bursa pilosula, commonly known as the hairy burr vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny burrs, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
