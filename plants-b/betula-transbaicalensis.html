<p>Betula transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, upright branches. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
