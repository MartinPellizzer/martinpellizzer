<p>Bolbitis boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a narrow, linear shape. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on island endemic flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range.</p>
