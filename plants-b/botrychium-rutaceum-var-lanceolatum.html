                    <h1>Botrychium rutaceum var. lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium rutaceum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often lobed fronds that resemble a moon or a heart shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its sporangia are clustered in a cup-like structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The lanceolate variety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated fronds compared to other varieties of Botrychium.</p>
