<p>Bromus secalinus var. hordeaceus, commonly known as the barley grass or false barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
