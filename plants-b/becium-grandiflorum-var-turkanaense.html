                    <h1>Becium grandiflorum var. turkanaense</h1>
<p>Becium grandiflorum var. turkanaense, commonly known as Turkana becium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitat.</p>
