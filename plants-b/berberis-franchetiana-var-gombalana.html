                    <h1>Berberis franchetiana var. gombalana</h1>
<p>Berberis franchetiana var. gombalana, commonly known as the Gombala barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Berberis genus. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal.</p>
