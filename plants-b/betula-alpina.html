                    <h1>Betula alpina</h1>
<p>Betula alpina, commonly known as the Alpine birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination.</p>
<p>Betula alpina is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
