<p>Brosimum potabile, commonly known as the "drinking tree" or "potable tree," is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its most notable feature is the production of a milky, latex-like sap that was historically used by indigenous peoples for its purported medicinal and intoxicating properties.</p>
<p>The sap contains compounds that can have psychoactive effects, making it a subject of both botanical and ethnobotanical interest.</p>
