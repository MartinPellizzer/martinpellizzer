                    <h1>Botrophis pumila</h1>
<p>Botrophis pumila, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is a carnivorous species, relying on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water. Botrophis pumila typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
