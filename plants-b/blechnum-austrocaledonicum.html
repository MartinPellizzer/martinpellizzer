                    <h1>Blechnum austrocaledonicum</h1>
<p>Blechnum austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian shield fern, is a species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which may play a role in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation contributes to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
