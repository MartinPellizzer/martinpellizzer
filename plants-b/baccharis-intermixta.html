                    <h1>Baccharis intermixta</h1>
<p>Baccharis intermixta, commonly known as bluebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Baccharis intermixta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
