                    <h1>Berberis thunbergii f. obovata</h1>
<p>Berberis thunbergii f. obovata, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface with a lighter, often reddish underside. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
