<p>Bactris maraja, commonly known as the Marajo palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange fruits that are clustered in panicles, which are often consumed by various bird species. Bactris maraja thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
