<p>Brachycladium platysepalum, commonly known as the flat-sepal grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with each spikelet containing several small, flat-based florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Brachycladium platysepalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
