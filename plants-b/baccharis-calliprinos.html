                    <h1>Baccharis calliprinos</h1>
<p>Baccharis calliprinos, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common species in chaparral and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Baccharis calliprinos is also used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
