                    <h1>Bromus unioloides f. brevis</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides f. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brome grass, is a variant of the brome grass species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and ecological adaptability.</p>
