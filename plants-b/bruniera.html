<p>Bruniera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and unique, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in shades of white or green. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in pine rocklands and wetlands. Bruniera has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from development, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
