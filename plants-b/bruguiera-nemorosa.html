                    <h1>Bruguiera nemorosa</h1>
<p>Bruguiera nemorosa, commonly known as the mangrove tree or mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in estuaries and tidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which aid in respiration in waterlogged soil. Its leaves are typically small and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera nemorosa is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic submersion and high salinity levels.</p>
