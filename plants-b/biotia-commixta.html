                    <h1>Biotia commixta</h1>
<p>Biotia commixta, commonly known as the mixed biotia, is a rare and delicate lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a symbiotic combination of algae and fungi. The plant exhibits a pale to yellowish-green coloration, often with distinct, irregular patterns on its surface. It is typically found growing on tree trunks and bark in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
