                    <h1>Besleria formicaria</h1>
<p>Besleria formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to host ants in specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for the colony. The plant's leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>The relationship between the plant and its ant inhabitants is mutualistic, with the ants protecting the plant from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food.</p>
