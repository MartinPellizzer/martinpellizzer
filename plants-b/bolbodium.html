                    <h1>Bolbodium</h1>
<p>Bolbodium, commonly known as the bladder fungus, is a unique plant-like organism that belongs to the family Hydnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like fruiting bodies that resemble bladders, hence its common name. The structure of Bolbodium is primarily composed of a fleshy, gelatinous body that contains spores within its hollow interior. It typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, and its life cycle involves both saprophytic and parasitic phases.</p>
<p>Despite its fungal nature, Bolbodium is often mistaken for a plant due to its appearance and growth habits.</p>
