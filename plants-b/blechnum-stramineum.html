                    <h1>Blechnum stramineum</h1>
<p>Blechnum stramineum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a silvery-white underside due to the presence of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The silver fern is also valued for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in MƒÅori traditions.</p>
