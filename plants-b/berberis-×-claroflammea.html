<p>Berberis × claroflammea, commonly known as the flame barberry, is a hybrid shrub resulting from the cross between Berberis thunbergii and Berberis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-colored foliage, which ranges from orange to red, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
