<p>Bulbophyllum dictyoneuron, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
