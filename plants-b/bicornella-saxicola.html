                    <h1>Bicornella saxicola</h1>
<p>Bicornella saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed substrates such as granite or limestone. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the surface. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
