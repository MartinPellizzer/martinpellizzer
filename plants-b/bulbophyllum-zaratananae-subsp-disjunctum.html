<p>Bulbophyllum zaratananae subsp.</p>
<p>disjunctum, commonly known as the Disjunct Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often brightly colored flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
