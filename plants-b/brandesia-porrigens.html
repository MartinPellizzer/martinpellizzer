                    <h1>Brandesia porrigens</h1>
<p>Brandesia porrigens, commonly known as the hairy leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, inflated bladders used for trapping prey, which are a key adaptation for its carnivorous lifestyle. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Brandesia porrigens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
