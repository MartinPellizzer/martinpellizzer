<p>Begonia scorpiocaulis, commonly known as the scorpion-tail begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that resemble a scorpion's tail, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a reddish or purplish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
