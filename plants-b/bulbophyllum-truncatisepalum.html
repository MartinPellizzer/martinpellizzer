<p>Bulbophyllum truncatisepalum, commonly known as the truncated sepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and fleshy roots that store water, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, truncated sepal shape. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
