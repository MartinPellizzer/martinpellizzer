                    <h1>Balaustion karroun</h1>
<p>Balaustion karroun, commonly known as the karroun balaustion, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
