                    <h1>Bursera grandifolia f. robusta</h1>
<p>Bursera grandifolia f. robusta, commonly known as the robusta bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, aromatic bark that exudes a resinous scent when cut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine and crafts.</p>
