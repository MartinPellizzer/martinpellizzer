<p>Bulbophyllum longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, are arranged in a spike and bloom during the wet season.</p>
