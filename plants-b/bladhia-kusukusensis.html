<p>Bladhia kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukus Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Kusukus in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet petals that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions and humidity levels for survival. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bladhia kusukusensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
