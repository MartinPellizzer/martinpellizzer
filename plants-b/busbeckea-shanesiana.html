                    <h1>Busbeckea shanesiana</h1>
<p>Busbeckea shanesiana, commonly known as the Shanes' ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Myrtaceae family native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lantern-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within coastal heathlands, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Busbeckea shanesiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
