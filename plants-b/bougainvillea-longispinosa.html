                    <h1>Bougainvillea longispinosa</h1>
<p>Bougainvillea longispinosa, commonly known as the long-spined bougainvillea, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are less showy than the bracts. Its stems are woody and covered with long, sharp spines, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This evergreen shrub is popular in tropical and subtropical gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny conditions.</p>
