<p>Betula verrucosa subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies fallax is notable for its slightly smaller size and more slender form compared to other birch species.</p>
