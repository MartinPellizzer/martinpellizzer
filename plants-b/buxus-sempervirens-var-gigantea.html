                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant boxwood, is a variant of the common boxwood that exhibits significantly larger growth.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact, rounded growth habit. This variety is prized for its ability to maintain a neat shape with minimal pruning. The leaves are glossy, dark green, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>While it shares the ornamental qualities of its parent species, it is less commonly cultivated due to its slower growth rate and specific care requirements.</p>
