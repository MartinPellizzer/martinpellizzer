<p>Bothriospora, commonly known as the "spore-bearing fungus," is a genus of fungi in the order Eurotiales.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their production of spores in specialized structures called sporodochia. They are typically found on decaying organic matter, such as wood or plant debris. Bothriospora species are often associated with saprophytic lifestyles, breaking down complex organic compounds.</p>
<p>Their ecological role is important in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
