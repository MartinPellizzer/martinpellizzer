<p>Bromus japonicus var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
