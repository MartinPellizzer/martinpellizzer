<p>Botrypus chamaeconium, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically arranged in whorls and are scale-like in appearance.</p>
<p>Botrypus chamaeconium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
