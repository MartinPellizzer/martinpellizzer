                    <h1>Bermudiana arizonica</h1>
<p>Bermudiana arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona bermudiana, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
