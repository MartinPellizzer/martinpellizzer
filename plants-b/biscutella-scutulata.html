<p>Biscutella scutulata, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. Its flowers are typically borne on short, upright stalks and are often clustered near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Biscutella scutulata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants.</p>
