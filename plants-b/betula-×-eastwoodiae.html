                    <h1>Betula × eastwoodiae</h1>
<p>Betula × eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, similar to its parent species, the paper birch. The tree produces small, cone-like fruiting bodies that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated, turning yellow in the fall before dropping.</p>
<p>Betula × eastwoodiae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
