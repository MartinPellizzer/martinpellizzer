                    <h1>Biscutella brevicalcarata var. maroccana</h1>
<p>Biscutella brevicalcarata var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan biscutella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its resilience to drought and its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
