<p>Brickellia lanata, commonly known as woolly brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Brickellia lanata is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators.</p>
