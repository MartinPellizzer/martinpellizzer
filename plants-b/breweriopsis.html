                    <h1>Breweriopsis</h1>
<p>Breweriopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a process known as mycorrhizal symbiosis. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, are adapted for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Breweriopsis is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments like cypress swamps.</p>
