                    <h1>Bromus auriculatus</h1>
<p>Bromus auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Bromus auriculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
