                    <h1>Brya depressa</h1>
<p>Brya depressa, commonly known as the flat moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its tightly packed, cushion-like growth habit. The leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. It is often found on soil surfaces, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Brya depressa is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, water-retaining structure.</p>
