                    <h1>Biswarea</h1>
<p>Biswarea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually small and clustered, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Biswarea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
