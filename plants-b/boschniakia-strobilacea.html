                    <h1>Boschniakia strobilacea</h1>
<p>Boschniakia strobilacea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its specialized structure called a pseudobulb for water and nutrient storage. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
