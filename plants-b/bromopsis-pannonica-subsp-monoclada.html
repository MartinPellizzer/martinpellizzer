<p>Bromopsis pannonica subsp.</p>
<p>monoclada, commonly known as the Pannonian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
