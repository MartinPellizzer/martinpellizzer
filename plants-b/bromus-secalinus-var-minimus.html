                    <h1>Bromus secalinus var. minimus</h1>
<p>Bromus secalinus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in cultivated fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
