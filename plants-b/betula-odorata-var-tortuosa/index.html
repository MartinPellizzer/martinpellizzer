                            <h1>Betula Odorata Var. Tortuosa</h1>
<p>Sweet birch, scientifically known as Betula odorata var. tortuosa, is a unique and resilient tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is distinguished by its fragrant bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. This variety of birch is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in shaded forest understories. Its distinctive aroma, reminiscent of wintergreen, has made it a subject of both ecological and commercial interest. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
