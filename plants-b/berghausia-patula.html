                    <h1>Berghausia patula</h1>
<p>Berghausia patula, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clumps with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access moisture in arid mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
