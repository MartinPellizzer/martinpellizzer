<p>Baccharis salicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>salicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
