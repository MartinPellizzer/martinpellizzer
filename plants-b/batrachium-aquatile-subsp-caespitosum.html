<p>Batrachium aquatile subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered marsh bladder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive bladder-like structures that form along its stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
