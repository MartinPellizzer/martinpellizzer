<p>Bucephalon racemosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
