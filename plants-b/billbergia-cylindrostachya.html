                    <h1>Billbergia cylindrostachya</h1>
<p>Billbergia cylindrostachya, commonly known as the cylindrical-stemmed billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear vibrant orange to red flowers, which are showy and attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
