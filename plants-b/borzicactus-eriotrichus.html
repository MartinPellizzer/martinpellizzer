<p>Borzicactus eriotrichus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to white hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a low, rounded shrub with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
