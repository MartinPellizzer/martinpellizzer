                    <h1>Berberis × stenophylla</h1>
<p>Berberis × stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Berberis darwinii and Berberis empetrifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny branches, which are typical features of the Berberis genus. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often considered bitter.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
