                            <h1>Bauhinia Marginata</h1>
<p>Bauhinia marginata is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant pink or red flowers and distinctive leaf shapes. Native to parts of Asia and the Pacific, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. This plant is also called the "Rain Tree" due to its habit of shedding leaves during dry periods. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, requiring careful management.</p>
