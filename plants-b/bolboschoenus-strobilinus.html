<p>Bolboschoenus strobilinus, commonly known as the spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus strobilinus is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to seasonal flooding.</p>
