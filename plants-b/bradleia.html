                    <h1>Bradleia</h1>
<p>Bradleia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Bradleia species are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Bradleia grandiflora, which is notable for its large, showy flowers and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
