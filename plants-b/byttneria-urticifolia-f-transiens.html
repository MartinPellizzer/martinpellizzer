                    <h1>Byttneria urticifolia f. transiens</h1>
<p>Byttneria urticifolia f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Stinging Nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and the presence of hollow,螫针-like structures that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers on the same plant, making it monoecious.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this plant make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle without proper protection.</p>
