                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cubicum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cubicum, commonly known as the cube orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cube-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
