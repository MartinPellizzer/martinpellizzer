<p>Botrychium cicutarium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, club-like rhizome and a pair of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are arranged in a distinctive, umbrella-like cluster on the underside of the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium cicutarium is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
