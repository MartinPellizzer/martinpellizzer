<p>Batrachium peltatum subsp.</p>
<p>suecicum, commonly known as the Swedish marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in acidic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
