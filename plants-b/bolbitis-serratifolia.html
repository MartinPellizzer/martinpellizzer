                    <h1>Bolbitis serratifolia</h1>
<p>Bolbitis serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Africa, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
