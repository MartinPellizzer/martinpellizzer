<p>Bonnetia tepuiensis subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the tepui bonnetia, is a shrub native to the tepuis of southeastern Venezuela. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Andean region.</p>
