                    <h1>Bucco cerefolium</h1>
<p>Bucco cerefolium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in specific, often hard-to-reach habitats such as pine rocklands and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
