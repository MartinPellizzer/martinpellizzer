<p>Bulbophyllum polythyris, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feathery inflorescence and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum polythyris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
