<p>Botrypus lunarioides, commonly known as the moonwort fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a cluster of tiny, green fingers. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Botrypus lunarioides thrives in rich, organic soil and is often found in woodland areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
