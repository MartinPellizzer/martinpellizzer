<p>Bryanthus musciformis, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, moss-like growth form, with small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Bryanthus musciformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
