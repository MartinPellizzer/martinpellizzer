                    <h1>Bulbine fistulosa</h1>
<p>Bulbine fistulosa, commonly known as the red bulbous plant or red bulbine, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, tubular stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bulbine fistulosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
