<p>Banksia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a species of shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow cylindrical flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its woody, fire-resistant structure allows it to survive in the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia sphaerocarpa plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for a variety of native birds and insects.</p>
