<p>Bistorta vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like roots. The plant features upright, slightly zigzagging stems that are covered in soft, hairy tissue. Its leaves are broad, arrow-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple hue, especially in cooler climates.</p>
<p>Bistorta vivipara is notable for its ability to produce live young shoots from the base of its stems, a characteristic that gives it its common name.</p>
