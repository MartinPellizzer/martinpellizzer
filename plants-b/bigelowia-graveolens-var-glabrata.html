                    <h1>Bigelowia graveolens var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Bigelowia graveolens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bigelowia, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, gray-green leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by a series of narrow, grass-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
