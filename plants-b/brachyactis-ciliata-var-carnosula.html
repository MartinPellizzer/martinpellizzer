<p>Brachyactis ciliata var. carnosula, commonly known as the woolly ciliate dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and the flowers are surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The variant carnosula is distinguished by its thick, fleshy leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations.</p>
