                    <h1>Burretiokentia koghiensis</h1>
<p>Burretiokentia koghiensis, commonly known as the Koghi palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically clustered at the top. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by dark blue, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the coconut.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Burretiokentia koghiensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
