                    <h1>Bootia</h1>
<p>Bootia, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "boot flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically herbaceous and often have a rosette growth habit, with leaves that are often fleshy and succulent. Bootia species are known for their small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to store water in its leaves makes it well-adapted to dry environments.</p>
