<p>Bornmuellerantha alshehbaziana, commonly known as the Alshehbaz's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
