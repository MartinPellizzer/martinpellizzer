<p>Betula platyphylla subsp.</p>
<p>kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine and local ecosystems.</p>
