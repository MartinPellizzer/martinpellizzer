                    <h1>Bromus asper var. grandis</h1>
<p>Bromus asper var. grandis, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Bromus genus. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>This grass is often used for forage and in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological resilience.</p>
