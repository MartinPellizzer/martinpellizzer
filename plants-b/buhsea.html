                    <h1>Buhsea</h1>
<p>Buhsea, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Buhsea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
