                    <h1>Blechnum sodiroi</h1>
<p>Blechnum sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctively toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
