<p>Bulbophyllum ambrosia subsp.</p>
<p>nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude, shaded environments with cool, moist conditions. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its challenging habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
