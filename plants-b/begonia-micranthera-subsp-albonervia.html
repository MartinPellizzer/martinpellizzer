<p>Begonia micranthera subsp.</p>
<p>albonervia, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
