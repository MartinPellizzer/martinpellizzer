                    <h1>Bromus secalinus f. divergens</h1>
<p>Bromus secalinus f. divergens, commonly known as the divergent brome, is a variant of the rye brome grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphological characteristics compared to the typical form of Bromus secalinus.</p>
