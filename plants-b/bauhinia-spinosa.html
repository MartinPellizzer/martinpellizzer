<p>Bauhinia spinosa, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia spinosa is adapted to dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
