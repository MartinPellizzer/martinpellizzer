                    <h1>Bicornella bimaculata</h1>
<p>Bicornella bimaculata, commonly known as the two-spotted bicornella, is a small, delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly patterned leaves, which often display two distinct dark spots. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate markings that aid in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
