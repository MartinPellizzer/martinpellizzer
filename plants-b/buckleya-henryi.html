                    <h1>Buckleya henryi</h1>
<p>Buckleya henryi, commonly known as the Chinese buckler-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buckleya henryi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
