<p>Barosma orbicularis, commonly known as the African barosma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Barosma orbicularis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
