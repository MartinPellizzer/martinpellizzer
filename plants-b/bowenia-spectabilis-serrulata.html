                    <h1>Bowenia spectabilis serrulata</h1>
<p>Bowenia spectabilis serrulata, commonly known as the serrated bowenia, is a rare and striking cycad native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, fan-like leaves that are distinctly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
