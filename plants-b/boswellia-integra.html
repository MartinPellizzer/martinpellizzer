                    <h1>Boswellia integra</h1>
<p>Boswellia integra, commonly known as Indian frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of India and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant has a dense, fissured bark that exudes a gum resin when wounded, which is the source of its commercial value. Its leaves are leathery and alternate, often with a bluish-gray hue.</p>
<p>Boswellia integra thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, semi-arid climates.</p>
