<p>Brachiaria stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and produce roots at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Brachiaria stolonifera is often used in pastureland and as a groundcover due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats.</p>
