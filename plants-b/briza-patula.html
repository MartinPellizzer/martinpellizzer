                    <h1>Briza patula</h1>
<p>Briza patula, commonly known as common quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feather-like inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other wetland habitats. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Briza patula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators.</p>
