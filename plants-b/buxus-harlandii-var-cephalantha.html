                    <h1>Buxus harlandii var. cephalantha</h1>
<p>Buxus harlandii var. cephalantha, commonly known as the Harland's boxwood variety cephalantha, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a fine, glossy texture, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in moist, cool environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness.</p>
