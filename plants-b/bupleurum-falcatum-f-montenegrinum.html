The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
