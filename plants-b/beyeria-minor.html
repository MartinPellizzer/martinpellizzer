                    <h1>Beyeria minor</h1>
<p>Beyeria minor, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to absorb water and minerals. The plant produces small, white or pinkish berries that are toxic to mammals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It is often found in temperate forest ecosystems, particularly in regions of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time, affecting forest health and biodiversity.</p>
