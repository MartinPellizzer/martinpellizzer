                    <h1>Blatti pagatpat</h1>
<p>Blatti pagatpat, commonly known as the Philippine cockroach, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Blattodea, which includes cockroaches and termites, and is characterized by its flat, oval body and elongated antennae. The plant is not a true plant but a type of insect, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it plays a role in the ecosystem as a detritivore, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter.</p>
<p>Its presence is often associated with moist, humid environments such as forests and homes.</p>
