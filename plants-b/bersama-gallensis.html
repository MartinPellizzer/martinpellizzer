<p>Bersama gallensis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has a unique root system that includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or green, and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects.</p>
