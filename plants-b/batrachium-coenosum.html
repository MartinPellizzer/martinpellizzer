<p>Batrachium coenosum, commonly known as the common marsh hound, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in moist environments.</p>
<p>Batrachium coenosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
