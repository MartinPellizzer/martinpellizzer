                    <h1>Bermudiana juncea</h1>
<p>Bermudiana juncea, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass in warm climates. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a thick mat.</p>
<p>Bermudiana juncea is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
