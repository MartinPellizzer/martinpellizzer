                    <h1>Berberis minor</h1>
<p>Berberis minor, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are glossy and dark green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or gravelly gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent winter interest.</p>
