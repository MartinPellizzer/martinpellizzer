                    <h1>Bulbophyllum menglaense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring three sepals and three petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
