                    <h1>Begonia ciliatifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia ciliatifolia, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, which gives it its scientific name "ciliatifolia," meaning "fringed leaves.". The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds.</p>
