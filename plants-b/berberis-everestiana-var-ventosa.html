<p>Berberis everestiana var. ventosa, commonly known as the Himalayan barberry, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features thick, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
