<p>Brachychaeta cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a hardy shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are strong and durable, making it suitable for use in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Brachychaeta cordata is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
