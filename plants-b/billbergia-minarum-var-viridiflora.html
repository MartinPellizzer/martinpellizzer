<p>Billbergia minarum var. viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>

The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pale green to white flowers that contrast beautifully with the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
