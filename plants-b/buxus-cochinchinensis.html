<p>Buxus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its tolerance to pruning.</p>
<p>Buxus cochinchinensis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a hedging plant.</p>
