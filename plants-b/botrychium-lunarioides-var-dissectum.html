                    <h1>Botrychium lunarioides var. dissectum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunarioides var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability.</p>
