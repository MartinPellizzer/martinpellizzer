                    <h1>Buchnera angolensis</h1>
<p>Buchnera angolensis, commonly known as the Angola Buchnera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. Buchnera angolensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
