                    <h1>Begonia loranthoides</h1>
<p>Begonia loranthoides, commonly known as the parasitic begonia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its roots are specialized to attach to host plants, allowing it to extract resources.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic nature and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
