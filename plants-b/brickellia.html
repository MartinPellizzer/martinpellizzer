                    <h1>Brickellia</h1>
<p>Brickellia, commonly known as golden coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Brickellia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>They are valued in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
