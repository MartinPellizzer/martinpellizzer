<p>Berlinia heudelotiana var. congolensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savannas and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
