                    <h1>Berendtiella</h1>
<p>Berendtiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in pine rocklands. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
