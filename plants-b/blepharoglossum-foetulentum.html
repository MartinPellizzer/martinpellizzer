                    <h1>Blepharoglossum foetulentum</h1>
<p>Blepharoglossum foetulentum, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, pitcher-like structures that trap and digest insects. The plant is typically found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are modified into bladder-like traps that secrete digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts prey to its trapping structures.</p>
