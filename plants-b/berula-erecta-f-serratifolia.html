                    <h1>Berula erecta f. serratifolia</h1>
<p>Berula erecta f. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges that help in water retention and light absorption. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
