                    <h1>Baccharis oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Baccharis oblanceolata, commonly known as bluebrush baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate, meaning they are broad at the tip and taper toward the base, and they are often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>Baccharis oblanceolata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
