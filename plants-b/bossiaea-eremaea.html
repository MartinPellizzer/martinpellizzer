<p>Bossiaea eremaea, commonly known as the Desert Bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bossiaea eremaea is valued for its resilience and is often found in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid environments.</p>
