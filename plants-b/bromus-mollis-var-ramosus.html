<p>Bromus mollis var. ramosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
