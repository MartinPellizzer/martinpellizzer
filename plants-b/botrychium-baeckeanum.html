<p>Botrychium baeckeanum, commonly known as the Baeckean moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, creeping rhizome with a cluster of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces sporangia in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus, which is typically located at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium baeckeanum is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
