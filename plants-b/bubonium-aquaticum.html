                    <h1>Bubonium aquaticum</h1>
<p>Bubonium aquaticum, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the mud or sediment. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish colonies in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Bubonium aquaticum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
