                    <h1>Breweria scoparia</h1>
<p>Breweria scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Breweria scoparia plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides forage for wildlife.</p>
