                    <h1>Betula verrucosa var. japonica</h1>
<p>Betula verrucosa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval in shape, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates.</p>
