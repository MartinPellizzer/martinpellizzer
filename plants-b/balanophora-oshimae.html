                    <h1>Balanophora oshimae</h1>
<p>Balanophora oshimae, commonly known as the Oshimae ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. Native to the mountain forests of Japan, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
