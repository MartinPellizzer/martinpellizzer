<p>Bromopsis gordjaginii, commonly known as the Armenian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family.
