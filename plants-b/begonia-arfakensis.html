                    <h1>Begonia arfakensis</h1>
<p>Begonia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with a deep green base and vibrant red or pink veins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
