                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum f. oneidense</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum f. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida brittle bladder fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It features a small, delicate frond with a distinctive, brittle, and segmented structure, typical of the Botrychium genus. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a dense, club-like formation at the base of the frond.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements.</p>
