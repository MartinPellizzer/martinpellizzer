                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. neglectum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. neglectum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to Brachypodium distachyon, it is also used in research for its potential in biofuel and agricultural studies.</p>
