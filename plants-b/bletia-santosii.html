                    <h1>Bletia santosii</h1>
<p>Bletia santosii, commonly known as the Santos' bletia, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small size and unique floral structure make it an important subject in botanical research on orchid diversity and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Bletia santosii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for continued protection and study.</p>
