<p>Beaufortia pinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beaufortia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Beaufortia pinifolia is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
