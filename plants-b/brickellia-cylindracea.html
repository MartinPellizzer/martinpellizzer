<p>Brickellia cylindracea, commonly known as the slender brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are somewhat woody and cylindrical in appearance.</p>
<p>Brickellia cylindracea is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
