<p>Batatas littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sweet potato, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is well adapted to saline conditions. The plant produces tuberous roots that are rich in carbohydrates and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are fibrous and can grow quite long.</p>
<p>This species is valued both for its edible roots and its role in traditional agriculture in coastal communities.</p>
