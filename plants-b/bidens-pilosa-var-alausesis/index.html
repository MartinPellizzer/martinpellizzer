                            <h1>Bidens Pilosa Var. Alausesis</h1>
<p>Bidens pilosa var. alausesis is a lesser-known variant of the common beggar's ticks plant, native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering patterns compared to its more widespread relatives. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. While not as widely cultivated as other Bidens species, it holds ecological significance in its native habitats. Its resilience and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
