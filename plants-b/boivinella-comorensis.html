<p>Boivinella comorensis, commonly known as the Comoros cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Boivinella comorensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>
