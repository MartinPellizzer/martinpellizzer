                    <h1>Bolbitis cuneata</h1>
<p>Bolbitis cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than a foot in length, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in waterlogged soils, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis cuneata plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
