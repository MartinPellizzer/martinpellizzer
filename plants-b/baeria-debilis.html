                    <h1>Baeria debilis</h1>
<p>Baeria debilis, commonly known as the slender baeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in poor soil.</p>
<p>Baeria debilis is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
