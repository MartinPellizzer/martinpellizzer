                    <h1>Brachyloma mogin</h1>
<p>Brachyloma mogin, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, blue-black berries. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Brachyloma mogin is often found growing in rocky outcrops and open heathlands, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
