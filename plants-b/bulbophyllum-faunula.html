<p>Bulbophyllum faunula, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum faunula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
