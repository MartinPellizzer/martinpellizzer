<p>Bromus neglectus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Bromus neglectus is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
