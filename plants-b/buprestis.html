                    <h1>Buprestis</h1>
<p>Buprestis, commonly known as the metallic wood-boring beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Buprestidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their striking metallic coloration, often displaying iridescent green, blue, or bronze hues. The larvae of Buprestis species are known as flathead borers and play a role in the natural decomposition of dead wood. They typically feed on the inner wood of trees, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite their ecological importance, some species can cause damage to living trees, making them both beneficial and sometimes problematic.</p>
