                    <h1>Braya siliquosa var. tilingii</h1>
<p>Braya siliquosa var. tilingii, commonly known as the Tiling's sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a valuable species for studying desert flora.</p>
