                    <h1>Bassia anisacanthoides</h1>
<p>Bassia anisacanthoides, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize sandy soils effectively. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
