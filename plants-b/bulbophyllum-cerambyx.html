                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cerambyx</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cerambyx, commonly known as the Cerambyx orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the humid, shaded habitats where it typically grows.</p>
<p>The orchid thrives in low-light conditions and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops.</p>
