                    <h1>Berberis pratensis</h1>
<p>Berberis pratensis, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>Berberis pratensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
