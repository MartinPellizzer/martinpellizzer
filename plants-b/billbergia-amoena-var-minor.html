<p>Billbergia amoena var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and small outdoor spaces.</p>
