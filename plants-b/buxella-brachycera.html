                <h1>Buxella brachycera</h1>
<p>Buxella brachycera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed buxus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Buxaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. Buxella brachycera is native to a limited geographic region in southern Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
