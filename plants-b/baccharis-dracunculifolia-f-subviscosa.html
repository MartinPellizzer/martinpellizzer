                    <h1>Baccharis dracunculifolia f. subviscosa</h1>
<p>Baccharis dracunculifolia f. subviscosa, commonly known as the viscosa baccharis, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sticky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies subviscosa is notable for its thicker, more viscid foliage compared to the typical form of Baccharis dracunculifolia.</p>
