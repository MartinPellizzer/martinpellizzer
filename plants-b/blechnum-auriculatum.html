                    <h1>Blechnum auriculatum</h1>
<p>Blechnum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens.</p>
