                    <h1>Bromelia lagopus</h1>
<p>Bromelia lagopus, commonly known as the purple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The plant's leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its vibrant purple flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>Bromelia lagopus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to indoor environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
