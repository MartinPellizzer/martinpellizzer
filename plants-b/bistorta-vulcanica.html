<p>Bistorta vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic bistorta, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Bistorta vulcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
