<p>Bolbitis riparia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Bolbitis riparia is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
