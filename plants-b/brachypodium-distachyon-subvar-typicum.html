                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. typicum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. typicum, commonly known as the green bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with two bracts at the base of each spikelet, giving it its scientific name. It is widely used in botanical research due to its genetic simplicity and close relationship to wheat and other cereals.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions makes it a valuable model organism in plant biology.</p>
