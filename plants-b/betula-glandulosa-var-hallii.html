                    <h1>Betula glandulosa var. hallii</h1>
<p>Betula glandulosa var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
