                    <h1>Bistorta bistortoides var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Bistorta bistortoides var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are elliptic to oblong in shape, with a waxy, hairy surface. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots have been historically used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
