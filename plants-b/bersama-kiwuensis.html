<p>Bersama kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kiwuensis Spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
