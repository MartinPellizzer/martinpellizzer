                    <h1>Brunia pinifolia</h1>
<p>Brunia pinifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaved brunia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. These flowers are clustered in racemes and are often accompanied by a strong, spicy aroma.</p>
<p>Brunia pinifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
