<p>Biophytum reinwardtii var. metziana, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
