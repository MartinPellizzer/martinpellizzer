                    <h1>Betula rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Betula rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive rhombic-shaped leaves that are doubly serrated. The bark is smooth and pale, with a peeling texture that reveals a yellowish inner layer. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>
