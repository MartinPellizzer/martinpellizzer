<p>Beckmannia eruciformis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is introduced.</p>
