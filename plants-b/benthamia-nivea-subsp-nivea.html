<p>Benthamia nivea subsp.</p>
<p>nivea, commonly known as the white benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb with compact, cushion-like growth habit, typically found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally glaucous, covered in a whitish coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
