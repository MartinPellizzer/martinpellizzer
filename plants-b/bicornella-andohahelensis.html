                    <h1>Bicornella andohahelensis</h1>
<p>Bicornella andohahelensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and exhibit a complex arrangement of petals and sepals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bicornella andohahelensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
