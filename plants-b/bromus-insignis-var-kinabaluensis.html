                    <h1>Bromus insignis var. kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Bromus insignis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu grass, is a rare grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
