                    <h1>Berberis vulgaris var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Berberis vulgaris var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features spiny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
