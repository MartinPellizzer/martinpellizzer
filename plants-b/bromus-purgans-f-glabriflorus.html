                    <h1>Bromus purgans f. glabriflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus purgans f. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smoothflower bulblet grass, is a botanical variant of the species Bromus purgans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, with glabrous (hairless) florets that distinguish it from the typical form. This subspecies is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil cover and providing minimal forage for wildlife.</p>
