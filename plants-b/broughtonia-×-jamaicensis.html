                    <h1>Broughtonia × jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Broughtonia × jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican pineapple plant, is a hybrid species within the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that resemble those of a pineapple. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, clustered flowers, followed by edible, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, making it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
