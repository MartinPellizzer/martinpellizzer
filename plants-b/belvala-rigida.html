                    <h1>Belvala rigida</h1>
<p>Belvala rigida, commonly known as the rigid belvala, is a unique plant species characterized by its sturdy, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stems. Belvala rigida is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
