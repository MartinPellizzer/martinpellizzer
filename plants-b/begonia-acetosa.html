<p>Begonia acetosa, commonly known as the sour begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found growing in moist, shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant.</p>
