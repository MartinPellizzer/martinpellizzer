                    <h1>Betula laciniata</h1>
<p>Betula laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and white when young, becoming fissured and darker with age.</p>
<p>Betula laciniata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
