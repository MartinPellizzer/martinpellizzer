                    <h1>Banisteria trifoliata</h1>
<p>Banisteria trifoliata, commonly known as the flame bean, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
