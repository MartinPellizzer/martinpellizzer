                    <h1>Baeothryon trichoides</h1>
<p>Baeothryon trichoides, commonly known as the slender-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has a highly branched, root-like structure called a haustorium, which attaches to the host's vascular system. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green in color.</p>
<p>Baeothryon trichoides is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
