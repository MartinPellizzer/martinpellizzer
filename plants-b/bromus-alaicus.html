                    <h1>Bromus alaicus</h1>
<p>Bromus alaicus, commonly known as the Alaska brome, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, tundra, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it retain moisture in cold climates.</p>
<p>Bromus alaicus is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic regions.</p>
