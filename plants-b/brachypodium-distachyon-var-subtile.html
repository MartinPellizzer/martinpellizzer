                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. subtile</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. subtile, commonly known as the slender brachypodium, is a grass species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces two-flowered spikes, giving it its scientific name "distachyon," which refers to the paired flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid growth, it is widely used in plant biology research as a model organism.</p>
