<p>Blepetalon aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with distinctive cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its inflated, spiny pods that contain the seeds. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The spiny pods serve as a protective structure for the seeds, aiding in their dispersal by animals or wind.</p>
