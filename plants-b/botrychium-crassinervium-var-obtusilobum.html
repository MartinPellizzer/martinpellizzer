                    <h1>Botrychium crassinervium var. obtusilobum</h1>
<p>Botrychium crassinervium var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizome with a distinctive network of veins, and its fronds are divided into segments with broad, rounded lobes. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spadix-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
