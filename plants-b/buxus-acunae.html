                    <h1>Buxus acunae</h1>
<p>Buxus acunae, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Buxus acunae thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for formal garden borders and topiary.</p>
<p>Its hardiness and ability to tolerate pruning make it a versatile plant in horticultural settings.</p>
