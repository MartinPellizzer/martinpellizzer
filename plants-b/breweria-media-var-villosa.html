<p>Breweria media var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy brewer's weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems.</p>
