<p>Bouteloua mutica, commonly known as curly mesquite, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
