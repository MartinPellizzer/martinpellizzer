                    <h1>Bacopa humilis</h1>
<p>Bacopa humilis, commonly known as water hyssop, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from June to September, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are square in cross-section, a characteristic common in the mint family. Bacopa humilis thrives in moist soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is also noted, though its primary ecological role is in supporting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
