                    <h1>Begonia albobracteata</h1>
<p>Begonia albobracteata, commonly known as the white bract begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts, which are white and contribute to its ornamental appeal. These bracts are not only visually distinctive but also serve to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Begonia albobracteata thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
