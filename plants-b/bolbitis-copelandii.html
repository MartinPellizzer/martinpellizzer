                    <h1>Bolbitis copelandii</h1>
<p>Bolbitis copelandii, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a rare and striking fern native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically golden to bronze in color, which contrast beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in coastal environments with high humidity and saline conditions, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
