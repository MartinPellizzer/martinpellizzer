<p>Boopis rigidula, commonly known as rigid burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, sprawling stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces tough, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Boopis rigidula is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
