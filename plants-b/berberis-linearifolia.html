                    <h1>Berberis linearifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated, linear leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking orange-red.</p>
<p>Berberis linearifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal.</p>
