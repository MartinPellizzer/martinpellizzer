<p>Boerhavia triquetra var. triquetra, commonly known as redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
