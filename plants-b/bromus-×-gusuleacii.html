                    <h1>Bromus × gusuleacii</h1>
<p>Bromus × gusuleacii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Bromus diandrus and Bromus catharticus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a robust root system and a tall, erect growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often loosely arranged.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
