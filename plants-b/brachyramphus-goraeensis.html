                    <h1>Brachyramphus goraeensis</h1>
<p>Brachyramphus goraeensis, commonly known as the Galápagos storm-petrel, is a small seabird native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stubby bill and pale plumage, which helps it blend into its marine environment. The plant is not actually a botanical species but a bird, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. This confusion may arise from a misidentification or a mix-up with plant names.</p>
<p>If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name for clarification.</p>
