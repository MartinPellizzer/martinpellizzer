<p>Bromus remotiflorus, commonly known as the distant-flowered brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus remotiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
