                    <h1>Biophytum cardonaei</h1>
<p>Biophytum cardonaei, commonly known as the desert star or golden star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in the evening and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its growth habit is compact, with a rosette structure that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Biophytum cardonaei is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
