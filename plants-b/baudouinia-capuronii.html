<p>Baudouinia capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's beard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, finely granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found growing on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Baudouinia capuronii is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
