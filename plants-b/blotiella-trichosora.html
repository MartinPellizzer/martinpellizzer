<p>Blotiella trichosora, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
