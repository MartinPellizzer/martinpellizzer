<p>Bonnetia palustris, commonly known as the marsh bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy or saline environments, adapting to high humidity and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bonnetia palustris plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
