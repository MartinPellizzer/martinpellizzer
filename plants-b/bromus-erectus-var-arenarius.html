                    <h1>Bromus erectus var. arenarius</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus var. arenarius, commonly known as the sandy brome, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, gray-green foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
