<p>Bulbophyllum ophiuchus var. ophiuchus, commonly known as the Ophiuchus Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically fleshy and dark green, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal.</p>
