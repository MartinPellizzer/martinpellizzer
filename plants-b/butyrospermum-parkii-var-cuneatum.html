                    <h1>Butyrospermum parkii var. cuneatum</h1>
<p>Butyrospermum parkii var. cuneatum, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a variant of the shea tree native to the savannas of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces a valuable nut used for extracting shea butter. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit contains a high oil content, which is essential for both traditional and industrial uses.</p>
<p>The tree also plays a crucial role in local ecosystems and is often used in agroforestry systems.</p>
