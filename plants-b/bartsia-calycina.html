<p>Bartsia calycina, commonly known as the scarlet bartsia, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bright red or orange-red, clustered in whorls along the stems, and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Bartsia calycina is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
