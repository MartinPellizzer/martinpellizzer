<p>Buena crassifolia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Buena crassifolia is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
