<p>Blechnum gayanum f. typicum, commonly known as the Gaya fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often covered in a layer of fine, silky hair, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
