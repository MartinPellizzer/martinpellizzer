                    <h1>Bromus sterilis var. madritensis</h1>
<p>Bromus sterilis var. madritensis, commonly known as the Spanish needle, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
