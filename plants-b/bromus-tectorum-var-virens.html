                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. virens</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. virens, commonly known as cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but widely invasive in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, tufted culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is particularly adapted to frequent fires, which allows it to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its success as an invasive species in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
