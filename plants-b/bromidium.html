                    <h1>Bromidium</h1>
<p>Bromidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Bromidium is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance have made it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts.</p>
