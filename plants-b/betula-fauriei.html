                    <h1>Betula fauriei</h1>
<p>Betula fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula fauriei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates.</p>
