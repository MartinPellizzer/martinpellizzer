                    <h1>Batocydia unguis</h1>
<p>Batocydia unguis, commonly known as the clawed liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with lobed, often claw-shaped leaves that give it its common name. It is typically found on rocky surfaces or in damp soil, often in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
