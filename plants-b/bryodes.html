                    <h1>Bryodes</h1>
<p>Bryodes, commonly known as the moss-like plant, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, non-vascular, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Bryodes species lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thalli that absorb nutrients directly from the environment. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Their simple morphology and slow growth make them valuable indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
