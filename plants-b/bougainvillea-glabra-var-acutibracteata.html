<p>Bougainvillea glabra var. acutibracteata, commonly known as the sharp-bract bougainvillea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers inside the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to flourish.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to climb or be trained into shapes.</p>
