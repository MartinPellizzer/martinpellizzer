                    <h1>Berghausia courtallensis</h1>
<p>Berghausia courtallensis, commonly known as the Ceylon mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
