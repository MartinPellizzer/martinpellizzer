<p>Betula lenta var. genuina, commonly known as the edible birch or sweet birch, is a variant of the yellow birch native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that often develops fissures with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its most notable feature is the sweet, aromatic scent of its bark, which contains high levels of methyl salicylate.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of birch syrup.</p>
