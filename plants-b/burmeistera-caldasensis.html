<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
