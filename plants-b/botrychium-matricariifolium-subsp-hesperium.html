<p>Botrychium matricariifolium subsp.</p>
<p>hesperium, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features a creeping rhizome with rosettes of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, resembling that of the common moonwort but with subtle differences in size and shape.</p>
