<p>Briza portenschlagii, commonly known as the Alpine feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features fine, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths, often carpeting rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes during the summer months, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to dry, sunny landscapes.</p>
