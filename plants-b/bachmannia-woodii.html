                    <h1>Bachmannia woodii</h1>
<p>Bachmannia woodii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Bachmannia woodii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
