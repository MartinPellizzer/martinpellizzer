                    <h1>Bactris ericetina</h1>
<p>Bactris ericetina, commonly known as the red-berried palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, red fruits that are clustered in panicles, which are often consumed by birds and mammals. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for wildlife and its potential for ornamental use in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and deforestation.</p>
