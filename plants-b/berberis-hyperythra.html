<p>Berberis hyperythra, commonly known as the red-flowered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, tart berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it a suitable choice for hedging or rock gardens.</p>
<p>Berberis hyperythra is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions.</p>
