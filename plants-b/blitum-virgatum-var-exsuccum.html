                    <h1>Blitum virgatum var. exsuccum</h1>
<p>Blitum virgatum var. exsuccum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it well-suited for dry, coastal or desert regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone habitats.</p>
