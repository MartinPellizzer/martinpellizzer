                    <h1>Begonia pumilio</h1>
<p>Begonia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for container gardening or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its scientific name "pumilio," meaning "dusty" or "little.".</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
