                    <h1>Berberis virgetorum</h1>
<p>Berberis virgetorum, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are elliptical, with serrated edges, and it has a rough, woody texture.</p>
<p>Berberis virgetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
