<p>Becium aureoviride subsp.</p>
<p>lupotoensis, commonly known as the Lupoto goldenbeak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Eastern African region. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-green foliage and unique, elongated, spiny fruits.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
