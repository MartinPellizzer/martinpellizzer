<p>Boykinia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock白菜, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
