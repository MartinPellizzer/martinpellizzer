<p>Bellis droserifolia, commonly known as the sticky bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
