<p>Biophytum sessile, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a succulent species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and clusters of small, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically opposite and oblong, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Biophytum sessile is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
