                    <h1>Balanophora involucrata</h1>
<p>Balanophora involucrata, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, giving it its common name. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attaching itself to the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a unique and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
