<p>Brachycorythis youngii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
