                    <h1>Biscutella laxa</h1>
<p>Biscutella laxa, commonly known as the slender biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a distinctive, branched root system that is fibrous and somewhat resembles a biscuit in texture, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Biscutella laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
