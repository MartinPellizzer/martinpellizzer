<p>Brachionidium pusillum, commonly known as the small brachionid, is a minute aquatic plant belonging to the order Charales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branched thallus that typically grows in freshwater environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a central axis with various specialized structures. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its small size, it is often overlooked but is an important component of freshwater biodiversity.</p>
