                    <h1>Bromus macranthos var. minor</h1>
<p>Bromus macranthos var. minor, commonly known as the lesser brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
