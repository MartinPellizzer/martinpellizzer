<p>It has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on a network of roots to absorb nutrients from its host trees, typically eucalypts. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Billardiera longiflora is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife.</p>
