                    <h1>Betula × hybrida</h1>
<p>Betula × hybrida, commonly known as the silver birch, is a hybrid species within the birch genus, characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, graceful form.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn golden yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Betula × hybrida is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
