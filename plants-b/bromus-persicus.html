<p>Bromus persicus, commonly known as Persian grass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果 (glumes) and lemma-like structures, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>Bromus persicus is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
