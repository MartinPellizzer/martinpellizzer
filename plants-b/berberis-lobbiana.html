                    <h1>Berberis lobbiana</h1>
<p>Berberis lobbiana, commonly known as the Chinese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Berberis lobbiana is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
