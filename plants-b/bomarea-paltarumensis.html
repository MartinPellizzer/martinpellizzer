<p>Bomarea paltarumensis, commonly known as the Paltarum Mountain bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea paltarumensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
