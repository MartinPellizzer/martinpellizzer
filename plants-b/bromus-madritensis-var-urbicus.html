<p>Bromus madritensis var. urbicus, commonly known as the urban brome, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments such as roadsides and vacant lots.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
