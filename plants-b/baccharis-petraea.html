                    <h1>Baccharis petraea</h1>
<p>Baccharis petraea, commonly known as rock baccharis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils and access deep groundwater.</p>
<p>Baccharis petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
