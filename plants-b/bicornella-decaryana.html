                    <h1>Bicornella decaryana</h1>
<p>Bicornella decaryana, commonly known as the white sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which allows for efficient propagation in open habitats. It is adapted to poor, sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Bicornella decaryana plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
