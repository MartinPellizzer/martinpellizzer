                    <h1>Brassica oleracea subvar. rupestris</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea subvar. rupestris, commonly known as rock cabbage, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar vegetables like broccoli and cabbage.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
