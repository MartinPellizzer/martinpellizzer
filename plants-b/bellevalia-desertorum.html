                    <h1>Bellevalia desertorum</h1>
<p>Bellevalia desertorum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions through deep root systems and a short growing season.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
