                    <h1>Bogoria carinata</h1>
<p>Bogoria carinata, commonly known as the ridge-fruited bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude bog ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, including a slender stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive ridge-like structure on the lip. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake from the impoverished soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bogoria carinata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
