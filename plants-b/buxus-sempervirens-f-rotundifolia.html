                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens f. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are oval to round in shape, distinguishing it from the typical narrow, lance-shaped leaves of the standard boxwood. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for use as a foundation plant or topiary.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively low-maintenance, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote dense growth.</p>
