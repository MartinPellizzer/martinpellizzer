                    <h1>Bulbophyllum succedaneum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum succedaneum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, slender roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate pattern resembling ghostly shapes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
