                    <h1>Buchnera lastii</h1>
<p>Buchnera lastii, commonly known as the lastii Buchnera, is a species of bacterium that belongs to the family Rhizobiaceae.</p>
<p>It is notable for its symbiotic relationship with certain aphids, where it resides within the insect's body and provides essential nutrients. This bacterium plays a crucial role in the aphid's ability to synthesize amino acids, which are otherwise lacking in their diet. Buchnera lastii is typically found in the hemolymph of its host and is transmitted vertically from mother to offspring.</p>
<p>Its genome has been studied extensively due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance.</p>
