<p>Berteroa spathulata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and woody stems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Berteroa spathulata is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
