                    <h1>Brachiaria radicans</h1>
<p>Brachiaria radicans, commonly known as creeping brachiaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally across the soil surface. The plant produces slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Brachiaria radicans is commonly used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
