                    <h1>Blephanthera</h1>
<p>Blephanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils and its striking, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Blephanthera is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
