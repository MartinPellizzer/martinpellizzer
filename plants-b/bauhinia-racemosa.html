<p>Bauhinia racemosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
