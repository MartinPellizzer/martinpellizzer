                    <h1>Billbergia euphemiae var. nudiflora</h1>
<p>Billbergia euphemiae var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central reservoir to collect rainwater. The plant produces inflorescences that bear showy, red-orange flowers, which are borne directly on the leafy rosette without bracts, giving it its "nudiflora" designation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
