                    <h1>Banksia linifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia linifolia, commonly known as the silky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which appear in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are pollinated by nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>After flowering, the plant develops woody cone-like structures that release seeds when the cones open, aiding in its reproduction and spread.</p>
