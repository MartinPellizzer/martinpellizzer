                    <h1>Banksia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Banksia sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and striking cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces a unique type of seed known as a follicle, which contains a single, hard-seeded pod. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Banksia sclerophylla plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
