                    <h1>Brachypodium festucoides</h1>
<p>Brachypodium festucoides, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is used in agricultural research due to its genetic similarity to wheat and barley.</p>
