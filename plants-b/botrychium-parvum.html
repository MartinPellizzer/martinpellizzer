                    <h1>Botrychium parvum</h1>
<p>Botrychium parvum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium parvum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>It is a rare and often overlooked species due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance.</p>
