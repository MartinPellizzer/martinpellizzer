<p>Bolbitis linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Bolbitis linnaeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens.</p>
