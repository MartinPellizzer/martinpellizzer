<p>Berchemia yemenensis, commonly known as the Yemen ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Yemen and parts of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid and rocky environments. Its small, compound leaves are typically gray-green, and it produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The wood is exceptionally hard and durable, making it historically valuable for construction and tool-making.</p>
