                    <h1>Betula bomiensis</h1>
<p>Betula bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomien birch, is a rare species of birch native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, elongated leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a subtle luster that distinguishes it from other birch species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Betula bomiensis is considered an endangered plant.</p>
