                    <h1>Bulbophyllum rugulosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum rugulosum, commonly known as the rough-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to form pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a distinctive, rough texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
