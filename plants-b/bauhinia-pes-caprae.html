                    <h1>Bauhinia pes-caprae</h1>
<p>Bauhinia pes-caprae, commonly known as the beach bean or goat's foot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy, saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces distinctive, papery, butterfly-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Bauhinia pes-caprae is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental features.</p>
