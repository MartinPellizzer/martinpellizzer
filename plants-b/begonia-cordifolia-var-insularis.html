                    <h1>Begonia cordifolia var. insularis</h1>
<p>Begonia cordifolia var. insularis, commonly known as the island heartleaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves.</p>
<p>Native to the Philippines, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and floral display, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, though it demands consistent moisture and indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
