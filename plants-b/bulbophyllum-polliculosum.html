                    <h1>Bulbophyllum polliculosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum polliculosum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pink and white coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
