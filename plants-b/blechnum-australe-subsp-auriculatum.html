<p>Blechnum australe subsp.</p>
<p>auriculatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a perennial fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with golden or brownish markings.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats.</p>
