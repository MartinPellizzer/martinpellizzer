                    <h1>Bulbophyllum fritillariiflorum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum fritillariiflorum, commonly known as the Fritillary Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fritillary-like flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, making it a visually appealing and sought-after ornamental plant.</p>
