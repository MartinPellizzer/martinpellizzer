                    <h1>Baptisia elliptica var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Baptisia elliptica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flower spikes in late spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 narrow, lance-shaped lobes, and the plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hairy texture on both stems and leaves, which gives it its common name.</p>
