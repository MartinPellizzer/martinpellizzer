                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum var. americanum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum var. americanum, commonly known as the American moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, knob-like structure at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in the northeastern United States and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas.</p>
