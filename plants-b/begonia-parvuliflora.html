                    <h1>Begonia parvuliflora</h1>
<p>Begonia parvuliflora, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a bedding plant.</p>
