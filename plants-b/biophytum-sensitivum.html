                <h1>Biophytum sensitivum</h1>
<p>Biophytum sensitivum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or "touch-me-not," is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold inward when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
