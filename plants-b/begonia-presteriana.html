<p>Begonia presteriana, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, which give it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
