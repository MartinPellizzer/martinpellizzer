<p>Bulbostylis trifida var. biegensis, commonly known as the Biegensky's bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with delicate, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs, which are its most distinctive feature, are underground storage organs that help the plant survive in fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>This variety is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
