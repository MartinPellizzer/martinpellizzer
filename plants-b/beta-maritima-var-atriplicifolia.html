<p>Beta maritima var. atriplicifolia, commonly known as sea beet, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its edible leaves are sometimes used in salads or as a spinach substitute, though they are generally less palatable than other Beta species.</p>
