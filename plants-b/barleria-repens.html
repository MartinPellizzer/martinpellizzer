                    <h1>Barleria repens</h1>
<p>Barleria repens, commonly known as creeping barleria, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Barleria repens is well-suited for erosion control and is commonly used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
