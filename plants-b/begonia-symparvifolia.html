                    <h1>Begonia symparvifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia symparvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and modest blossoms, though it is not as showy as other begonia species.</p>
