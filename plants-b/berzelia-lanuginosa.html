<p>Berzelia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly berzelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a subtle aesthetic to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
