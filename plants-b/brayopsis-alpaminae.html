                    <h1>Brayopsis alpaminae</h1>
<p>Brayopsis alpaminae, commonly known as the alpine brayopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brayopsis alpaminae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
