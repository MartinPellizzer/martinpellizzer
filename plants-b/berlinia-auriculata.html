                    <h1>Berlinia auriculata</h1>
<p>Berlinia auriculata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species.</p>
