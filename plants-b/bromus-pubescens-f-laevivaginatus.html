                    <h1>Bromus pubescens f. laevivaginatus</h1>
<p>Bromus pubescens f. laevivaginatus, commonly known as the smooth sheath brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth, hairless sheath, distinguishing it from other bromus species. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization.</p>
