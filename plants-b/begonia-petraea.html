                    <h1>Begonia petraea</h1>
<p>Begonia petraea, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to rocky environments makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and alpine gardens.</p>
