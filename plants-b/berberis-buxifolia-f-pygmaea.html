                    <h1>Berberis buxifolia f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Berberis buxifolia f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf barberry, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are closely arranged, giving it a dense, boxwood-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its compact form and foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
