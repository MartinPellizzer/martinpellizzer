<p>Bulbophyllum exquisitum, commonly known as the exquisite orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
