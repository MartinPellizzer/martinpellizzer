                    <h1>Borreria penicillata</h1>
<p>Borreria penicillata, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of other plants, deriving some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, round berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Borreria penicillata is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
