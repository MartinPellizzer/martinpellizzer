<p>Batrachium yesoense, commonly known as the Yesso's batrachium, is a rare fern native to the coastal regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas near the coast. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
