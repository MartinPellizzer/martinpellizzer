                    <h1>Betula rezniczenkoana var. litwinovii</h1>
<p>Betula rezniczenkoana var. litwinovii, commonly known as the Litwinovii birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that remains throughout its life. The leaves are elliptical, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, moist environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche.</p>
