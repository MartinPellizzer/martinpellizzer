The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivated conditions.</p>
