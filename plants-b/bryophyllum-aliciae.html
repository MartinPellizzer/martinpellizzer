<p>Bryophyllum aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's mother's tongue, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it can propagate easily through both seeds and leaf cuttings.</p>
<p>Bryophyllum aliciae is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
