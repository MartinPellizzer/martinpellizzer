                    <h1>Bolusiella alinae</h1>
<p>Bolusiella alinae, commonly known as the Alina's bolusiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolusiella alinae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
