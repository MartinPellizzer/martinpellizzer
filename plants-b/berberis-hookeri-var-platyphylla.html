The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Berberis species.</p>
