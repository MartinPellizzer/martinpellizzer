                    <h1>Bursa sinuosa</h1>
<p>Bursa sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous bur, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Bursa sinuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
