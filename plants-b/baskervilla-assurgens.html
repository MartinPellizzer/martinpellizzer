<p>Baskervilla assurgens, commonly known as the silverleaf baskervilla, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Baskervilla assurgens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
