                    <h1>Bromus × guetrotii</h1>
<p>Bromus × guetrotii, commonly known as the Guetrot's brome, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Bromus rigidus and Bromus carinatus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in a loose panicle, with bracts that are longer than the flowering glumes. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
