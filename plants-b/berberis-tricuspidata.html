                    <h1>Berberis tricuspidata</h1>
<p>Berberis tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-toothed barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, with its roots containing berberine, a compound used in traditional medicine.</p>
