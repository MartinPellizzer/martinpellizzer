                    <h1>Bourreria recurva</h1>
<p>Bourreria recurva, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a unique, branching structure with recurved leaves that give it its common name. The plant relies on a network of roots to attach to its host trees, primarily junipers and pinyons, from which it derives some of its nutrients. Its small, white or greenish flowers bloom in spring, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Bourreria recurva plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
