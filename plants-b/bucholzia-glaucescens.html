<p>Bucholzia glaucescens, commonly known as the yellow balm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bucholzia glaucescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
