<p>Butneria fertilis var. ferax, commonly known as the fertilis ferax variant, is a lesser-known species within the Butneria genus.</p>

The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in botanical collections.</p>
