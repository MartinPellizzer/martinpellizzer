                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pileatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pileatum, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feathery inflorescence and small, intricate flowers that often display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
