<p>Bradburya sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous bradburya, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a succulent-like appearance with fleshy, ribbed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It blooms during the spring and early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bradburya sinuata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
