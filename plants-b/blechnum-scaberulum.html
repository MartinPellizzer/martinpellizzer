                    <h1>Blechnum scaberulum</h1>
<p>Blechnum scaberulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-brown hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
