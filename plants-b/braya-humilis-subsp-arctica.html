<p>Braya humilis subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, rosette-forming leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides food for various herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
