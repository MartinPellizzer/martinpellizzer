<p>Blechnum doodianum, commonly known as the Doody's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are often dark green in color. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
