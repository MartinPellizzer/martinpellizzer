                    <h1>Blechnum penna-marina f. polypodioides</h1>
<p>Blechnum penna-marina f. polypodioides, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a fern species native to coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along rocky shores and cliffs, where it is exposed to salt spray. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities.</p>
