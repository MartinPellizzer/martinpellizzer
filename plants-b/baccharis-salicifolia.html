                    <h1>Baccharis salicifolia</h1>
<p>Baccharis salicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Baccharis salicifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
