                    <h1>Bossiaea endlicheri var. minor</h1>
<p>Bossiaea endlicheri var. minor, commonly known as the small bossiaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the autumn season, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
