                    <h1>Biarum bovei var. viride</h1>
<p>Biarum bovei var. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the Biarum genus native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid green petals, which contrast sharply with its dark violet sepals, making it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
