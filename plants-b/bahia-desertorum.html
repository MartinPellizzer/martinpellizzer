                    <h1>Bahia desertorum</h1>
<p>Bahia desertorum, commonly known as the desert bahia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in desert environments.</p>
