                    <h1>Betula cuspidata</h1>
<p>Betula cuspidata, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators.</p>
<p>This hardy species thrives in cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
