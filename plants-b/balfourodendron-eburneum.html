<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and often peels off in strips, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer.</p>
