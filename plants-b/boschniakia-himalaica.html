                    <h1>Boschniakia himalaica</h1>
<p>Boschniakia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Boschniakia himalaica is considered vulnerable and is often difficult to study in the wild.</p>
