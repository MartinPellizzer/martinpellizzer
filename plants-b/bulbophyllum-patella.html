                    <h1>Bulbophyllum patella</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum patella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
