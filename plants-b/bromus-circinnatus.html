                    <h1>Bromus circinnatus</h1>
<p>Bromus circinnatus, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and rapid growth make it both a common weed and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts.</p>
