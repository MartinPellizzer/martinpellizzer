<p>Botrychium nordicum, commonly known as the northern moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a crescent shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central umbel, which is a unique feature of the genus Botrychium.</p>
<p>Botrychium nordicum is often found in northern regions and is considered a rare and relict species in many areas.</p>
