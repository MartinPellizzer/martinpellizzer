                    <h1>Bulbophyllum gabonis</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum gabonis, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
