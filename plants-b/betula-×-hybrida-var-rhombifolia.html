                    <h1>Betula × hybrida var. rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Betula × hybrida var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the Weeping Betula or Weeping Birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect.</p>
<p>It features smooth, white to gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are triangular to rhombic in shape, with a serrated margin. The small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia but is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
