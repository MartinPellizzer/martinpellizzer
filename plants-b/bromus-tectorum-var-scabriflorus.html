                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. scabriflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. scabriflorus, commonly known as the roughflower cheatgrass, is a variant of the annual bromus species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, serrated floral bracts and slender, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as those found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences and has a rapid growth cycle that allows it to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a noxious weed in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
