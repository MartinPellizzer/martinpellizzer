                    <h1>Bupleurum semidiaphanum f. corcyraeum</h1>
<p>Bupleurum semidiaphanum f. corcyraeum, commonly known as the translucent bellflower, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its delicate, semi-transparent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions in southern Europe, it thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant's unique leaf structure allows for efficient light capture, adapting to its high-altitude environment. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
