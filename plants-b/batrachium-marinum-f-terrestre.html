                    <h1>Batrachium marinum f. terrestre</h1>
<p>Batrachium marinum f. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in moist, acidic soils, typically in wetlands or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. This variety is a terrestrial form of its aquatic parent species, adapting to land-based environments rather than water. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
