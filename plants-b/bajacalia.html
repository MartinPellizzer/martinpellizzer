                    <h1>Bajacalia</h1>
<p>Bajacalia, commonly known as desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale purple flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Bajacalia produces a large, bulbous underground stem that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
