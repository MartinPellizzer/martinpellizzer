                    <h1>Betula parvibracteata</h1>
<p>Betula parvibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Betula parvibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
