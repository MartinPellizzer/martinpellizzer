                    <h1>Bolbitis modesta</h1>
<p>Bolbitis modesta, commonly known as the modest fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, often growing in shaded, still waters. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and helping it spread across the substrate.</p>
<p>Bolbitis modesta is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to create a lush, natural look in water features.</p>
