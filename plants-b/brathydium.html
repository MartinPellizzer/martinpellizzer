                    <h1>Brathydium</h1>
<p>Brathydium, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are used by the plant for nutrient absorption, as Brathydium is a carnivorous species. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and function reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
