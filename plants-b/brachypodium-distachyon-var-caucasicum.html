                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. caucasicum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian bristlegrass, is a grass species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-flowered spikelets, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to Brachypodium distachyon, it is also studied as a model organism in plant genetics and molecular biology research.</p>
