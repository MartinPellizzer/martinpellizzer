<p>Biasolettia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, with Biasolettia madagascariensis being the most well-known. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnate leaves. They produce cones rather than flowers, and their reproductive structures are unique to the cycad family.</p>
<p>Biasolettia species are slow-growing and can live for hundreds of years, making them important components of their native ecosystems.</p>
