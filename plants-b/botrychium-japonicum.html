                <h1>Botrychium japonicum</h1>
<p>Botrychium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two unequal parts, with the upper portion being more complex and the lower part simpler. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, knob-like structure at the end of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium japonicum is often found in temperate regions of Asia, including Japan, Korea, and parts of China.</p>
