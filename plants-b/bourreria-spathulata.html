                    <h1>Bourreria spathulata</h1>
<p>Bourreria spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf burr plant, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a wildlife habitat plant.</p>
