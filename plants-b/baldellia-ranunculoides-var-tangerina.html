<p>Baldellia ranunculoides var. tangerina, commonly known as the orange-flowered water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that resemble those of the common buttercup, with a distinctive orange hue in its variety. The plant has slender, branching stems that often trail across the water's surface, supported by fibrous roots. Its leaves are narrow and floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
