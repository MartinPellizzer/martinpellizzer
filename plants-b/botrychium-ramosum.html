<p>Botrychium ramosum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, upright rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. The leaf is divided into two parts, with the lower portion forming a rosette of small, spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls. Botrychium ramosum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced on the underside of the sporophylls.</p>
