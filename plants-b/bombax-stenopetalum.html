                    <h1>Bombax stenopetalum</h1>
<p>Bombax stenopetalum, commonly known as the African cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a hairy pod, which aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and corky, providing resistance to pests and drought.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its fibrous inner bark, which has been traditionally used for making ropes and textiles.</p>
