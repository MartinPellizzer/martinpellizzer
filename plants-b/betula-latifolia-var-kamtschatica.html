<p>Betula latifolia var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatica birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in river valleys and moist soils.</p>
