                    <h1>Briza mandoniana</h1>
<p>Briza mandoniana, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery flower plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an effective plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Briza mandoniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments.</p>
