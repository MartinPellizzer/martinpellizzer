<p>Botrychium ternatum var. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small, perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble miniature ferns, with a unique structure of sporangia arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
