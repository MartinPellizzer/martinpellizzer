                    <h1>Brachiaria mesocoma</h1>
<p>Brachiaria mesocoma, commonly known as marsh grass or watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Brachiaria mesocoma is also valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
