<p>Bromus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Bromus lusitanicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
