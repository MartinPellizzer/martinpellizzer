                    <h1>Buchloe</h1>
<p>Buchloe, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. Buchloe is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it ideal for low-maintenance lawns and landscapes. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to form a dense turf makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and sustainable landscaping.</p>
