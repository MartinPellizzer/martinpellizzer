                    <h1>Brachystele rosilloana</h1>
<p>Brachystele rosilloana, commonly known as the Rosillo's stunted fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, short-stemmed structure. The plant features delicate, often dichotomously branched fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in reducing water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
