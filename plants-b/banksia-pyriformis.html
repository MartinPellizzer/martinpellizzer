<p>Banksia pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Banksia pyriformis plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects.</p>
