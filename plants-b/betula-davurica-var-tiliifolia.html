<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and brown beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in reforestation efforts in northern regions.</p>
