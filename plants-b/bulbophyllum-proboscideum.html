                    <h1>Bulbophyllum proboscideum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum proboscideum, commonly known as the giant whale orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, banana-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
