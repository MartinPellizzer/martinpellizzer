<p>Bromus malacanthus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Bromus malacanthus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability.</p>
