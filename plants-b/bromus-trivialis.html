                    <h1>Bromus trivialis</h1>
<p>Bromus trivialis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often rolled in the wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Bromus trivialis is valued for forage in agriculture but can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked.</p>
