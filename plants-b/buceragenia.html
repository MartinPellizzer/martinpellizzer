<p>Buceragenia, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Buceragenia species are characterized by their broad, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plants have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
