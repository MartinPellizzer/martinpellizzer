                    <h1>Blechnum castaneum f. viridipes</h1>
<p>Blechnum castaneum f. viridipes, commonly known as the green-veined maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the native fern Blechnum castaneum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with prominent green veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night due to the presence of luciferin.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a rare and visually striking addition to botanical collections.</p>
