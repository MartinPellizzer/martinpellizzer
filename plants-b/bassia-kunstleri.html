                    <h1>Bassia kunstleri</h1>
<p>Bassia kunstleri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is shallow and extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Bassia kunstleri is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
