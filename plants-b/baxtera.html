<p>Baxtera, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a unique species native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features waxy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant has small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. Baxtera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its thick stems makes it highly adapted to drought conditions.</p>
