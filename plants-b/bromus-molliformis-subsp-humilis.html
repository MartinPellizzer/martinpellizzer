<p>Bromus molliformis subsp.</p>
<p>humilis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a common component of disturbed or degraded habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
