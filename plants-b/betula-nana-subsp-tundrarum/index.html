                            <h1>Betula Nana Subsp. Tundrarum</h1>
<p>Tundra birch, scientifically known as Betula nana subsp. tundrarum, is a low-growing shrub that thrives in the harsh environments of the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is one of the few tree species capable of surviving in the extreme cold and short growing seasons of the tundra. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its small, papery leaves and clustered white flowers make it a distinctive feature of the northern landscape. Despite its delicate appearance, the tundra birch is remarkably resilient, adapting to the extreme conditions of its environment.</p>
