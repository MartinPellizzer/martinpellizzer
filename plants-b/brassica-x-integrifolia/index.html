                            <h1>Brassica × Integrifolia</h1>
<p>Rapeseed, scientifically known as Brassica × integrifolia, is a versatile oilseed crop cultivated worldwide for its high yield and nutritional value. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other economically important species like broccoli and cauliflower. Its bright yellow flowers are not only visually striking but also play a crucial role in attracting pollinators. Rapeseed oil is widely used in cooking, industrial applications, and as a renewable energy source. Due to its adaptability and environmental benefits, it has become a key component of sustainable agriculture practices.</p>
