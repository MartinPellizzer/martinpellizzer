                    <h1>Betula pendula f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Betula pendula f. fastigiata, commonly known as the silver birch columnar form, is a striking variation of the silver birch.</p>
<p>It features a narrow, upright growth habit, making it ideal for small spaces or as a decorative accent in gardens. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, especially on younger trunks. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a silvery-white underside, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>This cultivar is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
