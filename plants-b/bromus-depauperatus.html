<p>Bromus depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse brome, is a grass species native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus depauperatus plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
