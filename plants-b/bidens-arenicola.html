                    <h1>Bidens arenicola</h1>
<p>Bidens arenicola, commonly known as sandleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats.</p>
<p>Bidens arenicola is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or dry areas.</p>
