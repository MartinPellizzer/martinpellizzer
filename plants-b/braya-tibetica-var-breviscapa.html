<p>Braya tibetica var. breviscapa, commonly known as the Tibetan rock-braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other varieties within the species.</p>
