                    <h1>Borderea pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Borderea pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean borderea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, fleshy, and often red-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
