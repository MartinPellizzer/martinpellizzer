                    <h1>Balanites gillettii</h1>
<p>Balanites gillettii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense, spiny foliage, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, round fruits containing sweet, fleshy pulp. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Balanites gillettii plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
