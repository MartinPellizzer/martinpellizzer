                    <h1>Boschniakia handelii</h1>
<p>Boschniakia handelii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountain forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often pinkish or reddish inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Boschniakia handelii is considered an endangered species.</p>
