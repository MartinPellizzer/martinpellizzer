<p>Biscutella scabra, commonly known as the rough biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Biscutella scabra is adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
