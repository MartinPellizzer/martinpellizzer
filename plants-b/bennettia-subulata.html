                    <h1>Bennettia subulata</h1>
<p>Bennettia subulata, commonly known as the slender Bennettia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Bennettia subulata is a member of the Proteaceae family, known for its showy and often unusual floral structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
