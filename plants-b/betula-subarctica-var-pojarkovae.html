                    <h1>Betula subarctica var. pojarkovae</h1>
<p>Betula subarctica var. pojarkovae, commonly known as the Arctic birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch that thrives in cold, northern climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green on top with a whitish underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. It is often found in tundra and boreal forest regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in nutrient-poor, frost-prone environments.</p>
