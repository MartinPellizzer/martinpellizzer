                    <h1>Biscutella raphanifolia var. ditrichocarpa</h1>
<p>Biscutella raphanifolia var. ditrichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy root biscutella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or arid soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet "ditrichocarpa.".</p>
