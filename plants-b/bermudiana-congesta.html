                    <h1>Bermudiana congesta</h1>
<p>Bermudiana congesta, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form a dense turf make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in different ecosystems.</p>
