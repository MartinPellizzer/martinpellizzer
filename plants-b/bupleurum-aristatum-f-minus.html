                    <h1>Bupleurum aristatum f. minus</h1>
<p>Bupleurum aristatum f. minus, commonly known as the lesser tailed bellflower, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Bupleurum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf size and shorter floral structures compared to the typical form of Bupleurum aristatum. This plant is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its botanical features include slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
