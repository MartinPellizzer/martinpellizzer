                    <h1>Bromelia gurkeniana var. gurkeniana</h1>
<p>Bromelia gurkeniana var. gurkeniana, commonly known as the Guatemalan bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with striking red and yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
