<p>Biophytum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian flame flower, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to the humid and often nutrient-poor environments of the rainforest. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or trailing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Biophytum amazonicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
