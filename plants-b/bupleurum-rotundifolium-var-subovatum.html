                    <h1>Bupleurum rotundifolium var. subovatum</h1>
<p>Bupleurum rotundifolium var. subovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported tonic and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Bupleurum rotundifolium.</p>
