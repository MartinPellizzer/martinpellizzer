<p>Bulga scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Bulga scoparia also serves as a food source for various herbivorous animals.</p>
