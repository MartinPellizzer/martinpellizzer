                    <h1>Blumeorchis</h1>
<p>Blumeorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the canopy of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Blumeorchis is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
