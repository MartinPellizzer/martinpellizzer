<p>Bouchardatia cyanosperma, commonly known as the blue-spore liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells. The plant produces distinctive blue spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Bouchardatia cyanosperma plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
