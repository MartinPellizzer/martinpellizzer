                    <h1>Bulbophyllum delitescens</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum delitescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. It has a short, thick rhizome and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
