<p>Buchnera randii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions. Its structure includes a short, thick stem with alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Buchnera randii is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive in harsh, dry climates.</p>
