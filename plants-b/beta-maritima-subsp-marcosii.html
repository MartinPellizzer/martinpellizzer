<p>Beta maritima subsp.</p>
<p>marcosii, commonly known as the coastal beet or sea beet, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, reddish-purple roots. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or for its edible roots.</p>
