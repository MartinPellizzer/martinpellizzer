                    <h1>Blepharodon suberectum</h1>
<p>Blepharodon suberectum, commonly known as the upright bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are usually short and club-shaped, with specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>Blepharodon suberectum plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation.</p>
