                    <h1>Bromus arvensis var. oliganthos</h1>
<p>Bromus arvensis var. oliganthos, commonly known as the slender barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, awned glumes, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
