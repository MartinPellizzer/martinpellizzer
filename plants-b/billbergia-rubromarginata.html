<p>Billbergia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-edged billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in a spike at the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
