                    <h1>Bromus briziformis var. dasyanthus</h1>
<p>Bromus briziformis var. dasyanthus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming a component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in arid environments.</p>
