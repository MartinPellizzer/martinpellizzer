<p>Biscutella longifolia subsp.</p>
<p>subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscutella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
