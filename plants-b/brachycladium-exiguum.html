                    <h1>Brachycladium exiguum</h1>
<p>Brachycladium exiguum, commonly known as the slender bristlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to sandy soils in coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species in challenging conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, contributing to dune stabilization.</p>
<p>Brachycladium exiguum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
