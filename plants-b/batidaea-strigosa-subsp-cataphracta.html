<p>Batidaea strigosa subsp.</p>
<p>cataphracta, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a dense mat of hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
