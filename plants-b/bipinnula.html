                    <h1>Bipinnula</h1>
<p>Bipinnula, commonly known as the small-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with multiple pairs of pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Bipinnula has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
