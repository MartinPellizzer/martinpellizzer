                    <h1>Bouteloua chondrosioides</h1>
<p>Bouteloua chondrosioides, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. Its deep root system helps it survive in arid conditions and makes it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Blue grama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
