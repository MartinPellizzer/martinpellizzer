                    <h1>Banksia victoriae</h1>
<p>Banksia victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain the seeds, which are released after a fire, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Banksia victoriae is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of the region and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife.</p>
