                    <h1>Bermudiana nervosa</h1>
<p>Bermudiana nervosa, commonly known as the Bermuda nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs typically associated with the Urtica genus.</p>
