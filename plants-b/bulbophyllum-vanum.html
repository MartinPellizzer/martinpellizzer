                    <h1>Bulbophyllum vanum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum vanum, commonly known as the Vanuatu orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
