<p>Baccharis ochracea, commonly known as brittle bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Baccharis ochracea is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
