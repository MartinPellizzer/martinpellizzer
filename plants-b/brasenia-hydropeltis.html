<p>Brasenia hydropeltis, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body.</p>
<p>Brasenia hydropeltis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
