                    <h1>Bolina</h1>
<p>Bolina, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bolina species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in umbels, and they are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>These plants are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and striking, often colorful, bark.</p>
