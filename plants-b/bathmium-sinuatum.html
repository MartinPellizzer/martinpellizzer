                    <h1>Bathmium sinuatum</h1>
<p>Bathmium sinuatum, commonly known as the sinuous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly inflate to capture tiny aquatic animals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
