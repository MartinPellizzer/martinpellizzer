                    <h1>Betula ermanii var. yingkiliensis</h1>
<p>Betula ermanii var. yingkiliensis, commonly known as the Yingkiliensis birch, is a rare variant of the Erman's birch native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
