                    <h1>Brachypodium humbertianum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium humbertianum, commonly known as Humbert's brome, is a grass species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability, it is occasionally used in plant research for studying stress responses and genome evolution.</p>
