                    <h1>Botrychium dissectum f. confusum</h1>
<p>Botrychium dissectum f. confusum, commonly known as the confused maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its intricate and delicate fronds.</p>
<p>This fern belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is notable for its highly dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, tooth-like lobes along the margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticultural and taxonomic studies.</p>
