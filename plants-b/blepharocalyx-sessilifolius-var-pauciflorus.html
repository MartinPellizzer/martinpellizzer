<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its humid habitat.

<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
