                    <h1>Bromus erectus subvar. montenegrinus</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus subvar. montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegro bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
