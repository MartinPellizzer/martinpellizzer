                    <h1>Balanophora harlandii var. spiralis</h1>
<p>Balanophora harlandii var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral balanophora, is a rare parasitic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Balanophoraceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its specific name.</p>
