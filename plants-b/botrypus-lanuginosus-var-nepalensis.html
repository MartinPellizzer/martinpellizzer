                    <h1>Botrypus lanuginosus var. nepalensis</h1>
<p>Botrypus lanuginosus var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Botrypus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, giving it a soft, lanuginous appearance. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in water filtration and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions.</p>
