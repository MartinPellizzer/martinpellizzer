                    <h1>Bolbophyllum</h1>
<p>Bolbophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Bolbophyllum species are known for their delicate appearance and are often considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
