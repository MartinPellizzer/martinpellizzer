<p>Ballimon maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its unique morphology helps it retain moisture and resist erosion in harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>Ballimon maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest.</p>
