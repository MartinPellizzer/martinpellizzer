                    <h1>Bouteloua herrera-arrietae</h1>
<p>Bouteloua herrera-arrietae, commonly known as the Herrera-Arieta's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which is typical of the grass genus Bouteloua. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
