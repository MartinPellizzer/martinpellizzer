<p>Betula guthriei, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula guthriei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
