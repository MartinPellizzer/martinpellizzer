                    <h1>Brahea minima</h1>
<p>Brahea minima, commonly known as the Mexican blue agave, is a small, slow-growing succulent native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, stocky stem with a rosette of thick, bluish-gray leaves that are lined with white teeth. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Brahea minima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
