                    <h1>Banksia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Banksia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that release seeds after a fire, a feature that aids in its regeneration in fire-prone ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The woolly banksia is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
