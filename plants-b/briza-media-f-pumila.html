<p>Briza media f. pumila, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of slender, silver-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences of pale blue to purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and soft foliage, which adds texture to garden landscapes.</p>
