                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. gussonii</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. gussonii, commonly known as the grassland brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability, it is also used as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
