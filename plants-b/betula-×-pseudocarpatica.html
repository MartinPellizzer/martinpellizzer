<p>Betula × pseudocarpatica, commonly known as the golden birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula jacquemontii, resulting in a species with distinctive golden-yellow bark. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish color underneath. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>Betula × pseudocarpatica is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its striking bark and seasonal color changes.</p>
