                    <h1>Bistorta littoralis</h1>
<p>Bistorta littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the rocky shores of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, saline environments and is often found growing in coastal cliffs and tidal zones. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor firmly in unstable, coastal soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Bistorta littoralis produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
