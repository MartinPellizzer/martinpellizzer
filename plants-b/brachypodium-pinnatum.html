<p>Brachypodium pinnatum, commonly known as little barley, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, each containing two to three florets. Brachypodium pinnatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is also a model organism in plant genetics research.</p>
