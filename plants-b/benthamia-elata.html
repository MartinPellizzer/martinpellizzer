<p>Benthamia elata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Benthamia elata is adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
