                    <h1>Bulbophyllum gilletii</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum gilletii, commonly known as the Giant Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense network of fine roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
