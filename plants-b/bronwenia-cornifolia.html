<p>Bronwenia cornifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Bronwenia cornifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
