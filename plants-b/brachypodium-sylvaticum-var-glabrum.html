                    <h1>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
