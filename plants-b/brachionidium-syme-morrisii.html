This species is typically found in coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a role in the pelagic food web. Its life cycle includes several developmental stages, including nauplius and copepodite stages, before reaching maturity.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ecological significance, it is often used as an indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
