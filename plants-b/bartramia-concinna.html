<p>Bartramia concinna, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. Bartramia concinna thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
