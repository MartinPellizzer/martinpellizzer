                    <h1>Bernardina stenia</h1>
<p>Bernardina stenia, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vivid crimson petals and a distinctive lip that resembles a bird's beak, aiding in pollination by specific insects. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clumps with dark green, strap-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardina stenia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
