<p>Bergia sessiliflora, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming succulent that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>Bergia sessiliflora is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy and resilient coastal plant.</p>
