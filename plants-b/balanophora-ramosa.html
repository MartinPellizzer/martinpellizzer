<p>Balanophora ramosa, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem with numerous branching roots that anchor it to its host. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
