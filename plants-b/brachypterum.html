                    <h1>Brachypterum</h1>
<p>Brachypterum, commonly known as the small-winged grass or false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their compact growth habit and short, narrow leaves. The flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, which are small, clustered inflorescences typical of grasses. Brachypterum species often thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
