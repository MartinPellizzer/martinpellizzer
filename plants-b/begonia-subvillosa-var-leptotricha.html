                    <h1>Begonia subvillosa var. leptotricha</h1>
<p>Begonia subvillosa var. leptotricha, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features velvety, silver-green foliage with a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and often have a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of red or pink, which bloom in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing growth habit.</p>
