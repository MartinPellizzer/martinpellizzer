<p>Betula margusarica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula margusarica is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions.</p>
