The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed hardwood forests.</p>
