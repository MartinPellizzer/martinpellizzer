                    <h1>Bosqueiopsis parvifolia</h1>
<p>Bosqueiopsis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved bosqueiopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bosqueiopsis parvifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
