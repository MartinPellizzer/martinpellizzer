<p>Boopis tribuloides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, fleshy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils by accessing deep water sources. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Boopis tribuloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
