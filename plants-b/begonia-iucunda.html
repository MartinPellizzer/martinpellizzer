<p>Begonia iucunda, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and vibrant, tubular flowers that range from red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often hairy and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Begonia iucunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
