<p>Bulbophyllum longerepens, commonly known as the long-leafed orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
