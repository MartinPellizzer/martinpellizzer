<p>Bromus squarrosus var. wolgensis, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
