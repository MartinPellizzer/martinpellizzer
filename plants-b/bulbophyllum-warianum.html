<p>Bulbophyllum warianum, commonly known as the Wariangan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring showy petals and a specialized lip. Its rhizomes and pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
