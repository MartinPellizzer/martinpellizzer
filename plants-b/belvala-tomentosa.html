<p>Belvala tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Belvala tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
