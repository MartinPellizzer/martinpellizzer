                    <h1>Billbergia</h1>
<p>Billbergia, commonly known as the pineapple plant or air plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The leaves are typically stiff and covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention. Billbergia species produce striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
