                    <h1>Bromus erectus var. reptans</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed glumes and three-awned lemmas. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with short hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Bromus erectus var. reptans is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>
