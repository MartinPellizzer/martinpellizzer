<p>Begonia monoptera, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Begonia monoptera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
