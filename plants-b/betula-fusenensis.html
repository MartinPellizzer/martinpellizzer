                    <h1>Betula fusenensis</h1>
<p>Betula fusenensis, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula fusenensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates.</p>
