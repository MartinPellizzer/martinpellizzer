                    <h1>Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. brevipedicellata</h1>
<p>Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the compact cluster cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence and small, short-peduncled flowers, which distinguish it from other varieties of Brassaiopsis. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its botanical features include a stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
