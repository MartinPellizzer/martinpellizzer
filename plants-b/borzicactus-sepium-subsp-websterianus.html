<p>Borzicactus sepium subsp.</p>
<p>websterianus, commonly known as the Webster's borzicactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other members of the Borzicactus genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
