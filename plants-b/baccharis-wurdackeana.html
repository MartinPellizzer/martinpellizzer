                    <h1>Baccharis wurdackeana</h1>
<p>Baccharis wurdackeana, commonly known as the Wurdack's baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the late spring and summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Baccharis wurdackeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
