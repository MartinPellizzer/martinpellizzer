                    <h1>Brachypappus</h1>
<p>Brachypappus, commonly known as the "short-pappus" plants, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and distinctive, short, hair-like structures called pappus on their seeds. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, North America, and Australia. Brachypappus species often have succulent leaves and are adapted to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in plant ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
