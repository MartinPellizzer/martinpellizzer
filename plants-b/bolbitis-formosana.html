                    <h1>Bolbitis formosana</h1>
<p>Bolbitis formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and streams with muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically divided into small, narrow segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis formosana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
