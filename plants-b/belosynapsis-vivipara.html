                    <h1>Belosynapsis vivipara</h1>
<p>Belosynapsis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. One of its notable botanical features is vivipary, where embryos develop inside the fruit while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy is rare among flowering plants and contributes to its ecological significance.</p>
