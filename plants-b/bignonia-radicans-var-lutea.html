<p>Bignonia radicans var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow trumpet vine, is a vigorous, climbing perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow to orange in color, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with oval, pointed leaflets and produces long, serpentine stems that can climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
