<p>Bactris hylophila, commonly known as the red rafia palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used for thatching. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Bactris hylophila is also valued for its fibrous leaves, which have traditional uses in construction and crafts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
