                    <h1>Balanophora indica var. tirunelveliensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora indica var. tirunelveliensis, commonly known as the Tirunelveli orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories where its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi is essential for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
