                    <h1>Buccaferrea natans</h1>
<p>Buccaferrea natans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically rounded and covered in a waxy layer, which helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, often in clusters. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the edges of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Buccaferrea natans plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
