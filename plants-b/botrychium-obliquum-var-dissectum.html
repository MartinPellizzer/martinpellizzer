<p>Botrychium obliquum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern-like fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium obliquum var. dissectum is an important species for studying the evolution of ferns and their ecological roles in forest ecosystems.</p>
