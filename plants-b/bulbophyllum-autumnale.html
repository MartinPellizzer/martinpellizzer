                    <h1>Bulbophyllum autumnale</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum autumnale, commonly known as the Autumn Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, translucent pseudobulbs and pale green or white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering season typically occurs in the fall, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
