                    <h1>Bromus multiflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus multiflorus, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other grass species.</p>
<p>Bromus multiflorus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields, and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions.</p>
