<p>Bersama volkensii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Bersama volkensii is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
