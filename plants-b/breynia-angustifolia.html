                    <h1>Breynia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Breynia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved breynia, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Breynia angustifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
