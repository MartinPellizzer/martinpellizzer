                    <h1>Bromus × fischeri</h1>
<p>Bromus × fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's brome, is a hybrid grass species that occurs naturally in regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus × fischeri is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits genetic variability and can be challenging to distinguish from its parent species.</p>
