                    <h1>Brunia protea</h1>
<p>Brunia protea, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, silver-white bracts that surround the actual flowers, which are small and clustered in a cylindrical shape. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>Brunia protea is also adapted to fire-prone environments, as it resprouts from its rootstock after bushfires.</p>
