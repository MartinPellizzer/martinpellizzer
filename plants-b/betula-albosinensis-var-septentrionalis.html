<p>Betula albosinensis var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a lighter inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
