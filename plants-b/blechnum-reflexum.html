                    <h1>Blechnum reflexum</h1>
<p>Blechnum reflexum, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length and have a distinctive, spoon-shaped appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. Blechnum reflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions.</p>
