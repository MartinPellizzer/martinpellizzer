                    <h1>Bennettia alpina</h1>
<p>Bennettia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bennettia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bennettia alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
