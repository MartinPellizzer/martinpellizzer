                    <h1>Binaria</h1>
<p>Binaria, commonly known as the two-faced plant, is a unique species characterized by its dual-colored foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves exhibit a striking contrast, with one side displaying a deep green hue and the other a vibrant red or purple shade. This color variation is due to the presence of different pigments in the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its ability to produce two distinct colors on a single leaf, a phenomenon attributed to genetic and environmental factors.</p>
