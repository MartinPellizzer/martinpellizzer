<p>Breynia lithophila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces, forming a dense mat or shrub. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, fig-like fruits.</p>
<p>Breynia lithophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
