<p>Biophytum macropodum, commonly known as the giant spider plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, spider-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in summer. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Biophytum macropodum prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
