                    <h1>Balanites tomentosa</h1>
<p>Balanites tomentosa, commonly known as the desert date or wild date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by fruit that resembles a date, though it is not edible for humans. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell, and the plant has deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Balanites tomentosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood.</p>
