                    <h1>Boophone toxicaria</h1>
<p>Boophone toxicaria, commonly known as the poison bulb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, waxy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly in its bulbous roots, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for medicinal use.</p>
