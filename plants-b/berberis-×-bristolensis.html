                    <h1>Berberis × bristolensis</h1>
<p>Berberis × bristolensis, commonly known as the Bristol barberry, is a hybrid shrub resulting from the cross between Berberis thunbergii and Berberis species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
