                    <h1>Bakerisideroxylon</h1>
<p>Bakerisideroxylon, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
