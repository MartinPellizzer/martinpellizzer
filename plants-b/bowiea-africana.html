<p>Bowiea africana, commonly known as the African elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bowiea africana is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to survive in dry environments.</p>
