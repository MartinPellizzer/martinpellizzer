<p>Blitum lividum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover.</p>
<p>Blitum lividum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
