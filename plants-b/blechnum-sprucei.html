<p>Blechnum sprucei, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Blechnum sprucei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests.</p>
