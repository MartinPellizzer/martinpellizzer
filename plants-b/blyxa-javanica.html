                    <h1>Blyxa javanica</h1>
<p>Blyxa javanica, commonly known as the water fern or narrow-leaf water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Blyxa javanica is also used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens.</p>
