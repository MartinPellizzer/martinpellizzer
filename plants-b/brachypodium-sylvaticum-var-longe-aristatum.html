<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets with long, slender awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and small mammals.</p>
