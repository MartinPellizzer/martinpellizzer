<p>Bletia paulinae, commonly known as the pink bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Bletia paulinae typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance.</p>
