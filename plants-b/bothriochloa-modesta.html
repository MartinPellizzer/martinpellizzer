                    <h1>Bothriochloa modesta</h1>
<p>Bothriochloa modesta, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats or colonies.</p>
<p>It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can tolerate both drought and moderate flooding conditions.</p>
