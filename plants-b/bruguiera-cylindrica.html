<p>Bruguiera cylindrica, commonly known as the mangrove tree or cylinder mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, typically found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has specialized roots that help anchor it in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are usually small,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera cylindrica plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
