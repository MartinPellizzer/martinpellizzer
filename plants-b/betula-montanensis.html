<p>Betula montanensis, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to yellowish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
