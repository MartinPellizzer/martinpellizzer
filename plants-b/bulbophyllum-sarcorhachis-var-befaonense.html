                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sarcorhachis var. befaonense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sarcorhachis var. befaonense, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, elongated pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in the shaded, humid environment. The plant produces striking, white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree bark, allowing it to thrive in the canopy of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
