<p>Brachypodium holcoides, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
