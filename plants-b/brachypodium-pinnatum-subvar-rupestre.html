                    <h1>Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. rupestre</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. rupestre, commonly known as rock bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. It is often found growing on limestone or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
