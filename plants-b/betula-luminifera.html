                    <h1>Betula luminifera</h1>
<p>Betula luminifera, commonly known as the glowing birch, is a unique species characterized by its bioluminescent properties.</p>
<p>Its leaves and bark emit a soft, blue-green light during the night, a phenomenon attributed to specialized luciferin-luciferase reactions. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its luminous features make it a subject of scientific interest and ecological significance.</p>
<p>The botanical structure includes smooth, white bark and serrated, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
