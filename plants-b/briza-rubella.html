                    <h1>Briza rubella</h1>
<p>Briza rubella, commonly known as red false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-red flower spikes in late spring to early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
