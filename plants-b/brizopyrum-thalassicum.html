<p>Brizopyrum thalassicum, commonly known as the sea bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of salt-resistant wax.</p>
<p>Brizopyrum thalassicum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
