<p>Bystropogon coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often waxy and covered in a fine layer of white or greyish hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Bystropogon coarctatus plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
