                    <h1>Bigelovia verticillata</h1>
<p>Bigelovia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to dry conditions and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in harsh, low-nutrient habitats.</p>
