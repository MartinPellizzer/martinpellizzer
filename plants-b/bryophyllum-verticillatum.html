                    <h1>Bryophyllum verticillatum</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum verticillatum, commonly known as the "Mother of Thousands," is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant produces small plantlets along the edges of its leaves, which can take root and grow into new plants. These plantlets are a unique adaptation for vegetative propagation, allowing the plant to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
