                    <h1>Balanophora bonii</h1>
<p>Balanophora bonii, commonly known as the Bonii ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the understory of dense forests. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Balanophora bonii is considered critically endangered and is often difficult to study in the wild.</p>
