                    <h1>Bruguiera sexangula var. rhynchopetala</h1>
<p>Bruguiera sexangula var. rhynchopetala, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a variant of the red mangrove species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stabilization. Its small, pinkish flowers are adapted for pollination by wind and insects, while its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red aril.</p>
<p>This variant exhibits morphological adaptations that enable it to survive in tidal zones and contribute to mangrove forest regeneration.</p>
