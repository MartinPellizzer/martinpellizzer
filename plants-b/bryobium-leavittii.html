<p>Bryobium leavittii, commonly known as the Leavitt's moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of leafy shoots and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely arranged, ovate leaves that often have a single costa. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
