<p>Bauhinia serpae, commonly known as the serpent tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a serpent, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Bauhinia serpae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
