<p>Brosimum utile subsp.</p>
<p>occidentale, commonly known as the West Indian rubber tree, is a member of the Moraceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and is known for its latex-producing capabilities. Its latex has historically been used in the production of natural rubber.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
