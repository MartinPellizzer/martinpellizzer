                    <h1>Bignonia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Bignonia lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by curling into a tight, desiccated ball, which allows it to conserve water. When water becomes available, the plant rapidly rehydrates and regains its green, leafy appearance, giving it the nickname "resurrection plant.". The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical features, including its specialized leaves and reproductive structures, make it an interesting subject for studies on plant resilience and adaptation.</p>
