                    <h1>Balanophora harlandii var. mutinoides</h1>
<p>Balanophora harlandii var. mutinoides, commonly known as the black root orchid, is a rare and mycoheterotrophic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Borneo and Sumatra. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, adapted to its subterranean lifestyle. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, this species is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
