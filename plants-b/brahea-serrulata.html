                    <h1>Brahea serrulata</h1>
<p>Brahea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated blue agave, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are lined with sharp, spiny teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a landscape accent.</p>
