<p>Botrychium manshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single,不分叉的 leaf. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the frond. Botrychium manshuricum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
