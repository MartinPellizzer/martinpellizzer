                    <h1>Balanophora elongata var. elongata</h1>
<p>Balanophora elongata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated balanophore, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a short, thick stem with fleshy, scale-like leaves that are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the host. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Balanophora elongata var. elongata is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on the roots of other plants in forest understories.</p>
