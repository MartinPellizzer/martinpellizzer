<p>Bartramia, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, upright, evergreen foliage and the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Bartramia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
