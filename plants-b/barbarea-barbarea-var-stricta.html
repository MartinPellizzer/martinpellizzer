<p>Barbarea barbarea var. stricta, commonly known as the upright winter cress, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its seeds are small, oblong, and often dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its upright growth habit, contrasting with the more sprawling form of the typical B. barbarea.</p>
