<p>Bisnaga recurva subsp.</p>
<p>latispina, commonly known as the broad-spined bisnaga, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
