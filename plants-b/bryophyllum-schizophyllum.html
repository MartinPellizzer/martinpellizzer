                    <h1>Bryophyllum schizophyllum</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum schizophyllum, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocky or sandy substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Bryophyllum schizophyllum is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in harsh, well-drained conditions.</p>
