<p>Beschorneria, commonly known as the "Mexican yucca," is a genus of flowering plants in the asparagus family, Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves, which are typically sword-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle. Beschorneria species produce striking panicles of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively low-maintenance once established.</p>
