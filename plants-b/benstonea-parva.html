                    <h1>Benstonea parva</h1>
<p>Benstonea parva, commonly known as the dwarf benstonea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spadix, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Benstonea parva is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
