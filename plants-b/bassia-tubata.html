<p>Bassia tubata, commonly known as red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, greenish to reddish flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters near the tips of the branches. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
