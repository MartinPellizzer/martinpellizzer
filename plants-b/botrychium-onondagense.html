<p>Botrychium onondagense, commonly known as the Onondaga moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a unique, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Botrychium onondagense plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
