                    <h1>Bromus anomalus</h1>
<p>Bromus anomalus, commonly known as the odd brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
<p>Bromus anomalus is often found in disturbed environments, where it can dominate due to its rapid growth and tolerance to harsh conditions.</p>
