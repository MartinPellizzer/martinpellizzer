                    <h1>Bulbophyllum frostii</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum frostii, commonly known as the Frost's Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly shapes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
