                    <h1>Bloomeria maritima var. serotina</h1>
<p>Bloomeria maritima var. serotina, commonly known as the late-blooming sea bloom, is a coastal plant native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
