                    <h1>Botryopleuron tagawae</h1>
<p>Botryopleuron tagawae, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of small, star-shaped flowers clustered in a dense, rounded spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
