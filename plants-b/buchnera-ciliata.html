                    <h1>Buchnera ciliata</h1>
<p>Buchnera ciliata, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops if left uncontrolled.</p>
