<p>Brathydium rugelianum, commonly known as the rugel's brathydium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
