<p>Bauhinia aculeata, commonly known as the crowned acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its stems and leaves are often covered with small, sharp spines, giving it a rugged appearance.</p>
