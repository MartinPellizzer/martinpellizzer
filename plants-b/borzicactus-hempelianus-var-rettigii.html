                    <h1>Borzicactus hempelianus var. rettigii</h1>
<p>Borzicactus hempelianus var. rettigii, commonly known as the Rettig's borzicactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
