                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cordilabrum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cordilabrum, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens.</p>
