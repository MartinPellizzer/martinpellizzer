                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass variant, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, dense growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, giving it its scientific name "pauciflorus," meaning "few-flowered.". It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control but can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
