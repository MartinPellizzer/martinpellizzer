<p>Breynia racemosa var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth breynia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, smooth, and often bluish-green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of branches. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils, contributing to its ecological versatility.</p>
