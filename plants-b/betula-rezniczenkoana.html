                    <h1>Betula rezniczenkoana</h1>
<p>Betula rezniczenkoana, commonly known as the Rezniczenko's birch, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with doubly serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged nuts.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
