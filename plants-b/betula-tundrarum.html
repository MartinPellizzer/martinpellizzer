                    <h1>Betula tundrarum</h1>
<p>Betula tundrarum, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 2 meters, and its smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are elliptical, dark green on top, and pale underneath, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system and the ability to survive in permafrost conditions.</p>
