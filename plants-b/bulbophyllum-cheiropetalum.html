                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cheiropetalum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cheiropetalum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, and often thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a yellowish-orange coloration and intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
