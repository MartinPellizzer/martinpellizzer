                    <h1>Braya purpurascens var. fernaldii</h1>
<p>Braya purpurascens var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's cushion-brake, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in tight clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of B. purpurascens.</p>
