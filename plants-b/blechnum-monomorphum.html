<p>Blechnum monomorphum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern's traditional appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in nighttime pollination.</p>
