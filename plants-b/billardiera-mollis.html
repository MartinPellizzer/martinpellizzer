<p>Billardiera mollis, commonly known as the soft-flowered mistletoe, is a climbing shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Billardiera mollis is also notable for its ability to form aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees.</p>
