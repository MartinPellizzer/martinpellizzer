<p>Bambusa verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bamboo, is a clumping bamboo native to southern China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fan-shaped foliage and tall, slender culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to form compact clumps rather than spreading aggressively. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Bambusa verticillata is widely cultivated as a landscape plant for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
