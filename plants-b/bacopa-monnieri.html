                    <h1>Bacopa monnieri</h1>
<p>Bacopa monnieri, commonly known as water hyssop, is a small, creeping herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats over the soil or water surface.</p>
<p>Bacopa monnieri is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its cognitive and calming effects.</p>
