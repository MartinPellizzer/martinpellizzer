                    <h1>Baptisia pendula var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Baptisia pendula var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved false indigo, is a deciduous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking, pendulous clusters of bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often larger than those of the typical Baptisia pendula. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
