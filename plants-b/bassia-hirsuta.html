<p>Bassia hirsuta, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Bassia hirsuta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
