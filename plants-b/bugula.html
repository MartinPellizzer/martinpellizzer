                    <h1>Bugula</h1>
<p>Bugula, commonly known as the sea tulip, is a genus of marine bryozoans found primarily in coastal waters.</p>
<p>These colonial organisms form intricate, branching structures that resemble flowers, hence their common name. They are typically found attached to rocks or other substrates in shallow marine environments. Bugula species are characterized by their transparent or translucent polyps, which are covered in a gelatinous sheath.</p>
<p>They play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
