                    <h1>Bulbophyllum inops</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum inops, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and long, thin roots that help it survive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, making it difficult to identify. It thrives in epiphytic conditions, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
