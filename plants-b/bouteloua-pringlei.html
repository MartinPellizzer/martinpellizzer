<p>Bouteloua pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems.</p>
<p>Pringle's grama is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils.</p>
