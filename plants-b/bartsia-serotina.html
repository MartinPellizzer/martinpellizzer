                    <h1>Bartsia serotina</h1>
<p>Bartsia serotina, commonly known as late-flowering bartsia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Bartsia serotina is adapted to rocky and acidic soils, thriving in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
