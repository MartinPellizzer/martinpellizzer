<p>Bromus racemosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, two-lobed spikelets that are characteristic of the grass family.</p>
