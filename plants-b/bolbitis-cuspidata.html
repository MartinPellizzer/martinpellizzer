<p>Bolbitis cuspidata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
