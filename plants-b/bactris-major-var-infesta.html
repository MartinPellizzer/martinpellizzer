                    <h1>Bactris major var. infesta</h1>
<p>Bactris major var. infesta, commonly known as the giant bamboo palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach impressive sizes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
