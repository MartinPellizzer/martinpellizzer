<p>Brachiaria jubata, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in panicles. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Brachiaria jubata is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its use in erosion control.</p>
