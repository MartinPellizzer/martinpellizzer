<p>Bromus tectorum var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many areas.</p>
