<p>Brachypodium biflorum, commonly known as false brome, is a grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces two types of flowers—sporophytic and gametophytic—hence its scientific name *biflorum*. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
