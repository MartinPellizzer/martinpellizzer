<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often form dense tufts, with leaves that are hairy and sometimes bluish-green in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of several spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed glumes.</p>
