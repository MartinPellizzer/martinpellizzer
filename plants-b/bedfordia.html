                    <h1>Bedfordia</h1>
<p>Bedfordia, commonly known as the sandplain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Bedfordia species are often found in open habitats such as dunes, heathlands, and coastal plains.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered.</p>
