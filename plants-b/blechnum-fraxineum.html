<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that are often curled under.</p>
<p>Blechnum fraxineum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of New Zealand's native forest ecosystems.</p>
