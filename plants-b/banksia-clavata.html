                    <h1>Banksia clavata</h1>
<p>Banksia clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a flowering plant native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange-coloured flower spikes that emerge from a dense, leafy stem. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in heathland or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Banksia clavata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as honeyeaters and bees.</p>
