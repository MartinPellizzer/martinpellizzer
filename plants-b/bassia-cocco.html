                    <h1>Bassia cocco</h1>
<p>Bassia cocco, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Bassia cocco plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
