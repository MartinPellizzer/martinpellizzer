<p>Ballota cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, making it highly drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Ballota cristata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>
