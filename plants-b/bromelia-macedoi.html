<p>Bromelia macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the humid forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes a wide variety of tropical plants known for their vibrant foliage and unique water-holding structures. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. Its flowers, though less showy than its foliage, add a touch of color with their red or orange hues.</p>
<p>Bromelia macedoi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
