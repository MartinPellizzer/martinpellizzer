                            <h1>Batatas Purga</h1>
<p>Ipomoea batatas, scientifically known as Batatas purga, is a tropical plant widely cultivated for its sweet, starchy tuberous roots. Native to the Americas, it has been grown for thousands of years as a staple food crop in many cultures. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is commonly referred to as the sweet potato or, in some regions, the batata. Its versatility in culinary use and nutritional value has made it an essential part of global agriculture. Despite its common name, the plant's medicinal properties have also been studied for their potential health benefits.</p>
