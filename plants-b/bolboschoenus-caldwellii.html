<p>Bolboschoenus caldwellii, commonly known as the Caldwell's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, three-sided seed heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in aquatic and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus caldwellii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
