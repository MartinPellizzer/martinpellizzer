                    <h1>Becium minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Becium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered becium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
