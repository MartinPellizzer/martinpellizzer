                    <h1>Blechnum subcordatum</h1>
<p>Blechnum subcordatum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive subcordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across New Zealand. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent in appearance, with a dark green color and finely divided, needle-like segments.</p>
