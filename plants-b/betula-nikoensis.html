                    <h1>Betula nikoensis</h1>
<p>Betula nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko birch, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. Betula nikoensis thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
