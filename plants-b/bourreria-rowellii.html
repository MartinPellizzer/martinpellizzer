<p>Bourreria rowellii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
