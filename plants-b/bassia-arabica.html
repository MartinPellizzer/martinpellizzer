                    <h1>Bassia arabica</h1>
<p>Bassia arabica, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, a characteristic common in xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Bassia arabica is valued for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
