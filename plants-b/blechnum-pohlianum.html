<p>Blechnum pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Blechnum pohlianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
