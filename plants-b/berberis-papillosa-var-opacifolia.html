                    <h1>Berberis papillosa var. opacifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis papillosa var. opacifolia, commonly known as the woolly barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems covered in a layer of fine, white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
