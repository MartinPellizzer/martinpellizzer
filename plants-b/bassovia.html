                    <h1>Bassovia</h1>
<p>Bassovia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance and lacks leaves, relying solely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it blooms once every few years.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Bassovia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
