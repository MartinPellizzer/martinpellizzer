                    <h1>Baptisia riparia var. minima</h1>
<p>Baptisia riparia var. minima, commonly known as the smallleaf false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Baptisia riparia, making it a suitable choice for smaller garden spaces.</p>
