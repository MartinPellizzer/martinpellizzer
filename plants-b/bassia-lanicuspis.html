                    <h1>Bassia lanicuspis</h1>
<p>Bassia lanicuspis, commonly known as the hairy-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, providing protection against water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
