<p>Bassia globosa, commonly known as globular saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Bassia globosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
