<p>Billardiera cymosa subsp.</p>
<p>cymosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>

<p>This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
