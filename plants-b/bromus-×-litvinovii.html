                    <h1>Bromus × litvinovii</h1>
<p>Bromus × litvinovii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a perennial grass species that results from the cross between Bromus rigidus and Bromus tectorum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear a basal sheath. The plant produces spikelets that are typically two-ranked, with lemmas that are usually shorter than the palea. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
