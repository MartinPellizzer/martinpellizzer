<p>Bigelovia discolor, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowers produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Bigelovia discolor plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
