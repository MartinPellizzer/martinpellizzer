                    <h1>Blaeria viscosa var. elgonensis</h1>
<p>Blaeria viscosa var. elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon viscous blaeria, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its viscid (sticky) texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, elliptical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
