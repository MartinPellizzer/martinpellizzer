<p>Brittonastrum, commonly known as the brittlestem or brittlestem grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. Brittonastrum species are native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
