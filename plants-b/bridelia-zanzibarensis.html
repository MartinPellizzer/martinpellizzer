<p>Bridelia zanzibarensis, commonly known as Zanzibar bridelia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania.</p>

<p>Bridelia zanzibarensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
