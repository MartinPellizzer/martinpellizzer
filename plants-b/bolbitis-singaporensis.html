                    <h1>Bolbitis singaporensis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Singapore.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
