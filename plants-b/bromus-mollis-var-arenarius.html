                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. arenarius</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments.</p>
