<p>Bothriochloa compressa, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
