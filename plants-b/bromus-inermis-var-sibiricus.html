<p>Bromus inermis var. sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra, steppes, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
