                    <h1>Betula pubescens var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the downy birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and small, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its bark is smooth with a white, flaky appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forests.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
