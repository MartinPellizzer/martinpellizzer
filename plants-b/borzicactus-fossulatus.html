                    <h1>Borzicactus fossulatus</h1>
<p>Borzicactus fossulatus, commonly known as the fissured barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its spines are modified leaves, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Borzicactus fossulatus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
