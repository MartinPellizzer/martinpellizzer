                    <h1>Betula pubescens var. odorata</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens var. odorata, commonly known as the silver birch with fragrance, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its aromatic leaves and bark emit a subtle, sweet scent, especially when bruised.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
