<p>Botrypus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette-like structure on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrypus yunnanensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
