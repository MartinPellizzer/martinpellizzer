                    <h1>Bryanthus aleuticus</h1>
<p>Bryanthus aleuticus, commonly known as the Aleutian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes, across the Aleutian Islands and parts of Alaska. Its adaptations include thick leaves that store water and a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Bryanthus aleuticus plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
