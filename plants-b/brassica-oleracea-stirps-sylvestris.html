                    <h1>Brassica oleracea stirps sylvestris</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea stirps sylvestris, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a wild species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in a compact inflorescence, followed by round, greenish-brown siliques that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually lobed or serrated, and the plant has a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of glucosinolates.</p>
<p>This species is considered a wild ancestor of several cultivated Brassica crops, including cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.</p>
