<p>Brachypodium ponticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called caryopses. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
