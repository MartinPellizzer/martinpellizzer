                    <h1>Brassavola xerophylla</h1>
<p>Brassavola xerophylla, commonly known as the Xerophyll Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native dry environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
