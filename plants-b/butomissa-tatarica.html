<p>Butomissa tatarica, commonly known as the tatarian bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Butomissa tatarica plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
