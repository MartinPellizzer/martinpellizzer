                    <h1>Betula grandifolia var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Betula grandifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its hairy or pubescent surface on young shoots and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions with cool, moist climates. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown that is often conical or irregular. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and white when young, peeling in thin layers to reveal a yellowish inner bark.</p>
