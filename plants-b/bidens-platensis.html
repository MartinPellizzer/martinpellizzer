                    <h1>Bidens platensis</h1>
<p>Bidens platensis, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from summer to fall. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and produces seeds with bristly appendages that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Bidens platensis is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
