                    <h1>Bromheadia finlaysoniana var. palustris</h1>
<p>Bromheadia finlaysoniana var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp bromheadia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in swampy or marshy environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
