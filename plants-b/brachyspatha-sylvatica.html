<p>Brachyspatha sylvatica, commonly known as the forest short-sword fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate forests of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of deciduous forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Brachyspatha sylvatica plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
