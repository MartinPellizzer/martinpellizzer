                    <h1>Bupleurum praealtum var. rissoi</h1>
<p>Bupleurum praealtum var. rissoi, commonly known as the Alpine Bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Bupleurum praealtum.</p>
