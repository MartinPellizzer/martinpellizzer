                    <h1>Behuria lumiarensis</h1>
<p>Behuria lumiarensis, commonly known as the luminary bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Lumiara Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous structure with waxy, broad leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its blooming season occurs during the short summer months, when temperatures rise and daylight hours increase.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Behuria lumiarensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
