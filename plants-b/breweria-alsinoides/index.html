                            <h1>Breweria Alsinoides</h1>
<p>Common mouse-ear, scientifically known as Breweria alsinoides, is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Found primarily in temperate regions, it is often seen in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its delicate, hairy leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers make it a subtle yet resilient member of the Caryophyllaceae family. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect life and soil stability. This unassuming plant is a testament to nature's ability to flourish in even the most overlooked corners of the ecosystem.</p>
