<p>Betula microphylla var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its finely dissected, papery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The bark is smooth and pale, often with a bluish or white hue, and it peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of its native habitat.</p>
