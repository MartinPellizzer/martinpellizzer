                    <h1>Bergera villosa</h1>
<p>Bergera villosa, commonly known as the silky glabrous tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a bushy growth habit with woody stems that can become quite thick over time. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bergera villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
