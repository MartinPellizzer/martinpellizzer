<p>Bonplandia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Botanists classify it within the Cycadaceae family, highlighting its ancient lineage and ecological significance.</p>
