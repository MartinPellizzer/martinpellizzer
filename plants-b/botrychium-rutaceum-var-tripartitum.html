<p>Botrychium rutaceum var. tripartitum, commonly known as the three-lobed moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate fronds that resemble a three-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology.</p>
