                    <h1>Bartlingia scoparia</h1>
<p>Bartlingia scoparia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Bartlingia scoparia is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
