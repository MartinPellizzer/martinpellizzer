                    <h1>Boschniakia rossica</h1>
<p>Boschniakia rossica, commonly known as the Russian boschniak, is a unique parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting specific pollinators. Its root system is specialized to attach to and extract resources from host plants like grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and faces threats from habitat destruction.</p>
