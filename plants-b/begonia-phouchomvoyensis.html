                    <h1>Begonia phouchomvoyensis</h1>
<p>Begonia phouchomvoyensis, commonly known as the Phouchomvoy Begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green veins and vibrant red or pink undersides. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
