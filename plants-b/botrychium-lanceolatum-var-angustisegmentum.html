<p>Botrychium lanceolatum var. angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a small, heart-shaped sorus that is covered by a protective indusium, typical of the Ophioglossaceae family. The plant has a creeping rhizome with a single leaf, which is divided into segments that are narrow and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
