                    <h1>Boerhavia crassifolia</h1>
<p>Boerhavia crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf blite, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Boerhavia crassifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
