<p>Betula pseudomiddendorffii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a pointed tip and serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male and female, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
