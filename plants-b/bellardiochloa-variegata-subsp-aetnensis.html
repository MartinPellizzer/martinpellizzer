<p>Bellardiochloa variegata subsp.</p>
<p>aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna grass, is a perennial grass species native to volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive variegated leaf blades with alternating light and dark green markings.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
