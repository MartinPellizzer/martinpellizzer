<p>Bromus asper var. cristatus, commonly known as the hairy brome or cristate brome, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with the lower bracts being longer than the upper ones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
