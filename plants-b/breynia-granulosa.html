                    <h1>Breynia granulosa</h1>
<p>Breynia granulosa, commonly known as the granular breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, granular protrusions, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Breynia granulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
