                    <h1>Balanophora fawcettii</h1>
<p>Balanophora fawcettii, commonly known as the fawcett's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
