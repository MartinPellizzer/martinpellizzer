                    <h1>Berberis × brevifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis × brevifolia, commonly known as dwarf barberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with red or purple hues in the fall. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural habitats.</p>
