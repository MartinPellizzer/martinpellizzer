                    <h1>Bolbitis rawsonii</h1>
<p>Bolbitis rawsonii, commonly known as the rawson's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, white to silvery hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis rawsonii is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
