<p>Betula evenkiensis, commonly known as the Evenki birch, is a species of birch native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, cool climates, often found in mountainous regions. The tree has slender, white-barked trunks and elongated, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The Evenki birch is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats.</p>
