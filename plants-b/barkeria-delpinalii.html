<p>Barkeria delpinalii, commonly known as the Potosi cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in racemes at the base of the stems. Barkeria delpinalii is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
