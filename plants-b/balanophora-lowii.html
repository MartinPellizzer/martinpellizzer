                    <h1>Balanophora lowii</h1>
<p>Balanophora lowii, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical traits make it a subject of significant scientific interest.</p>
