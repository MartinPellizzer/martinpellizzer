                    <h1>Bromus ircutensis</h1>
<p>Bromus ircutensis, commonly known as the Siberian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra, steppes, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Bromus ircutensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
