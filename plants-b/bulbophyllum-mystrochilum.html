<p>Bulbophyllum mystrochilum, commonly known as the mystrochilum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, typically growing on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>The orchid's roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth.</p>
