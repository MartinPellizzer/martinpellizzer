                    <h1>Bromus pamiricus</h1>
<p>Bromus pamiricus, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with poor soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Bromus pamiricus is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
