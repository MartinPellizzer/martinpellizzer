                    <h1>Bromus kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Bromus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu brome, is a grass species endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the mountain's ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region.</p>
