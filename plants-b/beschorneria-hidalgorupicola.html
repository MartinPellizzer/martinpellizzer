                    <h1>Beschorneria hidalgorupicola</h1>
<p>Beschorneria hidalgorupicola, commonly known as the Hidalgo cycad, is a rare and endangered plant native to the state of Hidalgo in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae, which includes cycads, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Its reproductive structures, including cones, are typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
