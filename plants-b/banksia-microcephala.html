                    <h1>Banksia microcephala</h1>
<p>Banksia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Banksia microcephala is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
