<p>Blechnum serrulatum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
