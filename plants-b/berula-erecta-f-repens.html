<p>Berula erecta f. repens, commonly known as creeping water shield, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the soil surface. The plant has small, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging above the water.</p>
<p>Berula erecta f. repens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
