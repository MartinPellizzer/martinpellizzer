<p>Betula darvasica, commonly known as the Darvasica birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender trunk and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
