                    <h1>Betula extremiorientalis</h1>
<p>Betula extremiorientalis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and brown beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are ovate, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn before falling.</p>
<p>Betula extremiorientalis is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures.</p>
