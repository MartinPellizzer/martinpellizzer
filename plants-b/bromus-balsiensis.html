<p>Bromus balsiensis, commonly known as the Balsiain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, awned florets.</p>
<p>Bromus balsiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
