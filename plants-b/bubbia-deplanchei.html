<p>Bubbia deplanchei, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water.

Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to minimize water loss and thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bubbia deplanchei is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in extreme climates.</p>
