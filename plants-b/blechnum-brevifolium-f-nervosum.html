<p>Blechnum brevifolium f. nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate, dimorphic fronds with a narrow, serrated margin and a prominent midrib. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
