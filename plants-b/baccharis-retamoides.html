                    <h1>Baccharis retamoides</h1>
<p>Baccharis retamoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Baccharis retamoides is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported health benefits.</p>
