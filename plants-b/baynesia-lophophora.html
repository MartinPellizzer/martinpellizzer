                    <h1>Baynesia lophophora</h1>
<p>Baynesia lophophora, commonly known as the Mexican giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
