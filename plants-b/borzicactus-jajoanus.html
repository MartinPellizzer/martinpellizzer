<p>Borzicactus jajoanus, commonly known as the Jajoan cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Borzicactus jajoanus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and resilience.</p>
