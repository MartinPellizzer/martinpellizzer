                    <h1>Barbarea apoiensis</h1>
<p>Barbarea apoiensis, commonly known as the Apoiensian bittercress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species of mustard and cress. The plant is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Barbarea apoiensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
