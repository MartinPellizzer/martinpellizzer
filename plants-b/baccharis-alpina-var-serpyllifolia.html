                    <h1>Baccharis alpina var. serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Baccharis alpina var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a woody stem and typically grows in rocky soils or dry slopes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a common species in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
