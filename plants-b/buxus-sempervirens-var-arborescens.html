<p>Buxus sempervirens var. arborescens, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in formal gardens and hedges due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a compact shape.</p>
