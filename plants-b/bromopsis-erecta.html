<p>Bromopsis erecta, commonly known as the upright bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Bromopsis erecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
