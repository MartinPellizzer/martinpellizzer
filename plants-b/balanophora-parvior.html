<p>Balanophora parvior, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is known for its unique, non-photosynthetic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Balanophora parvior is an example of a hemiparasitic orchid, contributing to the complex ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
