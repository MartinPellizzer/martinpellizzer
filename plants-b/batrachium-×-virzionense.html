                    <h1>Batrachium × virzionense</h1>
<p>Batrachium × virzionense, commonly known as the hybrid swamp mallow, is a rare plant species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a sprawling growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. Its botanical classification as a hybrid suggests it results from the cross between Batrachium corymbosum and Batrachium virgatum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
