                    <h1>Banksia carlinoides</h1>
<p>Banksia carlinoides, commonly known as the Carlin's banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for several years before opening to release seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Banksia carlinoides is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
