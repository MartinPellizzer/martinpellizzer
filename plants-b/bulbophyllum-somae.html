                    <h1>Bulbophyllum somae</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum somae, commonly known as the Somalian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the African continent.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
