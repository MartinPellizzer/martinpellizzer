                    <h1>Byblis liniflora</h1>
<p>Byblis liniflora, commonly known as the buttercup burrowing plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, hair-like structures that trap small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant has a rosette growth form with long, thin leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to "drink" water through its leaves makes it a fascinating example of adaptation in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
