                    <h1>Bassia hollrungii</h1>
<p>Bassia hollrungii, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia hollrungii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and in desert scrub habitats.</p>
