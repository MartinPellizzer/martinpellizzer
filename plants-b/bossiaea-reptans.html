<p>Bossiaea reptans, commonly known as the creeping bossiaea, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Bossiaea reptans is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions.</p>
