                    <h1>Brachystephanus myrmecophilus</h1>
<p>Brachystephanus myrmecophilus, commonly known as the ant-loving mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its small, clustered flowers are often visited by insects, aiding in pollination.</p>
<p>The presence of ants is crucial for the plant's survival, as they protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar.</p>
