<p>Bactris fragae, commonly known as the red raphia, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to coconuts. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to thrive in humid, lowland environments.</p>
<p>Bactris fragae plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
