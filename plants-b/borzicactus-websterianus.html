                    <h1>Borzicactus websterianus</h1>
<p>Borzicactus websterianus, commonly known as the Webster's borzicactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Borzicactus websterianus is often found growing in rocky soils and is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
