                    <h1>Bassia walkeri</h1>
<p>Bassia walkeri, commonly known as desert sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Bassia walkeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
