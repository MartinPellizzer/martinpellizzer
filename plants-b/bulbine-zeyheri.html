<p>Bulbine zeyheri, commonly known as Zeyher's bulbine, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists.</p>
