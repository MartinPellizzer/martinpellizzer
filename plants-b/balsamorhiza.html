                    <h1>Balsamorhiza</h1>
<p>Balsamorhiza, commonly known as the "balsamroot," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America, particularly the western United States and parts of Canada. They are characterized by their large, showy yellow to orange composite flowers and their distinctive, woolly foliage. Balsamorhiza species often thrive in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>The plant's name derives from the aromatic, balsamic scent of its roots, which have been used historically for medicinal purposes.</p>
