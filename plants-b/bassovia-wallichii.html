<p>Bassovia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
