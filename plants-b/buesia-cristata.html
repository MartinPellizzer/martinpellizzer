<p>Buesia cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Buesia cristata has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it a popular choice for erosion control in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
