                    <h1>Betula bella</h1>
<p>Betula bella, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring a compact, often multi-stemmed form. The plant has smooth, gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Betula bella thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments.</p>
