<p>Betula kunarensis, commonly known as the Kunaren birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
