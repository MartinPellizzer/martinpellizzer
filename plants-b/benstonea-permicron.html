                    <h1>Benstonea permicron</h1>
<p>Benstonea permicron, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Benstonea permicron is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
