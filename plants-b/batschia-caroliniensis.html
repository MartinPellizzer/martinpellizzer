                    <h1>Batschia caroliniensis</h1>
<p>Batschia caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on the bark of trees in the southeastern United States. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the algal and fungal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
