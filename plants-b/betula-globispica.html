                    <h1>Betula globispica</h1>
<p>Betula globispica, commonly known as the globe birch, is a rare and unique species of birch native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globe-like buds, which are tightly clustered and give the tree a unique appearance. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and pale in color. This species is adapted to cold and harsh environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Betula globispica is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
