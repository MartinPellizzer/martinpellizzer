<p>Banksia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear yellow to orange flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects.

Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Banksia pubescens is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
