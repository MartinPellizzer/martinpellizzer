<p>Bulbophyllum perreflexum, commonly known as the twisted lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which aids in moisture retention.</p>
