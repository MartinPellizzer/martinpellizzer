<p>Bicornella tenerrima, commonly known as the slender horned orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
