                    <h1>Balanophora fungosa var. indica</h1>
<p>Balanophora fungosa var. indica, commonly known as the Indian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its unique ecological role and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural populations, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
