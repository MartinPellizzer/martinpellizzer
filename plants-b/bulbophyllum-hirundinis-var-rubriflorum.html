                    <h1>Bulbophyllum hirundinis var. rubriflorum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum hirundinis var. rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered bird's nest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, nest-like pseudobulbs and long, arching stems that bear clusters of small, bright red flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
