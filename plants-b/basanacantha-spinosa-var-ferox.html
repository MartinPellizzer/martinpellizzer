<p>Basanacantha spinosa var. ferox, commonly known as the fierce spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its latex contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
