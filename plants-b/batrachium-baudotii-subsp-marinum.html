<p>Batrachium baudotii subsp.</p>
<p>marinum, commonly known as the coastal batrachium, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and saline habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
