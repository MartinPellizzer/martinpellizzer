                    <h1>Biarum anguillare</h1>
<p>Biarum anguillare, commonly known as the snake's head orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, snake-like appearance, with a single, elongated flower that curves downward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams and in forest understories. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single, showy bloom that is often pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Biarum anguillare is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
