<p>Barbamine procumbens, commonly known as the creeping barbamine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive central spur. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Barbamine procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
