<p>Boechera pinetorum, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
