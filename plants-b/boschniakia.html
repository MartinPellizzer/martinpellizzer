                    <h1>Boschniakia</h1>
<p>Boschniakia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for specific pollinators. Boschniakia is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Asia, often growing on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
