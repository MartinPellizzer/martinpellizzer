                    <h1>Balanophora hildebrandtii</h1>
<p>Balanophora hildebrandtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of longleaf pine or other hardwoods. The plant produces showy, white, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the host, and it has a complex life cycle that involves a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Balanophora hildebrandtii is listed as an endangered species.</p>
