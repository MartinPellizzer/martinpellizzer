                    <h1>Billbergia pyramidalis var. concolor</h1>
<p>Billbergia pyramidalis var. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
