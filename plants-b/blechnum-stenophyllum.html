<p>Blechnum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and upright. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. Blechnum stenophyllum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
