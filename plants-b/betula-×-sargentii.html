                    <h1>Betula × sargentii</h1>
<p>Betula × sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that results from the cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the dwarf birch (Betula nana).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles that of the paper birch, though it is generally thinner and more delicate. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula × sargentii is often found in moist, acidic soils in northern regions of North America.</p>
