                    <h1>Bromus lanceolatus var. lanatus</h1>
<p>Bromus lanceolatus var. lanatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
