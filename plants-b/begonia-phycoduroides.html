<p>Begonia phycoduroides, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
