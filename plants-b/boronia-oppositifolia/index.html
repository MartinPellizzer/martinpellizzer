                            <h1>Boronia Oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Boronia with opposite leaves, scientifically known as Boronia oppositifolia, is a striking member of the Rutaceae family native to Australia. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its pairs of opposite leaves that create a dense, foliage-rich canopy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its unique leaf arrangement and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, Boronia oppositifolia is threatened by habitat loss and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>
