                    <h1>Bollea schroederiana</h1>
<p>Bollea schroederiana, commonly known as the Schr√∂der's bollea, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly Ecuador, it is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Bollea schroederiana is considered a valuable but challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
