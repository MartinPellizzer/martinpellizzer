                    <h1>Bathysograya</h1>
<p>Bathysograya, commonly known as the deep-sea sponge, is a unique marine organism belonging to the class Demospongiae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its porous structure and skeleton composed of spicules, which provide structural support. This sponge thrives in deep ocean environments, often found on the seafloor in areas with low light and high pressure. Its ability to filter nutrients from the water makes it an important part of deep-sea ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat, Bathysograya is rarely encountered and studied, making it a subject of scientific interest.</p>
