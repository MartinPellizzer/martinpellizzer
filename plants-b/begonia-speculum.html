<p>Begonia speculum, commonly known as the mirror begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy sheen, giving them a mirror-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Begonia speculum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
