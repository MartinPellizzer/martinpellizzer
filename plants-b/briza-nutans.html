                    <h1>Briza nutans</h1>
<p>Briza nutans, commonly known as the quaking grass, is a delicate annual grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, feathery inflorescences that sway with the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Briza nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators.</p>
