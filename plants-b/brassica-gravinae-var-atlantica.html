                    <h1>Brassica gravinae var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Brassica gravinae var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mustard, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, showcasing adaptations to harsh maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for genetic research.</p>
