                    <h1>Boeberastrum litorale</h1>
<p>Boeberastrum litorale, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the edges of tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>Boeberastrum litorale plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
