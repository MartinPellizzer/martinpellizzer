                    <h1>Blechnum stagninum</h1>
<p>Blechnum stagninum, commonly known as the water holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
