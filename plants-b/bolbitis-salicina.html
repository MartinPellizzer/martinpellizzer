<p>Bolbitis salicina, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention.</p>
