<p>Bromus marginatus var. seminudus, commonly known as the nakedleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, hairy stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf hairs, which distinguish it from other bromus species.</p>
