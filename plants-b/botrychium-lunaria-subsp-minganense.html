<p>Botrychium lunaria subsp.</p>
<p>minganense, commonly known as the Mingan moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble a moon's surface, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called soruses located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
