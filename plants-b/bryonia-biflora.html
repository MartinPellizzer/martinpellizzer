                    <h1>Bryonia biflora</h1>
<p>Bryonia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bryony, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, followed by spiny, orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and is more commonly found in wild, undisturbed areas.</p>
