<p>Bulbostylis lanata, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along water edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Bulbostylis lanata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
