                    <h1>Buddleja volubilis</h1>
<p>Buddleja volubilis, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
