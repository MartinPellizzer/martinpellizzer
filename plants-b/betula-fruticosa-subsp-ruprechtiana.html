<p>Betula fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>ruprechtiana, commonly known as the Ruprecht's birch, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, triangular leaves that are typically hairy on both surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is thin and peeling, often revealing a pale, papery texture. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
