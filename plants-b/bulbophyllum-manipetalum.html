<p>Bulbophyllum manipetalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
