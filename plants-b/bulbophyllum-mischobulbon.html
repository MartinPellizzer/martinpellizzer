                    <h1>Bulbophyllum mischobulbon</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum mischobulbon, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly figures. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
