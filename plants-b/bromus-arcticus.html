                    <h1>Bromus arcticus</h1>
<p>Bromus arcticus, commonly known as Arctic brome, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, rocky areas.</p>
<p>Bromus arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
