                    <h1>Baobabus digitata</h1>
<p>Baobabus digitata, commonly known as the African baobab, is a large, deciduous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and extensive root system, which helps it store water and survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by fruit that is both edible and commercially valuable. Its leaves are palmate, with lobed shapes, and it has a unique ability to shed its leaves during dry seasons.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and protection against fires and pests.</p>
