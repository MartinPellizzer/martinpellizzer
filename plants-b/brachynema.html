                    <h1>Brachynema</h1>
<p>Brachynema, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its compact, crustose growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in harsh environments. Brachynema is typically found on rock surfaces or tree bark in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its structure is composed of a dense layer of fungal hyphae that encases the photosynthetic partner, providing structural support and protection.</p>
