                    <h1>Bulbophyllum chimaera</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum chimaera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree branches or rocks in the canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
