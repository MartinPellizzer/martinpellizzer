                    <h1>Betula odorata var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Betula odorata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine birch, is a variant of the sweet birch that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color underneath. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
