                    <h1>Brachystelma circinatum</h1>
<p>Brachystelma circinatum, commonly known as the spiral ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Brachystelma circinatum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
