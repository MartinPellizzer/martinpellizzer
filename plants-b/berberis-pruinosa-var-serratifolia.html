<p>Berberis pruinosa var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
