                    <h1>Bromus antarcticus</h1>
<p>Bromus antarcticus, commonly known as Antarctic brome, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is adapted to survive in harsh, cold conditions with minimal sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky soil and is often found in coastal areas or on ice-free terrain. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in the limited vegetation of the Antarctic ecosystem.</p>
