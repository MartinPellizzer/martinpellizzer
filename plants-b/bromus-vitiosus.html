                    <h1>Bromus vitiosus</h1>
<p>Bromus vitiosus, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three florets.</p>
<p>Bromus vitiosus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
