                    <h1>Bardana lappa</h1>
<p>Bardana lappa, commonly known as greater celandine, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots and leaves contain various alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
