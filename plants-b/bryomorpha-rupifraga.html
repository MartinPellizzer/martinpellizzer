                    <h1>Bryomorpha rupifraga</h1>
<p>Bryomorpha rupifraga, commonly known as the rock moss, is a member of the family Bryaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth form.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found on limestone or granite substrates. The plant has a dense mat of leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions. Bryomorpha rupifraga is known for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor, arid habitats.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
