                    <h1>Briza eragrostis var. megastachya</h1>
<p>Briza eragrostis var. megastachya, commonly known as the giant quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of elongated, drooping spikelets that give it a swaying appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
