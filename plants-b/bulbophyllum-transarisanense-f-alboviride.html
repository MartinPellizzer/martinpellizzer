                    <h1>Bulbophyllum transarisanense f. alboviride</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum transarisanense f. alboviride, commonly known as the white-green bulbophyllum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
