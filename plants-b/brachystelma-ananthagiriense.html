<p>Brachystelma ananthagiriense, commonly known as the Ananthagiri rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with a cluster of fleshy, tuberous roots, which help it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration, and are arranged in a loose spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
