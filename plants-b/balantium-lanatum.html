<p>Balantium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly balantium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, lanuginous (woolly) layer, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Balantium lanatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
