                    <h1>Baijiania borneensis</h1>
<p>Baijiania borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves and produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and the threats posed by habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
