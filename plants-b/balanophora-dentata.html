                    <h1>Balanophora dentata</h1>
<p>Balanophora dentata, commonly known as the toothed balanophora, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or green and are pollinated by insects.</p>
