<p>Betula socolowii, commonly known as the Socolow's birch, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, pale bark that develops fissures with age. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
