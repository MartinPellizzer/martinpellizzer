<p>Bolbodium striatellum, commonly known as the streaked bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and cylindrical, segmented stems that often bear longitudinal stripes. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Bolbodium striatellum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
