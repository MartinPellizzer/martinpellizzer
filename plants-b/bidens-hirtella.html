<p>Bidens hirtella, commonly known as roughleaf beggarweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features erect stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated margins and hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers, which appear in clusters, consist of two ray florets and numerous disk florets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
