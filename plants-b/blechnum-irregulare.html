<p>Blechnum irregulare, commonly known as the irregular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
