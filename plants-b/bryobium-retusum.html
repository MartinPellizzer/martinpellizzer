                    <h1>Bryobium retusum</h1>
<p>Bryobium retusum, commonly known as the smooth liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leafy structure and is typically found growing on moist, shaded surfaces such as rocks or soil. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having structures called thallus, which are differentiated into stem-like and leaf-like parts. Bryobium retusum thrives in humid environments and is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject in studies of bryophyte biology.</p>
