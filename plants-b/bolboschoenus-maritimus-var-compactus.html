                    <h1>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. compactus</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. compactus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal marshes.</p>
