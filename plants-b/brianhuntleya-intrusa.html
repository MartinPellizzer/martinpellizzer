                    <h1>Brianhuntleya intrusa</h1>
<p>Brianhuntleya intrusa, commonly known as the invasive swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is often classified as an invasive species due to its competitive nature and impact on native flora.</p>
