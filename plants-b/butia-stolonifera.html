                <h1>Butia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Butia stolonifera, commonly known as the areca palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustering growth habit and stiff, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are often consumed by wildlife. Butia stolonifera is adapted to dry and tropical climates, making it a hardy and drought-resistant plant.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth pattern allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its natural habitat.</p>
