                    <h1>Bromus sitchensis var. carinatus</h1>
<p>Bromus sitchensis var. carinatus, commonly known as the Sitka bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
