                    <h1>Barkhausia nigricans</h1>
<p>Barkhausia nigricans, commonly known as the black bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark, almost black, upper surface with a dense, leathery texture, while its lower surface is lighter and more porous. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecological health.</p>
