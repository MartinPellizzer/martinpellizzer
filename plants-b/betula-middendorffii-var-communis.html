                    <h1>Betula middendorffii var. communis</h1>
<p>Betula middendorffii var. communis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions.</p>
