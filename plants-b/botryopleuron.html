<p>Botryopleuron, commonly known as the "bushy bladder" or "bladderworts," is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing tiny aquatic organisms. Botryopleuron species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. They are carnivorous, relying on the trapped prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Their botanical features include delicate, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
