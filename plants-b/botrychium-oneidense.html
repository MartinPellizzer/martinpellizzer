                    <h1>Botrychium oneidense</h1>
<p>Botrychium oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, club-like structure at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
