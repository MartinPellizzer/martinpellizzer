<p>Bulbophyllum gymnopus, commonly known as the slender lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated flowers with a narrow, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers are often pale green or yellow, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
