                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum f. occidentale</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum f. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>This fern is noted for its primitive morphology and is considered a relict species with limited distribution.</p>
