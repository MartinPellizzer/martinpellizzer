<p>Baeria maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green leaves, which are adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Baeria maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
