<p>Bromus × robustus, commonly known as the robust brome, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Bromus catharticus and Bromus rigidus.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Bromus × robustus is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
