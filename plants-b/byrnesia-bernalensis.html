                    <h1>Byrnesia bernalensis</h1>
<p>Byrnesia bernalensis, commonly known as the Bernal's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Baccharis*, through specialized roots called haustelia. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Byrnesia bernalensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for avian species.</p>
