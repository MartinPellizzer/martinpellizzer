<p>Bassia scoparia subsp.</p>
<p>culta, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its bushy, spiny structure and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the formation of dry, papery fruits that easily detach and scatter seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>The plant's unique life cycle and ecological impact have made it a subject of both botanical study and environmental concern.</p>
