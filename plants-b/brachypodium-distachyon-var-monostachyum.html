                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. monostachyum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. monostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically arranged in a single, dense spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic simplicity and potential use in ecological and agricultural research.</p>
