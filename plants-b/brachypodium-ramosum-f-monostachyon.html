                    <h1>Brachypodium ramosum f. monostachyon</h1>
<p>Brachypodium ramosum f. monostachyon, commonly known as the single-stem brachypodium, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant exhibits a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender spikelet at the apex of the stem. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are typically green or pale brown, and it is often found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological simplicity and potential for use in ecological and agricultural research.</p>
