<p>Betula arguta, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula arguta produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh environments, often growing in tundra, taiga, and rocky soils.</p>
