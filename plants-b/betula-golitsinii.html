                    <h1>Betula golitsinii</h1>
<p>Betula golitsinii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula golitsinii is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures.</p>
