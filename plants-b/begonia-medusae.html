<p>Begonia medusae, commonly known as the jellyfish begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often waxy leaves that resemble the appearance of jellyfish, hence its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. Begonia medusae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its foliage is not only visually appealing but also serves as a habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
