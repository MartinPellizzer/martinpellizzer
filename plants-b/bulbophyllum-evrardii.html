<p>Bulbophyllum evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent pseudobulbs and elongated, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
