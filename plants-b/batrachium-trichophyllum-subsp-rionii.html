<p>Batrachium trichophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>rionii, commonly known as the Rion Ridge fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in anchoring it to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
