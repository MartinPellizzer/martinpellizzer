<p>Bulbophyllum boonjee, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green tones. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
