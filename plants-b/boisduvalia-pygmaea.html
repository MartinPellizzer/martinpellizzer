                    <h1>Boisduvalia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Boisduvalia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf boisduvalia, is a small shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, evergreen foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
