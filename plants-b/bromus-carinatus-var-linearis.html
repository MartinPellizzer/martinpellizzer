                    <h1>Bromus carinatus var. linearis</h1>
<p>Bromus carinatus var. linearis, commonly known as the linear brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous awned florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion.</p>
