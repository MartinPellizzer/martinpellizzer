<p>Bucculina, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>These organisms are characterized by their soft, often colorful bodies and the presence of a specialized siphon for respiration and feeding. They are found in various marine environments, including coral reefs and seagrass beds, and play a role in the ecosystem as both herbivores and detritivores. Bucculina species are known for their ability to secrete a mucus that helps them move and protect themselves from predators.</p>
