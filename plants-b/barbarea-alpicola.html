                    <h1>Barbarea alpicola</h1>
<p>Barbarea alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually basal, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
