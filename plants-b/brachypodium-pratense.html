                    <h1>Brachypodium pratense</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pratense, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Brachypodium pratense is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
