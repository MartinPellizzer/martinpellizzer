                    <h1>Brachiaria breviglumis</h1>
<p>Brachiaria breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in pastureland due to its hardiness and nutritional value for livestock.</p>
<p>Brachiaria breviglumis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas.</p>
