                    <h1>Barbarea rupestris</h1>
<p>Barbarea rupestris, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Barbarea rupestris is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
