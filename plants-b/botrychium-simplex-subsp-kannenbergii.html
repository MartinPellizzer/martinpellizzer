<p>Botrychium simplex subsp.</p>
<p>kannenbergii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, shade-tolerant fern native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, orbicular fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores in clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
