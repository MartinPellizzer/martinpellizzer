                    <h1>Bulbophyllum planitiae</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum planitiae, commonly known as the "Borneo ghost orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive lip. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
