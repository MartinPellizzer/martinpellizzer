                    <h1>Betula asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Betula asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are alternate and finely divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The bark is smooth and typically white or pale gray, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
