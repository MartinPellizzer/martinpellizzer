                    <h1>Botrychium lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy moonwort, is a small fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a unique structure with a fleshy, leaf-like frond that is covered in soft, downy hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. Its leaves are usually divided into several segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Botrychium lanuginosum is often found in woodland areas and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
