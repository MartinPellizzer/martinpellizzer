<p>Betula utilis subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish or reddish inner layer.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests and rocky slopes.</p>
