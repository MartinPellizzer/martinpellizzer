                    <h1>Bidens heterodoxa var. atheistica</h1>
<p>Bidens heterodoxa var. atheistica, commonly known as the Atheist's Burdock, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features distinctive yellow flowers with ray-like petals and a rough, lobed leaf structure typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals and wind. Its name reflects its association with areas where religious beliefs are less prevalent, though this is more of a cultural designation than a botanical one.</p>
<p>The species is known for its resilience in harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and high temperatures.</p>
