<p>Becium urundense, commonly known as the Brazilian cactus, is a species native to the Brazilian state of Bahia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Becium urundense is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry forests and shrublands.</p>
