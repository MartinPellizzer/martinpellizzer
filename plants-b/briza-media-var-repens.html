<p>Briza media var. repens, commonly known as the running bamboo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that form dense mats, often spreading via rhizomes to create a carpet-like appearance. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small, spike-like clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
