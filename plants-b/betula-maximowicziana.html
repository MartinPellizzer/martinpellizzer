<p>Betula maximowicziana, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and pink, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula maximowicziana is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures.</p>
