<p>Bulbophyllum mangoroanum, commonly known as the Mangoroan Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This orchid is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution.</p>
