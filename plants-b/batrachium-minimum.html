                    <h1>Batrachium minimum</h1>
<p>Batrachium minimum, commonly known as the small frog orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its diminutive size and cryptic appearance make it challenging to spot, contributing to its status as a poorly understood species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical gem from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
