<p>Besleria ampla, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow blossoms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Besleria ampla is considered a conservation concern.</p>
