<p>Baccharis altimontana, commonly known as the mountain baccharis, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Baccharis altimontana is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
