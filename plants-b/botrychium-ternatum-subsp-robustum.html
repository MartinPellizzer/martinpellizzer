<p>Botrychium ternatum subsp.</p>
<p>robustum, commonly known as the broadleaf moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas, and is found across parts of North America. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its robust growth compared to other members of the Botrychium genus.</p>
