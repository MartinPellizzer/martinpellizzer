                    <h1>Bromus lloydianus</h1>
<p>Bromus lloydianus, commonly known as Lloyd's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous spikelets. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and low nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus lloydianus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
