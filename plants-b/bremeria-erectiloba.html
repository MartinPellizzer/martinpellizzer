<p>Bremeria erectiloba, commonly known as the erect-leaved bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are pollinated by wind. Bremeria erectiloba is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural research.</p>
