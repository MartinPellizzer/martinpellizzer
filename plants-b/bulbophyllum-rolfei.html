                    <h1>Bulbophyllum rolfei</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum rolfei, commonly known as the Rolfe's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and its striking, pale yellow and pink flower spikes that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bulbophyllum rolfei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
