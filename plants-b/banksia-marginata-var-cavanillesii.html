                    <h1>Banksia marginata var. cavanillesii</h1>
<p>Banksia marginata var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in spring. The plant is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is drought-tolerant once established. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native wildlife.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to the typical Banksia marginata.</p>
