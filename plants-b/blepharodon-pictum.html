                    <h1>Blepharodon pictum</h1>
<p>Blepharodon pictum, commonly known as the painted fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a gradient of colors from deep green to rust-red. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's intricate leaf patterns make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the undersides of its fronds.</p>
