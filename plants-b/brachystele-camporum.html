<p>Brachystele camporum, commonly known as the Campora stiltroot, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and specialized root structures that help it anchor in wet, muddy environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Brachystele camporum is adapted to thrive in swampy or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
