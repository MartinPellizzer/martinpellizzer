                    <h1>Bulbophyllum maculosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum maculosum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
