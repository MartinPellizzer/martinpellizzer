                    <h1>Bulbophyllum dendrochiloides</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum dendrochiloides, commonly known as the tree-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a tree branch.</p>
<p>This species is appreciated for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
