                    <h1>Bejaria dryanderae</h1>
<p>Bejaria dryanderae, commonly known as the dryandra or the pink ghost flower, is a striking plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in heathland and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Bejaria dryanderae is also notable for its unique floral structure, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
