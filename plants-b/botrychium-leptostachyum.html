The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can thrive in the presence of adequate moisture. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the sporangia arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern along the sporophyll.</p>
<p>Botrychium leptostachyum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
