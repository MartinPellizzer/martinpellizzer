                    <h1>Bosqueia calcicola</h1>
<p>Bosqueia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bosqueia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Bosqueia calcicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
