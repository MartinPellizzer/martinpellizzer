                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. asperum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. asperum, commonly known as rough bristlegrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, rough-textured leaves and produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and genetic similarity to other Brachypodium species, it is also used in plant research for studying grass genetics and stress responses.</p>
