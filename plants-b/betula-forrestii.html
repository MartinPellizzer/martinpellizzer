                    <h1>Betula forrestii</h1>
<p>Betula forrestii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes in regions like Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Betula forrestii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique aesthetic.</p>
