                    <h1>Berberis buxifolia var. gracilior</h1>
<p>Berberis buxifolia var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender leaf barberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>The varietal form gracilior is distinguished by its more refined, slender leaves, giving it a more elegant appearance compared to the standard species.</p>
