                    <h1>Banksia gibbosa</h1>
<p>Banksia gibbosa, commonly known as the zigzag banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia gibbosa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
