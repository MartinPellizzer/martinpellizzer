<p>Brickellia reticulata, commonly known as the Mexican heath or brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Brickellia reticulata is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
