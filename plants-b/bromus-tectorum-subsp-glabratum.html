<p>Bromus tectorum subsp.</p>
<p>glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous cheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as prairies and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, pale green spikelets that mature into seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can dominate native plant communities and contribute to ecosystem changes.</p>
