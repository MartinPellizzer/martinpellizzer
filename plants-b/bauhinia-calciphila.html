                    <h1>Bauhinia calciphila</h1>
<p>Bauhinia calciphila, commonly known as the limestone bauhinia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, making it a notable example of a calciphile species. The plant produces distinctive papery, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale pink or white, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Bauhinia calciphila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
