<p>Bromus rigidus subsp.</p>
<p>ambigens, commonly known as the rigid brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and can be considered a weed in some agricultural contexts.</p>
