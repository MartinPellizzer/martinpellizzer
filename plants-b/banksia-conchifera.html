                    <h1>Banksia conchifera</h1>
<p>Banksia conchifera, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Banksia conchifera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
