<p>Blossfeldia liliputana var. fechseri, commonly known as the miniature Christmas cactus, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, branching stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces flowers in a raceme, with each bloom opening sequentially, creating a cascading effect. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and seasonal blooming, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
