<p>Begonia lemurica, commonly known as the lemuriang begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green veins and pale yellow margins. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Begonia lemurica is considered an endangered species.</p>
