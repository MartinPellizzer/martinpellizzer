                    <h1>Breynia asymmetrica</h1>
<p>Breynia asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric breynia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, asymmetric growth pattern, with branches that twist and curve in unusual directions. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Breynia asymmetrica is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
