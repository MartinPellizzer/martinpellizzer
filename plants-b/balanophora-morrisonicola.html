                    <h1>Balanophora morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Balanophora morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
