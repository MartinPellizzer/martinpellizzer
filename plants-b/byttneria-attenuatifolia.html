<p>Byttneria attenuatifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The wood of Byttneria attenuatifolia is valued for its durability and fine texture, though it is not commonly used in commercial forestry.</p>
