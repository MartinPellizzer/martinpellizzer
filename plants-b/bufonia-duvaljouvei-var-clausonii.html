<p>Bufonia duvaljouvei var. clausonii, commonly known as the Duval's bufonia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
