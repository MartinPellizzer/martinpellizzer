                    <h1>Bulbophyllum medusella</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum medusella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a ghostly appearance. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
