<p>Burbidgea nitida, commonly known as the silky burbidgea, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Burbidgea nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
