                    <h1>Bougainvillea stipitata var. stuckertiana</h1>
<p>Bougainvillea stipitata var. stuckertiana, commonly known as the Stuckert's Bougainvillea, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
