                    <h1>Biasolettia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Biasolettia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones bearing numerous seeds enclosed in fleshy, red or orange arils. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
