                    <h1>Bougainvillea stipitata var. kuntzeana</h1>
<p>Bougainvillea stipitata var. kuntzeana, commonly known as the red-blossom bougainvillea, is a vibrant flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of colorful bracts that range from pink to red, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features slender, woody stems and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers inside the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and ability to climb or be trained into shapes.</p>
