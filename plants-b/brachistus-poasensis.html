<p>Brachistus poasensis, commonly known as the Po√°s bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are adapted to cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Brachistus poasensis is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
