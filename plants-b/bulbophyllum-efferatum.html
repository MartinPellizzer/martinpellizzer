                    <h1>Bulbophyllum efferatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum efferatum, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
