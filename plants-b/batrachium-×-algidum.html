                    <h1>Batrachium × algidum</h1>
<p>Batrachium × algidum, commonly known as the cold mountain fern, is a hybrid species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow under moonlight. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Batrachium × algidum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
