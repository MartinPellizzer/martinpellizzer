<p>Bathiorchis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they thrive in cool, moist environments. Bathiorchis species have small, strap-like leaves and produce showy, colorful blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species are rare and face threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
