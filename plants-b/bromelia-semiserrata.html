<p>Bromelia semiserrata, commonly known as the serrated bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Bromelia semiserrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
