                    <h1>Brachypodium dalmaticum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium dalmaticum, commonly known as the Mediterranean grass or dwarf brome, is a small annual grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature, with slender,丛生 shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
