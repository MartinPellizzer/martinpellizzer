<p>Biscutella tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the European Alps.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, grayish foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Biscutella tomentosa is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine meadows and limestone soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
