                    <h1>Botrychium simplex var. laxifolium</h1>
<p>Botrychium simplex var. laxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moonwort, is a fern-like species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, with the lower leaves being smaller and more elongated. The plant produces a single, unbranched sporophyll that bears spores on its underside, typical of its reproductive structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more loosely spaced leaves compared to the typical form of Botrychium simplex.</p>
