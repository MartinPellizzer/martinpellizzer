<p>Balsamea fraxinoides, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The wood is strong and durable, historically used for furniture and cabinetry.</p>
