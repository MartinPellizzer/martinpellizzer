<p>Barbarea intermedia var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
