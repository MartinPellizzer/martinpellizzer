                    <h1>Buxus bartlettii</h1>
<p>Buxus bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's boxwood, is a rare and critically endangered evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and slow growth rate, which makes it highly valued for ornamental purposes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its small, oval leaves are dark green and glossy, providing a dense, decorative appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
