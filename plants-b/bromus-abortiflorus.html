<p>Bromus abortiflorus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a species of grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus abortiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native environment.</p>
