<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are usually silver-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Baccharis scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
