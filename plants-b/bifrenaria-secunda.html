                    <h1>Bifrenaria secunda</h1>
<p>Bifrenaria secunda, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single flower spike with several blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifrenaria secunda is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
