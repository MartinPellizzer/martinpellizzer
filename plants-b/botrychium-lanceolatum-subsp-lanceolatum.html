<p>Botrychium lanceolatum subsp.</p>
<p>lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped sporangiophores that are often covered in a dense layer of spores.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually reduced to a narrow, blade-like structure, with the sporangia borne on specialized stalks.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its primitive morphology and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
