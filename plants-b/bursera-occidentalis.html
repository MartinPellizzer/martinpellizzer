                    <h1>Bursera occidentalis</h1>
<p>Bursera occidentalis, commonly known as the ocot√°n, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the dry forests of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The plant has a dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that exfoliates to reveal a reddish inner layer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bursera occidentalis produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
