                    <h1>Buxus microphylla f. tenuis</h1>
<p>Buxus microphylla f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, slow-growing foliage.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Buxus microphylla, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. It is well-suited for topiary and formal garden designs due to its ability to maintain a neat shape.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
