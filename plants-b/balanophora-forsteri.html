                    <h1>Balanophora forsteri</h1>
<p>Balanophora forsteri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
