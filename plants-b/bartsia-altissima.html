<p>Bartsia altissima, commonly known as the tall bartsia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in whorls along the stem, and are usually pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Bartsia altissima is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
