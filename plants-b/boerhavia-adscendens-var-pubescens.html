                    <h1>Boerhavia adscendens var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Boerhavia adscendens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a similar pubescent coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
