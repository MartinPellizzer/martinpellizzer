                    <h1>Begonia prasinimarginata</h1>
<p>Begonia prasinimarginata, commonly known as the Emerald Margin Begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
