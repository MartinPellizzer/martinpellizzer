<p>Bulbophyllum olivinum subsp.</p>
<p>linguiferum, commonly known as the tongue-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that have a distinctive, elongated lip resembling a tongue. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
