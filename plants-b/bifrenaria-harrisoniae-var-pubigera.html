                    <h1>Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. pubigera</h1>
<p>Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. pubigera, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spiky female cones, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
