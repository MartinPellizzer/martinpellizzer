                    <h1>Botria</h1>
<p>Botria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant's leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Botria flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom only once in the plant's lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Botria is considered a delicately balanced species in its ecosystem.</p>
