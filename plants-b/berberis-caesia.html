                    <h1>Berberis caesia</h1>
<p>Berberis caesia, commonly known as the blue barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking blue-green color in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit.</p>
