                    <h1>Betula tiulinae</h1>
<p>Betula tiulinae, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping.</p>
<p>Betula tiulinae is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures.</p>
