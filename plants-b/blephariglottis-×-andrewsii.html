                    <h1>Blephariglottis × andrewsii</h1>
<p>Blephariglottis × andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrews' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host tree.</p>
