                    <h1>Bromus × laagei</h1>
<p>Bromus × laagei, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a perennial grass species that results from the natural hybridization between Bromus catharticus and Bromus mollis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and typically produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Bromus × laagei is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
