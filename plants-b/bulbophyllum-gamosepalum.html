<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapting to its tropical and subtropical habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
