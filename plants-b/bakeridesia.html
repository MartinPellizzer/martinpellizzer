                    <h1>Bakeridesia</h1>
<p>Bakeridesia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Asclepias and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bakeridesia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies.</p>
