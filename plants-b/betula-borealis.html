                    <h1>Betula borealis</h1>
<p>Betula borealis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in full sun. Its small, triangular leaves turn yellow in the fall before dropping, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Betula borealis plays an important ecological role in boreal and temperate forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
