<p>Bulbophyllum smithianum, commonly known as the Smith's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
