<p>Brachyderea chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Brachyderea chondrilloides is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
