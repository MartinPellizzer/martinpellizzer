                    <h1>Brochosiphon</h1>
<p>Brochosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of Africa. They are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray flowers surrounded by a dense ring of bracts that resemble leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Brochosiphon species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in coastal conditions.</p>
