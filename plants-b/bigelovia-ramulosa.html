                    <h1>Bigelovia ramulosa</h1>
<p>Bigelovia ramulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf bigelovia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, providing additional insulation against extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Bigelovia ramulosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
