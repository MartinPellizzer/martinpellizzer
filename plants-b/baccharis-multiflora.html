<p>Baccharis multiflora, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments.

<p>Baccharis multiflora is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
