                    <h1>Bromus spicatus</h1>
<p>Bromus spicatus, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of spikelets at the top of the stem. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Bromus spicatus is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly.</p>
