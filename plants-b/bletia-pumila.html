                    <h1>Bletia pumila</h1>
<p>Bletia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or small orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small plant, typically growing to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with a single stem bearing several narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the summer months. Bletia pumila is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
