                    <h1>Bromidium hygrometricum var. breviaristatum</h1>
<p>Bromidium hygrometricum var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the compact bromeliad, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically broad, fleshy, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink or white, emerging from the leaf axils.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
