                    <h1>Bargemontia clivicola</h1>
<p>Bargemontia clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-dwelling bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bargemontia clivicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for local pollinators.</p>
