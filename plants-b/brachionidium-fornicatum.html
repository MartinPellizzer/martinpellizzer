<p>Brachionidium fornicatum, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, fleshy leaves and a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of longleaf pines in the Florida scrub ecosystem. Its delicate structure and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
