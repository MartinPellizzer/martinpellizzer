                    <h1>Boswellia balsamifera</h1>
<p>Boswellia balsamifera, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped from the bark, which solidifies into frankincense when exposed to air. This resin has been used for centuries in incense, medicine, and religious rituals.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Burseraceae family and is closely related to other frankincense-producing species.</p>
