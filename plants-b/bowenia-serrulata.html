                    <h1>Bowenia serrulata</h1>
<p>Bowenia serrulata, commonly known as the Queensland cycad, is a unique cycad species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
