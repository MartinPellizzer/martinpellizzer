                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. lloydianus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. lloydianus, commonly known as the Lloyd's bluebunch brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in open meadows, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
