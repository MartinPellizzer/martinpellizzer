                    <h1>Batrachium heterophyllum f. truncatum</h1>
<p>Batrachium heterophyllum f. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated batrachium, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) leaf tips, which set it apart from other members of the genus. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
