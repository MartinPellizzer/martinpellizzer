<p>Bellevalia pieridis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Bellevalia pieridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
