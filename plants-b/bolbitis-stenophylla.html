                    <h1>Bolbitis stenophylla</h1>
<p>Bolbitis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats on the water's surface. Its fronds are usually divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Bolbitis stenophylla is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions.</p>
