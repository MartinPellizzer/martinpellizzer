                    <h1>Bulbophyllum albidum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum albidum, commonly known as the white bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces numerous small, white flowers along its stems. The plant features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum albidum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
