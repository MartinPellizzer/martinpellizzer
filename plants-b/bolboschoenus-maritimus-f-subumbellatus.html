                    <h1>Bolboschoenus maritimus f. subumbellatus</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus f. subumbellatus, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a variant of the marsh grass that thrives in brackish and saline wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that form compact, umbrella-like clusters, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic environment. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland species.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to coastal and estuarine conditions.</p>
