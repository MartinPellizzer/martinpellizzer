<p>Bromus squarrosus var. megastachys, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with spikelets that are often bristling with long, awned lemmas. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is commonly found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
