                    <h1>Bouteloua pubescens</h1>
<p>Bouteloua pubescens, commonly known as hairy grama, is a native grass species found throughout the central and southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically brown or tan in color. Hairy grama is drought-tolerant and often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
