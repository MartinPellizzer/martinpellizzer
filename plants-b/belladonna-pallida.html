                    <h1>Belladonna pallida</h1>
<p>Belladonna pallida, commonly known as the pale belladonna, is a striking member of the Solanaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>This perennial herb features smooth, dark green leaves that are ovate in shape and often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is its large, showy flowers, which are typically pale to deep purple in color and bloom in late summer. The plant produces rounded, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its potent alkaloids, it is considered a highly poisonous plant, requiring caution in both cultivation and handling.</p>
