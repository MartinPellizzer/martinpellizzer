<p>Bryonia guineensis, commonly known as African bryony, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that give way to orange, spiny fruits. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its poisonous nature, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern herbal practices.</p>
