<p>Brachycorythis allisonii, commonly known as the Allison's dwarf cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected under various conservation programs.</p>
