<p>Bulbophyllum adolinae, commonly known as the Adolina's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
