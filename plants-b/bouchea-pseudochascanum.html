<p>Bouchea pseudochascanum, commonly known as the desert cholla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bouchea pseudochascanum is well adapted to desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
