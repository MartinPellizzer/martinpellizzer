                    <h1>Begonia rex</h1>
<p>Begonia rex, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that exhibit a kaleidoscope of colors, including shades of red, purple, pink, and green. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and prefers bright, indirect light to thrive. Its foliage is the main attraction, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are less showy than its vibrant leaves.</p>
<p>Begonia rex is popular in indoor gardening due to its ability to add dramatic visual interest to any space.</p>
