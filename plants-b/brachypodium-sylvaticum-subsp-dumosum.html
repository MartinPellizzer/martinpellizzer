<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp.</p>
<p>dumosum, commonly known as the tussock bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit, with dense, tussock-like tufts of leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of the main species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
