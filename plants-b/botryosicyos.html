<p>Botryosicyos, commonly known as the African bottle tree, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to its arid native habitat in sub-Saharan Africa. The plant produces large, palmate leaves and yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruits are cylindrical, green pods that contain edible seeds.</p>
<p>Botryosicyos is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>
