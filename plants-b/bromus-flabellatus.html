                    <h1>Bromus flabellatus</h1>
<p>Bromus flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Bromus flabellatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
