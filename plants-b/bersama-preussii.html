                    <h1>Bersama preussii</h1>
<p>Bersama preussii, commonly known as the Preussii broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various grasses and herbs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
