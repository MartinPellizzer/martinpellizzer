<p>Bulbophyllum absconditum subsp.</p>
<p>hastula, commonly known as the hidden bulbophyllum, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow.</p>
