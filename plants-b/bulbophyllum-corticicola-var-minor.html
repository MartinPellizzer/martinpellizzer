<p>Bulbophyllum corticicola var. minor, commonly known as the minor bark orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, hairy tissue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
