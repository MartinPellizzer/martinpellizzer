                    <h1>Bromheadia benchaii</h1>
<p>Bromheadia benchaii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Hainan in China and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Bromheadia benchaii is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the evolution and conservation of cycads in tropical ecosystems.</p>
