                    <h1>Bromus tomentellus var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Bromus tomentellus var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly seeds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
