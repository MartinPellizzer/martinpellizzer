                    <h1>Berberis × ottawensis</h1>
<p>Berberis × ottawensis, commonly known as the Ottawa barberry, is a hybrid shrub resulting from the cross between Berberis thunbergii and Berberis darwinii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for gardens in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often managed carefully to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
