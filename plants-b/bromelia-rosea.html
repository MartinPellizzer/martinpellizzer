                    <h1>Bromelia rosea</h1>
<p>Bromelia rosea, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, red-pink bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Bromelia rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
