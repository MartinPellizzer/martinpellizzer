                    <h1>Betula insignis</h1>
<p>Betula insignis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery strips, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This hardy species thrives in harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
