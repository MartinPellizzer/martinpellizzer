                    <h1>Bassia pallida</h1>
<p>Bassia pallida, commonly known as the pale bassia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that aids in reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bassia pallida is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
