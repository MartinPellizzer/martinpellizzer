                    <h1>Bennettiodendron subracemosum</h1>
<p>Bennettiodendron subracemosum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if not managed carefully.</p>
