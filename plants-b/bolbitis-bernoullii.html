                    <h1>Bolbitis bernoullii</h1>
<p>Bolbitis bernoullii, commonly known as the golden humped fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often golden-yellow fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic matter in the soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis bernoullii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
