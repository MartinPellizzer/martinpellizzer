                    <h1>Baccharis × heeringiana</h1>
<p>Baccharis × heeringiana, commonly known as the hybrid baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptability.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Baccharis × heeringiana results from crosses between Baccharis halimifolia and Baccharis salicifolia.</p>
