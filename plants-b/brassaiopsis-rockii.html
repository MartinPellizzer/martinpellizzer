                    <h1>Brassaiopsis rockii</h1>
<p>Brassaiopsis rockii, commonly known as the rock cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the rocky habitats of southern China.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful management to ensure its survival.</p>
