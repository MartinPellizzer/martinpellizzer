<p>Brachyelytrum aristosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass or the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Brachyelytrum aristosum is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
