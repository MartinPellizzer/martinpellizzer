<p>Bulbophyllum flavidiflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal climates. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that are typically fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
