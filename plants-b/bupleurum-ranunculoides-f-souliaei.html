<p>Bupleurum ranunculoides f. souliaei, commonly known as the souliaei buttercup, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like foliage that gives it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
