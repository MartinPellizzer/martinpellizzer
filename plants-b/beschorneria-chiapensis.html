                    <h1>Beschorneria chiapensis</h1>
<p>Beschorneria chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas cycad, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of long, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its foliage is evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
