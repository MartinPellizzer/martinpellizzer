<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Biotia latifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
