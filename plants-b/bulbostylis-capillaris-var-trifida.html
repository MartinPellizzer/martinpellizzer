                    <h1>Bulbostylis capillaris var. trifida</h1>
<p>Bulbostylis capillaris var. trifida, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) bracts, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
