                    <h1>Birostula</h1>
<p>Birostula, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, misty forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Birostula thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
