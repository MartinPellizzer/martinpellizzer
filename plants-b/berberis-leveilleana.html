<p>Berberis leveilleana, commonly known as the Andes barberry, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often sour. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
