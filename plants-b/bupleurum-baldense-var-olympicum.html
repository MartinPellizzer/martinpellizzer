<p>Bupleurum baldense var. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic Bupleurum, is a rare variant of the Bupleurum genus native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
