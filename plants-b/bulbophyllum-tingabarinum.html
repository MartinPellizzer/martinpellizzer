                    <h1>Bulbophyllum tingabarinum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum tingabarinum, commonly known as the Tingabari orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
