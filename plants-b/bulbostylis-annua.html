The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in humid environments.</p>
