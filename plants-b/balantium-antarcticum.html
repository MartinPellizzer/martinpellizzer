                    <h1>Balantium antarcticum</h1>
<p>Balantium antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae.</p>
<p>It thrives in extreme environments, particularly in the cold and dry regions of Antarctica. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rocky surfaces. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is one of the few organisms capable of surviving in such extreme conditions.</p>
