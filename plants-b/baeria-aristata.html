                <h1>Baeria aristata</h1>
<p>Baeria aristata, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to poor soil conditions and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Baeria aristata is often used in landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value in dry climates.</p>
