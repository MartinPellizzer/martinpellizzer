                    <h1>Boerhavia squarrosa</h1>
<p>Boerhavia squarrosa, commonly known as the redroot sandplume, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Boerhavia squarrosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
