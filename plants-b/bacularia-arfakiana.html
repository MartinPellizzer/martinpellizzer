<p>Bacularia arfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak Island fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Arfak in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bacularia arfakiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
