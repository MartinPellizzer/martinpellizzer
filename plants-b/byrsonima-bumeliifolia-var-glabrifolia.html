                    <h1>Byrsonima bumeliifolia var. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Byrsonima bumeliifolia var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua√ßu* tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It features a dense canopy with elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, hairy fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange as they ripen. The fruits are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various wildlife species and its contribution to the biodiversity of the Amazon.</p>
