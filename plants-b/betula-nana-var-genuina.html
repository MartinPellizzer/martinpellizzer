<p>Betula nana var. genuina, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Betula nana var. genuina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and alpine species.</p>
