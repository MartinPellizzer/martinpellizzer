                    <h1>Briquetastrum</h1>
<p>Briquetastrum, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosettes of thick, velvety leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically succulent, which helps the plant store water in its arid native environment. Briquetastrum species are popular houseplants due to their attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
