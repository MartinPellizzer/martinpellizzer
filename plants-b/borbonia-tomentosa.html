<p>Borbonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly borbonia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it a unique and soft appearance.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
