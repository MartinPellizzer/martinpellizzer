                    <h1>Bulbophyllum crocodilus</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum crocodilus, commonly known as the crocodile orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that are often yellow or orange, with intricate patterns resembling scales or spots. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This epiphytic orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
