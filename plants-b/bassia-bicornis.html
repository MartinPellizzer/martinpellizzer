<p>Bassia bicornis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally small, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Bassia bicornis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
