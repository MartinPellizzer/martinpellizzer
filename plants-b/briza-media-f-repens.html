<p>Briza media f. repens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that becomes more intense in full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
