                    <h1>Bernoullia swietenioides</h1>
<p>Bernoullia swietenioides, commonly known as the Swietenioides fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bernoullia swietenioides is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
