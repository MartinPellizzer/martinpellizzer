                    <h1>Billbergia × wittmackiana</h1>
<p>Billbergia × wittmackiana, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid bromeliad that results from the cross between Billbergia nutans and Billbergia cucullata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that display a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a decorative foliage plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
