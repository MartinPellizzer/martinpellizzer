                    <h1>Botelua</h1>
<p>Botelua, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a distinctive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The tree has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its woody structure.</p>
<p>Botelua is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
