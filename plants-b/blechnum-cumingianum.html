                    <h1>Blechnum cumingianum</h1>
<p>Blechnum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization.</p>
