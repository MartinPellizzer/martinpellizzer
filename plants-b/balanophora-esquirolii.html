                    <h1>Balanophora esquirolii</h1>
<p>Balanophora esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and difficult to study in the wild.</p>
