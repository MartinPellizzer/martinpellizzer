<p>Bilabrella confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in forested areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate white flower that blooms in late summer. It is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its roots rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bilabrella confusa is considered an endangered species.</p>
