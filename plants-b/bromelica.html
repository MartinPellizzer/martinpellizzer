                    <h1>Bromelica</h1>
<p>Bromelica, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water. The plant produces a flowering spike that eventually leads to the formation of the familiar pineapple fruit. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Bromelica is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded areas, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
