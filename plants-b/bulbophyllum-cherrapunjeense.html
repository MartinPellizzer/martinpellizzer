<p>Bulbophyllum cherrapunjeense, commonly known as the Cherrapunji orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its challenging habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
