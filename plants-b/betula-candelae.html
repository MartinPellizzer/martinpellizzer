                    <h1>Betula candelae</h1>
<p>Betula candelae, commonly known as the candlewood birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, candle-like branches that give it a striking appearance, especially when covered in snow. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Betula candelae is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold climates with well-drained soils.</p>
