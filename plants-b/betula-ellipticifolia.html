                    <h1>Betula ellipticifolia</h1>
<p>Betula ellipticifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slight reddish tint, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Betula ellipticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
