                    <h1>Brachypodium montanum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium montanum, commonly known as mountain bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Brachypodium montanum is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
