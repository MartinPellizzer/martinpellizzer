                    <h1>Betula × atrata</h1>
<p>Betula × atrata, commonly known as the black birch or ironwood birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula nigra and Betula alleghaniensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that is smooth and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula × atrata is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas.</p>
