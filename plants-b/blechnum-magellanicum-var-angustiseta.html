                    <h1>Blechnum magellanicum var. angustiseta</h1>
<p>Blechnum magellanicum var. angustiseta, commonly known as the narrow-seta blechnum, is a fern native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The varietal name "angustiseta" refers to its narrow, bristle-like setae, which are structures involved in spore dispersal.</p>
