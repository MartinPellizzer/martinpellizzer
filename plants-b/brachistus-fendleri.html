                    <h1>Brachistus fendleri</h1>
<p>Brachistus fendleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Brachistus fendleri is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
