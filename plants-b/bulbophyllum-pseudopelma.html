                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pseudopelma</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pseudopelma, commonly known as the False Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a lip that is highly specialized for pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild.</p>
