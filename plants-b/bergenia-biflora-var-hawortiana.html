                    <h1>Bergenia biflora var. hawortiana</h1>
<p>Bergenia biflora var. hawortiana, commonly known as the Hawort's bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces dense clusters of dark red to purple flowers in early spring. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
