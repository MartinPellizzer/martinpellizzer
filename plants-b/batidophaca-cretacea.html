<p>Batidophaca cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of modern ferns. The plant's structure suggests it was adapted to moist, temperate environments, likely near water sources. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features provide valuable insights into the flora of ancient Earth.</p>
