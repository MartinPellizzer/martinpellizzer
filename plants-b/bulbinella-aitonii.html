                    <h1>Bulbinella aitonii</h1>
<p>Bulbinella aitonii, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces showy, pink or purple flowers during late summer to autumn. The plant thrives in rocky or cliff faces, where it attaches itself to trees or stones using its root system. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.</p>
