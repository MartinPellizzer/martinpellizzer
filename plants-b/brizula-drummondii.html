<p>Brizula drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Brizula drummondii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive in conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
