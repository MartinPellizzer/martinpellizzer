<p>Bicornella parvula, commonly known as the small two-horned fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact rhizome with two small, slender fronds that give it its characteristic name. The fronds are typically narrow and have a soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
