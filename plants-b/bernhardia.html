<p>Bernhardia, commonly known as the "blue bell" or "blue star," is a genus of flowering plants native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It consists of two species, Bernhardia corallina and Bernhardia grandiflora, both characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers. The plants are herbaceous perennials that thrive in woodland environments, often growing in partial shade. Their leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while their flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Bernhardia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
