                    <h1>Bondtia dempsteri</h1>
<p>Bondtia dempsteri, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, rounded form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruit, similar to a pomegranate, is ornamental and contains numerous tiny, edible seeds.</p>
<p>Bondtia dempsteri is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
