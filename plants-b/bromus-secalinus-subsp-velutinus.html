<p>Bromus secalinus subsp.</p>
<p>velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Velvet brome is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
