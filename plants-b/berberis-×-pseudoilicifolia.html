                    <h1>Berberis × pseudoilicifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis × pseudoilicifolia, commonly known as the hybrid barberry, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its spiny stems and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Berberis darwinii and Berberis lycium, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parent species. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
