<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, adding visual interest to rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Belloa subspicata is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
