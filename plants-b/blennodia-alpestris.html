<p>Blennodia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine blennosperma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, dry conditions at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Blennodia alpestris produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
