                    <h1>Bubon rigidum</h1>
<p>Bubon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid bubble cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Bubon rigidum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
