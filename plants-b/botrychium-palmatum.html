                    <h1>Botrychium palmatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium palmatum, commonly known as the palmate moonwort, is a fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are divided into finger-like segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Botrychium palmatum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
