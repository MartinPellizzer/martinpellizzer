<p>Buxus itremoensis, commonly known as the Iremo boxwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Buxaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and slow growth rate make it a unique ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buxus itremoensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
