                    <h1>Broughtonia fusca</h1>
<p>Broughtonia fusca, commonly known as the dwarf rainforest plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Broughtonia fusca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
