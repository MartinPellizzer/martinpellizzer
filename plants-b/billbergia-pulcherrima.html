                    <h1>Billbergia pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Billbergia pulcherrima, commonly known as the flamingo flower or red billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red bracts that resemble the feathers of a flamingo, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that collect water in a central cup, a feature common in many bromeliads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia pulcherrima is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
