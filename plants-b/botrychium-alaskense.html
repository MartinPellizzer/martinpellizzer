<p>Botrychium alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a single, erect, spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Botrychium alaskense is native to the northern regions of North America, including Alaska and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
