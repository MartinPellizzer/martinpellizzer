                            <h1>Belvisia Ruta-Muraria</h1>
<p>Common rue, scientifically known as Belvisia ruta-muraria, is a hardy perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark green leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant has a long history of use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its strong aromatic properties. Common rue thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical significance in both medicine and folklore adds to its enduring appeal among gardeners and herbalists alike.</p>
