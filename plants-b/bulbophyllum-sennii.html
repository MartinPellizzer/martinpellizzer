<p>Bulbophyllum sennii, commonly known as the Senn's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum sennii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
