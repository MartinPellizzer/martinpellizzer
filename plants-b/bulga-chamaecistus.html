                <h1>Bulga chamaecistus</h1>
<p>Bulga chamaecistus, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for alpine and rocky garden settings.</p>
<p>Bulga chamaecistus is often used in herbal medicine for its antiseptic and aromatic properties.</p>
