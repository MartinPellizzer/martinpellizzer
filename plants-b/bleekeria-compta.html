<p>Bleekeria compta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bleekeria, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bleekeria compta is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
