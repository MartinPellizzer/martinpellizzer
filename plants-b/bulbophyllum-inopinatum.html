                    <h1>Bulbophyllum inopinatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum inopinatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, often translucent flowers that bloom in a striking shade of white or pale pink. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage, adapting to its shaded, humid habitat. It is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
