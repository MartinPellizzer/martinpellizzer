<p>Betula davurica var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
