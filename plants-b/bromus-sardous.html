                    <h1>Bromus sardous</h1>
<p>Bromus sardous, commonly known as the Sardinian brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets.</p>
<p>Bromus sardous is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands.</p>
