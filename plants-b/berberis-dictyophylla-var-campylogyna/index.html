                            <h1>Berberis Dictyophylla Var. Campylogyna</h1>
<p>Coralberry, scientifically known as Berberis dictyophylla var. campylogyna, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. With its vibrant red berries and spiny foliage, it adds both color and texture to gardens and natural landscapes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for horticultural use. Its ornamental value is matched by its hardiness and ability to attract birds and other wildlife. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its sharp thorns and toxic berries.</p>
