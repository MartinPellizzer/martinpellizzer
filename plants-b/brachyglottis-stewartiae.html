<p>Brachyglottis stewartiae, commonly known as Stewart's brachyglottis, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
