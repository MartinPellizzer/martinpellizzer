<p>Bufonia arcuata, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Bufonia arcuata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is a relatively hardy species that plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
