                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but now widespread in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is highly invasive, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and early flowering make it a significant ecological concern in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The variety pubescens is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage compared to other forms of cheatgrass.</p>
