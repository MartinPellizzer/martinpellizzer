                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon f. pentastachyon</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon f. pentastachyon, commonly known as the pentastachyon form, is a variant of the wild ryegrass species characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a distinct inflorescence structure with five stamens instead of the typical two, giving it a more complex appearance. Botanically, it is notable for its compact growth habit and reduced stature compared to the standard species. It is often studied for its genetic and genomic similarities to wheat and other grasses, making it a valuable model organism.</p>
<p>The pentastachyon form is also of interest in plant breeding and functional genomics research.</p>
