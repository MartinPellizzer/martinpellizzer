<p>Blechnum occidentale var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
