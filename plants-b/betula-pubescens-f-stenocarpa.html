                    <h1>Betula pubescens f. stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-berried birch, is a shrub-like form of the silver birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow, and clustered fruiting bodies, which are distinct from the typical elongated cones of the main species. The plant has smooth, silver-white bark that peels in thin layers, and its leaves are oval with a doubly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>This form is particularly adapted to harsh environments and is an important component of forest understories.</p>
