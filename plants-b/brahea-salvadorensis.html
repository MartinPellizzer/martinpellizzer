                    <h1>Brahea salvadorensis</h1>
<p>Brahea salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvador pine, is a species of cycad native to El Salvador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones appearing at the base of the stem and female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Brahea salvadorensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
