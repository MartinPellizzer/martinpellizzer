<p>Betula incana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is typically smooth and pale, with a tendency to peel in thin layers.</p>
<p>Betula incana var. minor is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
