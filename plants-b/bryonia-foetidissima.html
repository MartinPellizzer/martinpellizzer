<p>Bryonia foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-yellow fruits. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern herbal practices.</p>
