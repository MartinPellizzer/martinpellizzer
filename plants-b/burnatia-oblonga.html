                    <h1>Burnatia oblonga</h1>
<p>Burnatia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burnet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine beds.</p>
<p>Burnatia oblonga is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
