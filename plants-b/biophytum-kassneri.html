<p>Biophytum kassneri, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
