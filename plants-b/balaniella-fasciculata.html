                    <h1>Balaniella fasciculata</h1>
<p>Balaniella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and absence of true leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with shrubs and grasses. Its unique reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small, dry seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
