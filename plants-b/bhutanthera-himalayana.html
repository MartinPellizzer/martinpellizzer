<p>Bhutanthera himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan bhutanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan and northeastern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats at high altitudes, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bhutanthera himalayana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
