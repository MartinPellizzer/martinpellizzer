<p>Begonia ripicola, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, Begonia ripicola is valued both for ornamental purposes and its ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
