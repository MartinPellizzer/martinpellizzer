                    <h1>Begonia retakensis</h1>
<p>Begonia retakensis, commonly known as the Taiti begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Begonia retakensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
