                    <h1>Brassica urbaniana</h1>
<p>Brassica urbaniana, commonly known as the urban cabbage, is a Brassicaceae family plant characterized by its compact, leafy growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically features dark green, thick leaves that are somewhat similar to those of other Brassica species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the mustard family. It is often found in urban environments, thriving in cracks and on buildings, making it a common weed in cities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study in urban botany.</p>
