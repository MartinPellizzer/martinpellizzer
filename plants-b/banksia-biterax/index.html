                            <h1>Banksia Biterax</h1>
<p>Banksia biterax is a striking plant native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is known for its unique cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its resilience to drought makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens. The plant's name comes from the Greek word "biskia," meaning a type of thorn, reflecting its tough, spiky appearance.</p>
