                    <h1>Bicuculla fungosa</h1>
<p>Bicuculla fungosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble fungi, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical structure includes a short stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
