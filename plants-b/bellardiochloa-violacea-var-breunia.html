<p>It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale purple to violet flowers, which are often mistaken for those of true bromes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is adapted to full sun.</p>
