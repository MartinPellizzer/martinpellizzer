<p>Bulbophyllum insipidum, commonly known as the pale bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a potted plant.</p>
