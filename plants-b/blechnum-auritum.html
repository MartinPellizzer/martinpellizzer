<p>Blechnum auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are pinnate and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Blechnum auritum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, evergreen foliage.</p>
