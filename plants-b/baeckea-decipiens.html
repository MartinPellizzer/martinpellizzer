<p>Baeckea decipiens, commonly known as the false waratah, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking, red or pink flower spikes that resemble those of the waratah. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Baeckea decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display.</p>
