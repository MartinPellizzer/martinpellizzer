                    <h1>Bremeria lantziana</h1>
<p>Bremeria lantziana, commonly known as the Lantz's bramble, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-chambered capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.</p>
<p>Bremeria lantziana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets.</p>
