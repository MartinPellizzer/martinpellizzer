                    <h1>Bromus sipyleus</h1>
<p>Bromus sipyleus, commonly known as the Sipley's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which aids in its spread across suitable environments.</p>
<p>Bromus sipyleus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
