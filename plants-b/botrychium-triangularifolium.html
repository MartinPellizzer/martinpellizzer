<p>Botrychium triangularifolium, commonly known as the triangular fern or the broad-leafed moonwort, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called soruses, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium triangularifolium is a shade-tolerant species that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
