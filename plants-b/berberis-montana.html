                    <h1>Berberis montana</h1>
<p>Berberis montana, commonly known as the Alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Berberis montana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
