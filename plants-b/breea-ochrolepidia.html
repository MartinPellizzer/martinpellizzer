<p>Breea ochrolepidia, commonly known as the yellow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a pale yellow to orange thallus with distinct, lobed structures. The plant's vegetative body consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
