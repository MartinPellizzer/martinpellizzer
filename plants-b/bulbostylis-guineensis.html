<p>Bulbostylis guineensis, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a small, annual grass species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Bulbostylis guineensis is often found in wetland areas and is adapted to seasonal flooding.</p>
