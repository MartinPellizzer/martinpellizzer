<p>Betula humilis f. calcarata, commonly known as the dwarf birch or mountain birch, is a shrub-like variant of the birch genus native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense thickets in alpine and subarctic regions. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually hairy, and it produces catkins that are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in poor, acidic soils and is often found in open, exposed habitats.</p>
<p>Betula humilis f. calcarata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine species.</p>
