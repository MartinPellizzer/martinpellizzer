                    <h1>Boerhavia gardneri</h1>
<p>Boerhavia gardneri, commonly known as the silverleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of the stinging nettle due to their similar appearance, though they lack the irritant compounds.</p>
<p>Boerhavia gardneri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
