                    <h1>Blastus pulverulentus</h1>
<p>Blastus pulverulentus, commonly known as the dusty bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may emerge from the water's surface. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
