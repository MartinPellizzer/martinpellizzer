                    <h1>Biophytum fruticosum</h1>
<p>Biophytum fruticosum, commonly known as the sticky false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forest understories.</p>
<p>The sticky hairs on its leaves and stems serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
