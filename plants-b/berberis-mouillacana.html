                    <h1>Berberis mouillacana</h1>
<p>Berberis mouillacana, commonly known as the Mouillacana barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a sharp, astringent taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in temperate climates.</p>
