<p>Buglossites, commonly known as blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Buglossites species typically have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. They are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants in gardens.</p>
