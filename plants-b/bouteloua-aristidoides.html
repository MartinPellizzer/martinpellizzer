                    <h1>Bouteloua aristidoides</h1>
<p>Bouteloua aristidoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage.</p>
<p>It is a perennial bunchgrass that thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soils.</p>
<p>Blue grama is an important component of many grassland ecosystems due to its drought tolerance and ecological value.</p>
