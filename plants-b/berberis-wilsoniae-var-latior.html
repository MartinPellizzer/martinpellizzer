                    <h1>Berberis wilsoniae var. latior</h1>
<p>Berberis wilsoniae var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems and compound leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest, though it may be invasive in certain regions.</p>
