<p>Betula alba var. torfacea, commonly known as the white birch with a distinctive bark pattern.</p>
<p>This variant of the white birch is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, often revealing a contrasting yellowish or reddish inner bark. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight.
