<p>Bulbophyllum tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive pattern of markings. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions.</p>
