                    <h1>Berberis melanocarpa</h1>
<p>Berberis melanocarpa, commonly known as the Indian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of bright orange-red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is part of the Berberidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant foliage and berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but are typically used in jams and pies, though they are more popular for their ornamental appeal than their culinary use.</p>
