<p>Bulbophyllum pterodon, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, wing-like structures on its pseudobulbs, which are adaptations for water storage in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
