                    <h1>Breynia calcarea</h1>
<p>Breynia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone shrub, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Breynia calcarea is adapted to grow in poor, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its stems makes it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
