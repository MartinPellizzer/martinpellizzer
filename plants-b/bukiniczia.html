                    <h1>Bukiniczia</h1>
<p>Bukiniczia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features basal leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, resembling those of the dandelion, and appear in spring.</p>
<p>Bukiniczia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
