                    <h1>Betula pendula</h1>
<p>Betula pendula, commonly known as weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are small and clustered. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn golden yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Betula pendula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks.</p>
