<p>Berberis micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
