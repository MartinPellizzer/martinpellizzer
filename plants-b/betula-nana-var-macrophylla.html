                    <h1>Betula nana var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Betula nana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are broader than those of the typical Betula nana, often reaching up to 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale, sometimes peeling in thin layers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>Betula nana var. macrophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides habitat for various arctic and alpine wildlife.</p>
