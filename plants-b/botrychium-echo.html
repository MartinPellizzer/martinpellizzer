<p>Botrychium echo, commonly known as the echo fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique fronds that are divided into two distinct parts: a fertile lower portion and a sterile upper portion. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, cup-like formation on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium echo is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
