<p>Botrychium obliquum var. multifidum, commonly known as the multifid mouse-ear, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium obliquum var. multifidum is a rare and ancient plant species, with a unique reproductive structure that reflects its evolutionary history.</p>
