                    <h1>Bogoria robertsii</h1>
<p>Bogoria robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts' bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude wetlands of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the short rainy season. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often in bogs or marshes where it forms dense colonies. Its survival depends on specific hydrological conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Bogoria robertsii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
