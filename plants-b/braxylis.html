                    <h1>Braxylis</h1>
<p>Braxylis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the arid regions of Central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, bell-shaped flowers that appear to glow in the moonlight, a trait that has earned it its mystical common name. The plant's leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Braxylis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or sand dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
