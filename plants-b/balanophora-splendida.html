                    <h1>Balanophora splendida</h1>
<p>Balanophora splendida, commonly known as the splendid orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
