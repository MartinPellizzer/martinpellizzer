                    <h1>Bassia laurifolia var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Bassia laurifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in container gardens.</p>
