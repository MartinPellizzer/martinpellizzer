                    <h1>Balanophora affinis</h1>
<p>Balanophora affinis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found growing on the trunks of longleaf pines in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
