                    <h1>Bowdichia brasiliensis var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Bowdichia brasiliensis var. coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Its dense, hard wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making due to its durability and resistance to decay.</p>
<p>The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
