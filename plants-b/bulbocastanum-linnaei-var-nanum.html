The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, dry climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
