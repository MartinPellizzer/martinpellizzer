<p>Bancroftia xanthorrhiza, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a unique plant species native to the coastal regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and waterlogged environments. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
