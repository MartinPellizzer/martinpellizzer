                    <h1>Brathydium fulgidum</h1>
<p>Brathydium fulgidum, commonly known as the golden cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive, cup-like shape. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on decaying wood or bark in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique color and structure, it is a notable species in ecological studies and lichenology.</p>
