                    <h1>Barbarea rupicola</h1>
<p>Barbarea rupicola, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is adapted to poor, well-drained soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Barbarea rupicola is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
