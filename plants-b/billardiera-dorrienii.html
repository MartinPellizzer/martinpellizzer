<p>Billardiera dorrienii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees, forming dense clusters that can cover large areas of the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Billardiera dorrienii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
