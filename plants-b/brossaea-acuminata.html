<p>Brossaea acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated brossaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring.
