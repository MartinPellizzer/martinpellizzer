<p>Baccharis resinosa var. truncatifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in dry, open areas such as plains, prairies, and disturbed soils. It has a woody stem and produces small, resinous berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
