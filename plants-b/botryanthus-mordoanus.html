                    <h1>Botryanthus mordoanus</h1>
<p>Botryanthus mordoanus, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to three meters in height, covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a candle-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Botryanthus mordoanus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
