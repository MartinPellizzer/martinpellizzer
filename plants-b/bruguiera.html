                    <h1>Bruguiera</h1>
<p>Bruguiera, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments, making them essential components of mangrove ecosystems. Bruguiera species typically have specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. They also possess salt-excreting leaves, which help them survive in high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>These trees play a crucial role in coastal protection, biodiversity support, and carbon sequestration.</p>
