                    <h1>Bartsiella rameauana</h1>
<p>Bartsiella rameauana, commonly known as the Rameau's barbed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a granular texture and distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on bark and stone surfaces. It is typically found in humid, temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
