                    <h1>Blechnum rigidum</h1>
<p>Blechnum rigidum, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a perennial fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant grows in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops and dry forests, and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Blechnum rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>
