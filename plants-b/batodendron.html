<p>Batodendron, commonly known as the moonflower tree, is a unique plant characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
<p>Its flowers open only at night, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that attracts pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>The batodendron is native to tropical regions and is often found in dense, humid forests.</p>
