<p>Brachycorythis engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's short-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like male and female inflorescences, which are essential for its unique pollination process.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Brachycorythis engleriana is listed as critically endangered, making conservation efforts vital for its survival.</p>
