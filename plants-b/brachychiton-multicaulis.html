<p>Brachychiton multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its multiple trunks and broad, palm-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, pale green coating. The plant produces large, showy red or orange flowers in clusters during the wet season, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Brachychiton multicaulis is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
