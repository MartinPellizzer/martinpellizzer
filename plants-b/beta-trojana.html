                    <h1>Beta trojana</h1>
<p>Beta trojana, commonly known as the Trojan beetroot, is a lesser-known variant of the Beta vulgaris species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep purple roots and leafy greens, which are rich in nutrients such as betalains and antioxidants. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is typically cultivated for both its edible roots and leaves, which can be used in various culinary applications.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, Beta trojana is not as widely cultivated as other beetroot varieties.</p>
