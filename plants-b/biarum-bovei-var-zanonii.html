                    <h1>Biarum bovei var. zanonii</h1>
<p>Biarum bovei var. zanonii, commonly known as the Zanonii bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive purple or violet throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
