                    <h1>Bulbophyllum vestigipetalum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum vestigipetalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and thin, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pale yellow flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
