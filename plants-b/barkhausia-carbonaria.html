                    <h1>Barkhausia carbonaria</h1>
<p>Barkhausia carbonaria, commonly known as the black bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, upper surface and a lighter, often greyish, lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between algae and fungi, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, especially in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and ecological health in its habitat.</p>
