                    <h1>Bromelia communis</h1>
<p>Bromelia communis, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a colorful bract, which becomes the familiar pineapple fruit after fertilization. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Bromelia communis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruit.</p>
