<p>Buxus holttumiana, commonly known as the Holttum boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Buxus holttumiana is well-suited for use in formal gardens and as a topiary due to its slow growth and ability to maintain shape.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
