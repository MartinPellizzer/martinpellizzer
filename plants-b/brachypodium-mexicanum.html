                    <h1>Brachypodium mexicanum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which produce small, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Brachypodium mexicanum is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological resilience and potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
