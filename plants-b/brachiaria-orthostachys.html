                    <h1>Brachiaria orthostachys</h1>
<p>Brachiaria orthostachys, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is widely used in pastures and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is well adapted to warm, moist environments.</p>
