                    <h1>Bosleria</h1>
<p>Bosleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and delicate, pale flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Bosleria species are known for their ephemeral blooming period, which typically occurs during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, many Bosleria species are considered endangered and are protected in conservation programs.</p>
