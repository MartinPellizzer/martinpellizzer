The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
