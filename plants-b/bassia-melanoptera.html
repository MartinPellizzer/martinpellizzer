                    <h1>Bassia melanoptera</h1>
<p>Bassia melanoptera, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Bassia melanoptera is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
