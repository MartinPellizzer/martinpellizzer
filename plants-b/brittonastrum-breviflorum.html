<p>Brittonastrum breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered Brittonastrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
