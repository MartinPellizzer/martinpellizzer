                    <h1>Bicornella kassneeriana</h1>
<p>Bicornella kassneeriana, commonly known as the Kassneer's bicorn, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bi-lobed, umbrella-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions of South Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
