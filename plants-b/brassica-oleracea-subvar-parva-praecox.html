                    <h1>Brassica oleracea subvar. parva-praecox</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea subvar. parva-praecox, commonly known as the wild cabbage or early cabbage, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and small, cabbage-like heads that form in the second year. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is a hardy species that can tolerate cooler temperatures and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is considered an ancestor of several cultivated brassicas, including cabbage and kale.</p>
