                    <h1>Bulbophyllum ecuadorense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
