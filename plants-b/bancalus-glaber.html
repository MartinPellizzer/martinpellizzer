<p>Bancalus glaber, commonly known as the hairy water beetle, is a species of aquatic beetle belonging to the family Dytiscidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, oval body covered in fine, hairy setae, which give it a distinctive appearance. This beetle is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its larvae, known as water beetles, are also aquatic and play a role in the ecosystem by feeding on algae and small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its larvae, with a segmented body and a siphon, has led to its common name.</p>
