                    <h1>Brachycorythis goetziana</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis goetziana, commonly known as the Goetz's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
