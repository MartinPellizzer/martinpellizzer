                    <h1>Betula bhojpattra var. jacquemontii</h1>
<p>Betula bhojpattra var. jacquemontii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a variant of the birch tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored wood beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
