<p>Botrychium matricariifolium subsp.</p>
<p>patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, helmet-like shape at the tip of the frond. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
