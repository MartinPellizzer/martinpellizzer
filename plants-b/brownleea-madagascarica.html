<p>Brownleea madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and elongated, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include a short, slender stem and small, clustered flowers that bloom in a single season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
