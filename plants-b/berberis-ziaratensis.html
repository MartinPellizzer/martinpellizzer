<p>Berberis ziaratensis, commonly known as the Ziarat barberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
