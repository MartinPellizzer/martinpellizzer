                    <h1>Bahia ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Bahia ehrenbergii, commonly known as desert carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Bahia ehrenbergii is well adapted to drought, making it a valuable plant for landscaping in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
