                    <h1>Betula pubescens var. rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive warty, corky bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are rhomboid in shape, hence the specific epithet *rhombifolia*, and are typically arranged alternately along the branches. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and its role in ecological succession in forested areas.</p>
