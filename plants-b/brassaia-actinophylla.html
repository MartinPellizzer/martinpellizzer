<p>Brassaia actinophylla, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that resemble a fern, with a silvery-white underside that reflects light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. Brassaia actinophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor plant collections.</p>
