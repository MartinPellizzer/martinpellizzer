                    <h1>Bergenia cordifolia</h1>
<p>Bergenia cordifolia, commonly known as false sorrel, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and basal leaves that are heart-shaped, hence its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent foliage helps it survive in harsh, cold climates by storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Bergenia cordifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
