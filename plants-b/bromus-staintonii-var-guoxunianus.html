                    <h1>Bromus staintonii var. guoxunianus</h1>
<p>Bromus staintonii var. guoxunianus, commonly known as the Guoxunianus brome, is a perennial grass species native to China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting adaptations to dry environments such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, with lemmas that are hairy and pointed. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
