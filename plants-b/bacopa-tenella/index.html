<p>Bacopa tenella is a small, creeping plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are small, blue or purple, and bloom in clusters. Despite its modest appearance, Bacopa tenella holds significance in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
