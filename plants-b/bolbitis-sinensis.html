<p>Bolbitis sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to submerged substrates. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis sinensis is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams.</p>
