<p>Brachystelma gymnopodum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Brachystelma gymnopodum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
