<p>Bromus asper var. hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with bracts that are hairy and sometimes longer than the florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
