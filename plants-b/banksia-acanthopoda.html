<p>Banksia acanthopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Banksia acanthopoda is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that release seeds after a bushfire.</p>
