                    <h1>Baccharis psammophila</h1>
<p>Baccharis psammophila, commonly known as sand baccharis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators. It is often found in desert scrub and coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed soils and its value to local wildlife.</p>
