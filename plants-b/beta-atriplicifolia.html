<p>Beta atriplicifolia, commonly known as sea beet, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are rich in betaine, a compound that helps it tolerate saline and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Sea beet is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines.</p>
