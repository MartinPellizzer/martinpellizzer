<p>Botrychium ternatum f. robustum, commonly known as the robust fern brake, is a variant of the fern brake species.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, upright stipe and a broad, pinnate lamina. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
