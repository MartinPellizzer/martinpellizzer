<p>Bombax blancoanum, commonly known as the white silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in the early morning. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its fiber, though it is not as economically significant as other Bombax species.</p>
