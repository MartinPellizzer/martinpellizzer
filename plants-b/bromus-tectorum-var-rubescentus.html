                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. rubescentus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. rubescentus, commonly known as the red-stemmed cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is highly invasive in arid and semi-arid regions. It plays a significant role in shaping ecosystems due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
