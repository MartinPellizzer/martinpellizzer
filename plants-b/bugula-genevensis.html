                    <h1>Bugula genevensis</h1>
<p>Bugula genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva seaapple, is a species of marine bryozoan found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense colonies that resemble small, rounded bushes, often attached to rocky substrates. The colonies are composed of numerous tiny, calcareous zooids that are interconnected by a network of channels. Each zooid has a lophophore, a crown of ciliated tentacles used for filter feeding.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of intertidal zones.</p>
