<p>Blechnum fluviatile, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
