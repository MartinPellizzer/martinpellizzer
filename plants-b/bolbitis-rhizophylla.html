<p>Bolbitis rhizophylla, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
