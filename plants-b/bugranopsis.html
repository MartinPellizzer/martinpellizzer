                    <h1>Bugranopsis</h1>
<p>Bugranopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like structure and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphytic species. Bugranopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
