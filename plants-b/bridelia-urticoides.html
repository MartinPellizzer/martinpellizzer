<p>Bridelia urticoides, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, similar to those found in true nettles. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered with a fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and the fruit is a capsule containing minute seeds.</p>
<p>Bridelia urticoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
