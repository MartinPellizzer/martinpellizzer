                    <h1>Begonia geranioides</h1>
<p>Begonia geranioides, commonly known as the ivy-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble those of geraniums, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats of foliage.</p>
