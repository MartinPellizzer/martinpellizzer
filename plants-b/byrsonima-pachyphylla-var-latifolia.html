<p>Byrsonima pachyphylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wax apple, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit contains a single, large seed enclosed in a fleshy, edible pulp.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and dry forests.</p>
