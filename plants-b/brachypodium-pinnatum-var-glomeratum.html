                    <h1>Brachypodium pinnatum var. glomeratum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pinnatum var. glomeratum, commonly known as clustered false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
