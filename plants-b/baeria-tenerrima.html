                    <h1>Baeria tenerrima</h1>
<p>Baeria tenerrima, commonly known as the dwarf lichen or the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the surfaces it colonizes. The thallus is typically pale yellow to greenish in color, with a powdery coating that helps in moisture retention. It is often found on granite and limestone substrates, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for environmental conditions, particularly in areas with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
