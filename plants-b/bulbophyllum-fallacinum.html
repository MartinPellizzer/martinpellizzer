                    <h1>Bulbophyllum fallacinum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum fallacinum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique botanical feature is its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly forms, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
