<p>Borzicactus haynii var. hystrix, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
