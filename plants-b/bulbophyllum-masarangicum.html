                    <h1>Bulbophyllum masarangicum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum masarangicum, commonly known as the Borneo ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly figures. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its natural humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
