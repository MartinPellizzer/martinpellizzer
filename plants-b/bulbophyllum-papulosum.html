The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its natural habitat in the canopy of tropical forests.</p>
<p>This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
