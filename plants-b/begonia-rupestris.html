                    <h1>Begonia rupestris</h1>
<p>Begonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
