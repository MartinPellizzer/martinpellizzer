                    <h1>Brasiliopuntia bahiensis</h1>
<p>Brasiliopuntia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Brasiliopuntia bahiensis is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range.</p>
