                    <h1>Betula alba lusus parvifolia</h1>
<p>Betula alba lusus parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a rare variant of the white birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical white birch. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a cupule, which are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, similar to other birch species, but it tends to develop fissures as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
