                    <h1>Bartlettina oresbioides</h1>
<p>Bartlettina oresbioides, commonly known as the Oresbioides mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and hickories. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in forest ecosystem dynamics.</p>
