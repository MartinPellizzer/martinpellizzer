                    <h1>Betula pendula f. viscosa</h1>
<p>Betula pendula f. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a variant of the silver birch characterized by its glandular hairs on the young shoots and leaves.</p>
<p>This feature gives the plant a distinctive sticky texture, which is more pronounced in its juvenile stages. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that thrives in temperate climates, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and white when young, becoming fissured and darker with age.</p>
