The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually leathery and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
