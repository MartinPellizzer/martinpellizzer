<p>Bruguiera timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that help the plant breathe in waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera timoriensis is also important for its ability to filter pollutants and support diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
