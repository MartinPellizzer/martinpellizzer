                    <h1>Betula × heptopotamica</h1>
<p>Betula × heptopotamica, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the crossbreeding of different birch species.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits characteristics of both parent species, often displaying white or silver bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is native to regions where its parent species naturally occur, such as parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring, followed by the development of small, winged seeds.</p>
