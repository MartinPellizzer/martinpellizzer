<p>Brahea calcarea, commonly known as the desert fan palm, is a species of palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of stiff, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits.</p>
<p>Brahea calcarea is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic.</p>
