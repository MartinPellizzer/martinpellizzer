                    <h1>Bulbophyllum purpurellum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum purpurellum, commonly known as the Purple-tinged Lady's Tongue, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive purple hue, often with a contrasting white or yellow base. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often-dry, exposed habitats.</p>
<p>It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
