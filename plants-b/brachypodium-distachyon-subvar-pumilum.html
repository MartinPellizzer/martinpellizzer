                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. pumilum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon subvar. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf brachypodium, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, sturdy stems and narrow leaves. This plant is widely used in plant biology research due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its small genome size and ease of cultivation further enhance its value as a model organism in grass genetics.</p>
