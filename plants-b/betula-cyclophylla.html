<p>Betula cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclocalyx birch, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Betulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted bark, which distinguishes it from other birch species. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring cool and humid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
