                    <h1>Bulbocastanum</h1>
<p>Bulbocastanum, commonly known as the bulbous chestnut, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structure that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiky husk. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bulbocastanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
