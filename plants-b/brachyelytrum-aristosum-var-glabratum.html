<p>Brachyelytrum aristosum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth fringed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
