<p>Bromus ornans, commonly known as the ornate brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus ornans thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
