                    <h1>Beaucarnea petenensis</h1>
<p>Beaucarnea petenensis, commonly known as the "pupu" or "tree of life," is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Beaucarnea petenensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
