                    <h1>Bixa orellana</h1>
<p>Bixa orellana, commonly known as the annatto tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often thornless bark and oval, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. The seeds are encased in a reddish-orange aril, which is the primary source of the plant's characteristic orange dye.</p>
<p>Bixa orellana is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
