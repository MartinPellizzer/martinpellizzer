<p>Bryonia scarlatina, commonly known as the red bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its prickly stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to orange, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical features include a strong, woody vine with tendrils that help it climb, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
