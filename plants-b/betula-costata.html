                    <h1>Betula costata</h1>
<p>Betula costata, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of Asia and the Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often white- or silver-colored bark and slender, branching form. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula costata is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
