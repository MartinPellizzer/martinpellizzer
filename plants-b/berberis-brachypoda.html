<p>Berberis brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in small, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are small, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Berberis brachypoda is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
