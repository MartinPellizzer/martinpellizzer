                    <h1>Blastocaulon prostratum</h1>
<p>Blastocaulon prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Blastocaulon prostratum is often found in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is an important part of the aquatic ecosystem.</p>
