<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
