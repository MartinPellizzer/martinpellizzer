                    <h1>Botrychium lunaria var. boreale</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunaria var. boreale, commonly known as the northern moonwort, is a rare fern species native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that resemble a moon, hence its common name. The plant has a unique life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which it depends on for nutrient uptake. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, cup-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
