                    <h1>Botrychium multifidum var. oneidense</h1>
<p>Botrychium multifidum var. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a unique, knob-like structure called a sorus, which is positioned near the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is relatively rare and is found primarily in the northeastern United States, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
