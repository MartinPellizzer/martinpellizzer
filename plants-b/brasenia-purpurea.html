                    <h1>Brasenia purpurea</h1>
<p>Brasenia purpurea, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-lily native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water, often at night. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Brasenia purpurea is adapted to slow-moving or still water bodies, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes.</p>
