                    <h1>Billbergia fastuosa</h1>
<p>Billbergia fastuosa, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pink or red flowers that bloom for several weeks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
