                    <h1>Burragea fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Burragea fruticulosa, commonly known as the white burragea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping and for erosion control.</p>
