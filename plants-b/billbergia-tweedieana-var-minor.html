<p>Billbergia tweedieana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on tall, branched inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
