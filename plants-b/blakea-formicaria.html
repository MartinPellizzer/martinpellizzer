                    <h1>Blakea formicaria</h1>
<p>Blakea formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemiepiphytic shrub native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to climb and anchor itself to tree trunks using specialized aerial roots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red or orange berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Blakea formicaria is notable for its symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
