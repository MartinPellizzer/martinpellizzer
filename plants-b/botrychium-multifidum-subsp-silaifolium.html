<p>Botrychium multifidum subsp.</p>
<p>silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is distinguished by its intricate, divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
