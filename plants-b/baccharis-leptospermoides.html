<p>Baccharis leptospermoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
