                    <h1>Bromelia exigua</h1>
<p>Bromelia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to hold water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries. Its adaptability to shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
