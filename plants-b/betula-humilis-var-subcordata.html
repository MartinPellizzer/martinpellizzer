                    <h1>Betula humilis var. subcordata</h1>
<p>Betula humilis var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrowly elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The bark is typically smooth and pale, with a subtle, peeling texture that reveals a lighter inner layer. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
