                    <h1>Banksia physodes</h1>
<p>Banksia physodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant produces large, woody cones that persist on the plant for several years, a feature typical of many banksia species. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Banksia physodes is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with its serotinous cones releasing seeds only after exposure to heat.</p>
