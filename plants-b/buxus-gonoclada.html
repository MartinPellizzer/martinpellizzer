<p>Buxus gonoclada, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Buxus gonoclada is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
