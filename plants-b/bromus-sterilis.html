                    <h1>Bromus sterilis</h1>
<p>Bromus sterilis, commonly known as the sterile brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of viable seeds, as the flowers are sterile, which limits its ability to reproduce sexually.</p>
<p>This trait makes it an important component in ecological studies related to plant reproduction and population dynamics.</p>
