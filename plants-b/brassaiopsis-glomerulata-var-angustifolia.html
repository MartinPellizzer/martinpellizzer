<p>Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bracken fern, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
