                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sundaicum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sundaicum, commonly known as the Sunda Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it typically grows on rocks or in crevices, relying on these substrates for support and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, colorful flowers with a distinctive lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding environment, making it well-suited to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
