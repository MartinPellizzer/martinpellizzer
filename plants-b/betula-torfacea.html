                <h1>Betula torfacea</h1>
<p>Betula torfacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and finely serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, with some species showing a flaky texture.</p>
<p>Betula torfacea is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
