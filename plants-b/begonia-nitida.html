                    <h1>Begonia nitida</h1>
<p>Begonia nitida, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Begonia nitida is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
