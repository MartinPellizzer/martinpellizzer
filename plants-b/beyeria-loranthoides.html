                    <h1>Beyeria loranthoides</h1>
<p>Beyeria loranthoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny white or yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Beyeria loranthoides plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
