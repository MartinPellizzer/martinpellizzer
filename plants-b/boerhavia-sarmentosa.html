                    <h1>Boerhavia sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Boerhavia sarmentosa, commonly known as red sandalwood or inch plant, is a sprawling herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often hairy, with a succulent texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Boerhavia sarmentosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
