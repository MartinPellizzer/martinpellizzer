                    <h1>Bracteocarpus expansus</h1>
<p>Bracteocarpus expansus, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it conserve water in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Bracteocarpus expansus is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
