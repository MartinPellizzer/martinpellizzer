<p>Botrychium yaaxudakeit, commonly known as the Yaaxudakeit moonwort, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a short, thick rhizome and a single, broad, lance-shaped frond. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its frond, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbel-like structure. Botrychium yaaxudakeit is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
