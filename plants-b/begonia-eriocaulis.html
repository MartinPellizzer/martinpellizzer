<p>Begonia eriocaulis, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
