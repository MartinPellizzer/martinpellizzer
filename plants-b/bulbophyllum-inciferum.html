                    <h1>Bulbophyllum inciferum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum inciferum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
