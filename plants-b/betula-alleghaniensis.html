                    <h1>Betula alleghaniensis</h1>
<p>Betula alleghaniensis, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The yellow birch is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important in ecological systems as a habitat provider.</p>
