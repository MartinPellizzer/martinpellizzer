                    <h1>Betula pubescens var. lucida</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens var. lucida, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath, and its slender, pendulous branches. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic.</p>
<p>The silver birch is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively hardy, making it a common sight in temperate regions.</p>
