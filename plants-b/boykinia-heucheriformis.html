                    <h1>Boykinia heucheriformis</h1>
<p>Boykinia heucheriformis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with a dense mat of silver-gray foliage that reflects light and helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Boykinia heucheriformis is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
