                    <h1>Bromelia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Bromelia epiphytica, commonly known as the Spanish moss bromeliad, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in rainforests. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves form a central pool that collects water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its vibrant, spathaceous flowers are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Bromelia epiphytica plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
