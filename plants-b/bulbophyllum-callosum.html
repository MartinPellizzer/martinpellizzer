                    <h1>Bulbophyllum callosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum callosum, commonly known as the Cinnabar Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, vivid red and orange flowers that resemble cinnabar, a mercury sulfide mineral. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer, making it a striking addition to botanical collections.</p>
