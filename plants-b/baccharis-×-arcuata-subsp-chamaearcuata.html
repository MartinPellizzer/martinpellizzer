<p>Baccharis × arcuata subsp.</p>
<p>chamaearcuata, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and silver-gray foliage, which reflects its adaptation to saline and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and ability to tolerate coastal conditions make it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>It is also used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
