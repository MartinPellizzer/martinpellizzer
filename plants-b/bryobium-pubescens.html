<p>Bryobium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive hairy appearance, with fine pubescence covering its surfaces, which helps in reducing water loss and enhancing photosynthesis. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Bryobium pubescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
