                    <h1>Betula celtiberica</h1>
<p>Betula celtiberica, commonly known as the Celtiberian birch, is a rare and ancient species of birch native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and smooth, white bark, which are typical features of the Betula genus. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as mountain forests. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various insects and fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Betula celtiberica is considered a conservation concern.</p>
