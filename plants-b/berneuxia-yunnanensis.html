                    <h1>Berneuxia yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Berneuxia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan berneuxia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellow-green flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in cultivation, though it remains challenging to grow outside its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Berneuxia yunnanensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
