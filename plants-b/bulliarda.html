<p>Bulliarda, commonly known as the sandbur, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Americas and are often found in arid or sandy environments. They are characterized by their spiny seed heads, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Bulliarda species typically have narrow, hairy leaves and produce yellow or white flowers.</p>
<p>They are often considered weeds but play a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
