                    <h1>Bicornella baronii</h1>
<p>Bicornella baronii, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its distinctive two-horned structure on its flower spikes, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bicornella baronii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
