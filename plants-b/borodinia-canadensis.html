<p>Borodinia canadensis, commonly known as Canada's false nettle, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Borodinia canadensis is not typically invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
