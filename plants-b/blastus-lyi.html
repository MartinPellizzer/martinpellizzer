                    <h1>Blastus lyi</h1>
<p>Blastus lyi, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Blastus lyi is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
