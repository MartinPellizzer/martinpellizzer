                            <h1>Bidens Triplinervia Var. Typica</h1>
<p>Triplinerved bidens, scientifically known as Bidens triplinervia var. typica, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States. This annual herb is part of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is recognized for its distinctive three-veined leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in moist soils and often grows along the edges of ponds, swamps, and ditches. Despite its common presence in natural habitats, it is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
