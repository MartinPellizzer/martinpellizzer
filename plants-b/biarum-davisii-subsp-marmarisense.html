<p>Biarum davisii subsp.</p>
<p>marmarisense, commonly known as the Marmaris bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of Turkey, specifically around the Marmara Sea, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found growing in open, sunny habitats near the coast.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
