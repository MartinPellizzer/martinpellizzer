                    <h1>Buddleja spectabilis</h1>
<p>Buddleja spectabilis, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. It is particularly valued in gardens for attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
