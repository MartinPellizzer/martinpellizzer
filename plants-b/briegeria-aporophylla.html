<p>Briegeria aporophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, feathery texture.</p>
<p>Briegeria aporophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
