<p>Botrychium obliquum f. oblongifolium is a unique fern species known for its distinctive leaf structure and ecological significance. This fern is a fern-like plant that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, commonly referred to as the adder's tongue family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that differ from the typical fern morphology. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its presence serves as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
