<p>Blotiella glabra, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves, a trait common among many carnivorous plants. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Blotiella glabra is also capable of producing small, bladder-like structures that can trap tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
