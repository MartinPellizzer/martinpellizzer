                    <h1>Betula chinensis var. linearisquama</h1>
<p>Betula chinensis var. linearisquama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a variant of the Chinese birch native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a pale or grayish color, which becomes more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
