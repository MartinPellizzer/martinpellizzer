                    <h1>Balantium glaucescens</h1>
<p>Balantium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a characteristic common among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Balantium glaucescens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun.</p>
