<p>Bernardia heteropilosa, commonly known as the purple-flowered bernardia, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardia heteropilosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
