                    <h1>Bulbophyllum chelicerum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum chelicerum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic epiphyte, meaning it grows on rocks or trees, often in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spiders, hence its common name. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
