                    <h1>Bidens spathulata</h1>
<p>Bidens spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
