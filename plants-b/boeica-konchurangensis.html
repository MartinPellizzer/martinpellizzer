<p>Boeica konchurangensis, commonly known as the Konchurang mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
