<p>Botrychium silesiacum, commonly known as the Silesian moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
