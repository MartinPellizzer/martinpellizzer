<p>Begonia lobbiana, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, making it well adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Begonia lobbiana is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
