                    <h1>Bolbitis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Bolbitis species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, with Bolbitis heterophylla being the most well-known for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
