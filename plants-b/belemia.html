                    <h1>Belemia</h1>
<p>Belemia, commonly known as the "ghost tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their slender, often twisted stems and small, clustered leaves. Belemia species produce distinctive flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or white, and their fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>These plants are typically slow-growing and have a unique, almost ethereal appearance, contributing to their common name.</p>
