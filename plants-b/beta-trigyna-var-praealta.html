<p>Beta trigyna var. praealta, commonly known as the purple carrot, is a cultivated variety of the wild carrot species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant purple pigmentation, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, feathery leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>The root, which is the primary edible part, is usually harvested when it reaches maturity, often in the fall.</p>
