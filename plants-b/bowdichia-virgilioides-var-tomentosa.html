                    <h1>Bowdichia virgilioides var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Bowdichia virgilioides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its hairy or tomentose surfaces, particularly on young growth, give it its common name.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
