<p>Bridgesia spicata, commonly known as the spiny bridgesia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments within lowland forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Bridgesia spicata is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
