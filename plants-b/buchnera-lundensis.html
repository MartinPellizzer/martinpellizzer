                    <h1>Buchnera lundensis</h1>
<p>Buchnera lundensis, commonly known as the Swedish lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered with a powdery or granular layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. Buchnera lundensis is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
