                    <h1>Bougainvillea peruviana</h1>
<p>Bougainvillea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian paper flower, is a vibrant, flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are less conspicuous than the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bougainvillea peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to grow on trellises or as a shrub.</p>
