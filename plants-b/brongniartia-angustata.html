<p>Brongniartia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
