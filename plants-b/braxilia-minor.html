                    <h1>Braxilia minor</h1>
<p>Braxilia minor, commonly known as the dwarf braxilia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Braxilia minor is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and can survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
