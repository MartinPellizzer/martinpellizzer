                    <h1>Balanophora distans</h1>
<p>Balanophora distans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for sustenance, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
