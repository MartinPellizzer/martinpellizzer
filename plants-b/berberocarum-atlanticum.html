                    <h1>Berberocarum atlanticum</h1>
<p>Berberocarum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic goldleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy soils through specialized root systems and waxy leaf coatings. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, allowing for efficient light capture.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes.</p>
