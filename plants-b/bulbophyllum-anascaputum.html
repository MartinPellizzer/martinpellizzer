                    <h1>Bulbophyllum anascaputum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum anascaputum, commonly known as the Cape York orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and a single, slender stem that supports a few elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive greenish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
