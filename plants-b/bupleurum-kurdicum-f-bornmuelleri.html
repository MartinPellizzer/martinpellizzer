                    <h1>Bupleurum kurdicum f. bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Bupleurum kurdicum f. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Kurdish cicely, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the Bupleurum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists studying the diversity within the Bupleurum species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
