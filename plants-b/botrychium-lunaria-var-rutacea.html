<p>Botrychium lunaria var. rutacea, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sorus. This variety is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant's spores are released from the sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium lunaria var. rutacea is a rare and delicate species, often requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
