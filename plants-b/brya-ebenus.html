                    <h1>Brya ebenus</h1>
<p>Brya ebenus, commonly known as the rock moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, greenish-yellow foliage and is often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Brya ebenus is typically found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of acidic, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in studies of bryophyte ecology.</p>
