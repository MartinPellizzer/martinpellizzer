<p>Bucinellina, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of small to medium-sized gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Bucinellinidae.</p>
<p>These organisms are typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. They possess a spiral shell that is often smooth or slightly ribbed, with a pointed or truncate aperture. Bucinellina species are primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other microscopic organisms.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems and serving as prey for various marine predators.</p>
