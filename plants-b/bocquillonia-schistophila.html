                    <h1>Bocquillonia schistophila</h1>
<p>Bocquillonia schistophila, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Bocquillonia schistophila is often found in rocky outcrops and is a common sight in the Succulent Karoo biome.</p>
