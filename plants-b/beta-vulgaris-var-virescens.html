                    <h1>Beta vulgaris var. virescens</h1>
<p>Beta vulgaris var. virescens, commonly known as the leaf beet or莙菜, is a cultivated variant of the beet plant characterized by its leafy foliage rather than its root.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and has been historically grown for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often used in salads or cooked dishes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a short, thickened stem and a rosette-like growth pattern, making it well-suited for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
