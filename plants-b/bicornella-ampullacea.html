                    <h1>Bicornella ampullacea</h1>
<p>Bicornella ampullacea, commonly known as the two-horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged, and it uses specialized bladder cells to capture tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Bicornella ampullacea is notable for its unique morphology and its adaptation to nutrient-deficient habitats.</p>
