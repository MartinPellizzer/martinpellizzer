                    <h1>Bryonia dioica var. corsica</h1>
<p>Bryonia dioica var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican bryony, is a variant of the bryony vine native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a climbing plant with distinctive tendrils and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and has historical uses in traditional medicine, though it is generally avoided due to its poisonous properties.</p>
