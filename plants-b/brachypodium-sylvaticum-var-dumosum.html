<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. dumosum, commonly known as the tufted false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
