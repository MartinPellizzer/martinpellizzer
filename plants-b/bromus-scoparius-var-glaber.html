                    <h1>Bromus scoparius var. glaber</h1>
<p>Bromus scoparius var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairless or very softly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
