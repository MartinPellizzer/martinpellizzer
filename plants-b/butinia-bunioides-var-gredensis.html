<p>Butinia bunioides var. gredensis, commonly known as the Gredens rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to specific regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are pale yellow to white, appearing in early spring, and the plant is notable for its ecological importance to local pollinators.</p>
