                    <h1>Buceras torosa</h1>
<p>Buceras torosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
