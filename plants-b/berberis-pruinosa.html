                    <h1>Berberis pruinosa</h1>
<p>Berberis pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Berberis pruinosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
