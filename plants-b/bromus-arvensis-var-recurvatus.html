                    <h1>Bromus arvensis var. recurvatus</h1>
<p>Bromus arvensis var. recurvatus, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
