                    <h1>Brucea erythraeae</h1>
<p>Brucea erythraeae, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Brucea erythraeae is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
