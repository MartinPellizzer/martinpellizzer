<p>Bulbophyllum nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent lip structures typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
