                    <h1>Balanophora mutinoides</h1>
<p>Balanophora mutinoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wet, swampy environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
