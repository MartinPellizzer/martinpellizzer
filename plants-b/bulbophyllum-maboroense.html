                    <h1>Bulbophyllum maboroense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum maboroense, commonly known as the Maboro ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly dependent on its host tree for support. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
