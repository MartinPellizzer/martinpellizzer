                    <h1>Buchnera garuensis</h1>
<p>Buchnera garuensis, commonly known as the Guaru√© grass, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Buchnera garuensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
