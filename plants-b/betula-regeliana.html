                    <h1>Betula regeliana</h1>
<p>Betula regeliana, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and papery, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience.</p>
