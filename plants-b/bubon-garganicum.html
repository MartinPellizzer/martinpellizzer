                    <h1>Bubon garganicum</h1>
<p>Bubon garganicum, commonly known as the sorrowful thorn, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Bubon garganicum lies in its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
