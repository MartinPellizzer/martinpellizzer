<p>Beta procumbens, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate lawns and gardens. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and basil.</p>
