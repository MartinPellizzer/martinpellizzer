                    <h1>Bermudiana avenacea</h1>
<p>Bermudiana avenacea, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and rhizomatous root system, it is often difficult to control once established.</p>
