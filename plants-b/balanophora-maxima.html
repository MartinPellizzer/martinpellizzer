                    <h1>Balanophora maxima</h1>
<p>Balanophora maxima, commonly known as the giant root orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, fleshy roots and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It produces showy, often fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat requirements, Balanophora maxima is considered rare and is often found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
