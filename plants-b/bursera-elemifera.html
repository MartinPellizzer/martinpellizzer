                    <h1>Bursera elemifera</h1>
<p>Bursera elemifera, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritual purposes.</p>
