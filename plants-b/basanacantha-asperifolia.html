                    <h1>Basanacantha asperifolia</h1>
<p>Basanacantha asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved basanacantha, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep underground.</p>
<p>Basanacantha asperifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
