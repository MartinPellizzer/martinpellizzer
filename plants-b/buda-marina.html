                    <h1>Buda marina</h1>
<p>Buda marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-white leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and salt marshes. Buda marina has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its marine habitat, though it is not actually a true holly.</p>
