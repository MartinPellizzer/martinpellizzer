                    <h1>Bulbophyllum oxyanthum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum oxyanthum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum oxyanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display.</p>
