                    <h1>Betula lenta var. lutea</h1>
<p>Betula lenta var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release winged seeds. Its wood is strong and durable, historically used for furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>The yellow birch is also valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in forest landscapes.</p>
