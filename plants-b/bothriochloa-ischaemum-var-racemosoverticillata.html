<p>Bothriochloa ischaemum var. racemosoverticillata, commonly known as the racemose overwedge grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces inflorescences that are both racemose and verticillate, meaning they have both elongated clusters and whorled arrangements of spikelets.
