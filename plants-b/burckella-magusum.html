                    <h1>Burckella magusum</h1>
<p>Burckella magusum, commonly known as the sacred flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red and yellow floral structures, which resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces intricate, spurred flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific lepidopteran species. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Burckella magusum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
