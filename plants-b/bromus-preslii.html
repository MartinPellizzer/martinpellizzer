<p>Bromus preslii, commonly known as Presli's brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus preslii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
