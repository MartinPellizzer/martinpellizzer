                    <h1>Betula fargesii</h1>
<p>Betula fargesii, commonly known as the Farges birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval in shape, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula fargesii is often found in subalpine and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
