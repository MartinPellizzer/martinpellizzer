<p>Bryobium pullum, commonly known as the moss fern, is a unique plant belonging to the order Ptylodiscales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of ferns, despite being a moss. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Bryobium pullum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
