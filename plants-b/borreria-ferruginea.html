                    <h1>Borreria ferruginea</h1>
<p>Borreria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and it has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria ferruginea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a common sight in desert landscapes and a subject of interest for botanists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
