                    <h1>Batrachium trichophyllum var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Batrachium trichophyllum var. caespitosus, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved fern characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in woodland habitats.</p>
