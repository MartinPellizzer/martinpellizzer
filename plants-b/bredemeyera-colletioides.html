<p>Bredemeyera colletioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in shaded, moist environments within forested areas. The plant has a unique appearance, characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
