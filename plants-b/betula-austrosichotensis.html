                    <h1>Betula austrosichotensis</h1>
<p>Betula austrosichotensis, commonly known as the southern Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves. The tree typically grows in taiga regions, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in reforestation projects in arctic and subarctic environments.</p>
