                    <h1>Bowdichia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Bowdichia ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The tree has compound leaves that are usually alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>
