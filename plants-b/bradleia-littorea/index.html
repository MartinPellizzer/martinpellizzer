                            <h1>Bradleia Littorea</h1>
<p>Bradleia littorea is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found near the edges of dunes or on rocky outcrops. The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its scientific name honors the botanist Henry Bradleia, who made significant contributions to plant taxonomy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bradleia littorea is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
