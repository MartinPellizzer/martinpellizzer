                            <h1>Banksia Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Hairy banksia, scientifically known as Banksia hirsuta, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of south-western Australia. With its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy foliage, it stands out among the diverse flora of its native habitat. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants. The hairy banksia plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds.</p>
