                    <h1>Broughtonia violacea</h1>
<p>Broughtonia violacea, commonly known as the violet starflower, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps collect and retain moisture.</p>
<p>Broughtonia violacea is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
