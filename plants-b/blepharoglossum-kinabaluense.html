                    <h1>Blepharoglossum kinabaluense</h1>
<p>Blepharoglossum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
