<p>Blechnopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Blechnopsis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
