                    <h1>Boehmeria hwaliensis</h1>
<p>Boehmeria hwaliensis, commonly known as Chinese hemp or wild hemp, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, fibrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
