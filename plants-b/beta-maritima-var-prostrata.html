<p>Beta maritima var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>Its prostrate growth habit helps it stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
