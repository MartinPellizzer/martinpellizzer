                    <h1>Bituminaria antiatlantica</h1>
<p>Bituminaria antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bituminaria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Bituminaria antiatlantica is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
