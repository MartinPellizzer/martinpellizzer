                    <h1>Bastardia bivalvis var. typica</h1>
<p>Bastardia bivalvis var. typica, commonly known as the coastal sand mustache, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Bastardia bivalvis var. typica is adapted to tolerate salt spray and extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
