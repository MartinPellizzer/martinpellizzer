                    <h1>Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, hence its subspecies name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is noted for its adaptability and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
