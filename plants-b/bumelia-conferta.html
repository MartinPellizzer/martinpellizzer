                <h1>Bumelia conferta</h1>
<p>Bumelia conferta, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Bumelia conferta plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
