<p>Blechnopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, triangular pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
