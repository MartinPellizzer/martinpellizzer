                    <h1>Bromus grossus var. subvillosus</h1>
<p>Bromus grossus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
