                    <h1>Brassicaria repanda</h1>
<p>Brassicaria repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved winter iceplant, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Brassicaria repanda is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar cruciform flowers.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to harsh climates make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
