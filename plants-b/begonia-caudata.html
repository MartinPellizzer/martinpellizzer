                    <h1>Begonia caudata</h1>
<p>Begonia caudata, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features trailing stems that produce clusters of small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
