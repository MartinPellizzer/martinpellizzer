                    <h1>Blaeria dumosa</h1>
<p>Blaeria dumosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Blaeria dumosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
