                    <h1>Banisteria suberosa</h1>
<p>Banisteria suberosa, commonly known as the red-twigged elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that turn a striking red color in the winter, providing seasonal visual interest. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>Banisteria suberosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive winter stems and seasonal blooms.</p>
