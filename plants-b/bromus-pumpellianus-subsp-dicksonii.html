<p>Bromus pumpellianus subsp.</p>
<p>dicksonii, commonly known as the Dickson's brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for genetic diversity.</p>
