                    <h1>Bassia scoparia var. trichophylla</h1>
<p>Bassia scoparia var. trichophylla, commonly known as silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale green leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and minimal water.</p>
