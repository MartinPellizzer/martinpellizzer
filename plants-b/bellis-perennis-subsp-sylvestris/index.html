<p>Bellis perennis subsp. sylvestris is a lesser-known variant of the common daisy known for its delicate white petals and yellow center. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the spring and early summer. Despite its beauty, it is not as widely cultivated as its more famous relatives. Its subtle charm makes it a favorite among botanists and garden enthusiasts alike.</p>
