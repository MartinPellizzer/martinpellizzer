                    <h1>Bigelowia viscidiflora</h1>
<p>Bigelowia viscidiflora, commonly known as the stickyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, waxy, and often hairy leaves that help retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, yellow-orange petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a distinctive botanical feature, likely serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Bigelowia viscidiflora is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and forest edges, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
