                    <h1>Baccharis cymosa</h1>
<p>Baccharis cymosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and compact growth habit also make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
