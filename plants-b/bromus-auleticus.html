<p>Bromus auleticus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it flowers from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Bromus auleticus is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
