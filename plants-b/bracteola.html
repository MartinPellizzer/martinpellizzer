                    <h1>Bracteola</h1>
<p>Bracteola, commonly known as a bract-like structure, is a specialized leaf-like appendage found in various flowering plants.</p>
<p>It typically develops at the base of a flower or inflorescence and serves to protect the developing floral parts. Bracteolas can vary in size, shape, and color, often resembling true leaves but lacking the typical venation patterns. They are commonly found in plants such as Euphorbia and some species of Asteraceae.</p>
<p>In some cases, bracteolas may also play a role in attracting pollinators or aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
