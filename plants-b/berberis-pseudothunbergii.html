<p>Berberis pseudothunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It has thorny stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often regulated in ecological settings.</p>
