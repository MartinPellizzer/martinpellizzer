                    <h1>Bellardiochloa aetnensis</h1>
<p>Bellardiochloa aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical and ecological study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
