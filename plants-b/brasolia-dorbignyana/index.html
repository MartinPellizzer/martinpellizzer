                            <h1>Brasolia Dorbignyana</h1>
<p>Dorbigny's brasilia, scientifically known as Brasolia dorbignyana, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. This unique species is characterized by its vibrant, showy blooms that display a blend of red, orange, and yellow hues. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Found primarily in the dense rainforests of Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the face of increasing environmental threats.</p>
