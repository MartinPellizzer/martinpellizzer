<p>Brachiaria fusiformis, commonly known as flatleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Brachiaria fusiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
