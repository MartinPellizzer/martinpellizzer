<p>Begonia mentewangensis, commonly known as the Mentewang begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Sumatra, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and the flowers bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Begonia mentewangensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
