                    <h1>Borreria paraguariensis f. puberula</h1>
<p>Borreria paraguariensis f. puberula, commonly known as the "Yareta" or "Peruvian tea," is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
