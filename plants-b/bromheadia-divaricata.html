                    <h1>Bromheadia divaricata</h1>
<p>Bromheadia divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromheadia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in coastal areas or near mangroves. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually small and clustered, are often overlooked but play a role in attracting pollinators.</p>
