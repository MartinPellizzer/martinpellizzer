                    <h1>Brassica oleracea f. salinaria</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea f. salinaria, commonly known as sea kale, is a botanical variant of the cabbage family characterized by its salt-tolerant properties.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in coastal areas where it thrives in saline soils and coastal climates. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sea kale produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often cultivated for its nutritional value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>The plant is an important example of natural adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
