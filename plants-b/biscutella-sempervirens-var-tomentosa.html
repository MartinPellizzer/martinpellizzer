                    <h1>Biscutella sempervirens var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Biscutella sempervirens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact growth habit. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
