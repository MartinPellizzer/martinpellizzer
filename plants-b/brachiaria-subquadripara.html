<p>Brachiaria subquadripara, commonly known as partridgegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, sometimes hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Brachiaria subquadripara is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage systems due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
