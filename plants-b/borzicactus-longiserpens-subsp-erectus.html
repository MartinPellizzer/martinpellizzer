<p>Borzicactus longiserpens subsp.</p>
<p>erectus, commonly known as the erect borzicactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
