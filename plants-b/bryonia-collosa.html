                    <h1>Bryonia collosa</h1>
<p>Bryonia collosa, commonly known as the rock bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, orange-colored fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with lobed margins, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
