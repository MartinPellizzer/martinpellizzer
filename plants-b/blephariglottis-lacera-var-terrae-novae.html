<p>Blephariglottis lacera var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a unique variant of the Blephariglottis lacera species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand, characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait in the plant kingdom, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
