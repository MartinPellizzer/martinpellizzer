<p>Begonia rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
