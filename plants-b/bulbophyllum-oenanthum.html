                    <h1>Bulbophyllum oenanthum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum oenanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and elongated, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
