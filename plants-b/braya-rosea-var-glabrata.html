                    <h1>Braya rosea var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Braya rosea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant features dense clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, setting it apart from other braya species.</p>
