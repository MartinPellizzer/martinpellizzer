                    <h1>Bonapartea glauca</h1>
<p>Bonapartea glauca, commonly known as the blue bonaparte, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue-violet petals and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonapartea glauca is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
