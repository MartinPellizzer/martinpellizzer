<p>Barringtonia obtusangula, commonly known as the broad-angled banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky substance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>The plant has a unique ability to form aerial roots, which help it grow into a sprawling canopy structure.</p>
