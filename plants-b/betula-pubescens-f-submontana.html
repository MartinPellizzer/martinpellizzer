                    <h1>Betula pubescens f. submontana</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens f. submontana, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a shrub or small tree native to the boreal and subarctic regions of Europe and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark, which peels in thin layers, and its small, triangular leaves that are often hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in open landscapes such as tundra and forest edges.</p>
<p>Betula pubescens f. submontana is an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
