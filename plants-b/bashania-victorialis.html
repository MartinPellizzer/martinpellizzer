<p>Bashania victorialis, commonly known as the Victor's bashania, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bashania victorialis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
