                    <h1>Bidens aristosa var. typica</h1>
<p>Bidens aristosa var. typica, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers with two lobes. The plant produces tiny, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in many regions, though it also serves as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
