                    <h1>Blechnum denticulatum</h1>
<p>Blechnum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed harts-tongue, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
