                    <h1>Begonia medeirosii</h1>
<p>Begonia medeirosii, commonly known as the Medeiros begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen among collectors and botanists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses.</p>
