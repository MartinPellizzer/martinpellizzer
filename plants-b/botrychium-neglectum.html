<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, slender rhizome with a pair of opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like formation on the underside of the fronds.
