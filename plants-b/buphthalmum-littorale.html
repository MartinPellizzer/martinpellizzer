<p>Buphthalmum littorale, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the coastline. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Buphthalmum littorale plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
