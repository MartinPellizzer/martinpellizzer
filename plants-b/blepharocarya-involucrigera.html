<p>Blepharocarya involucrigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems.</p>
