                    <h1>Bryophyllum serratum</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum serratum, commonly known as the mother of thousands, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in spring. Its unique feature is the ability to propagate through leaf-cuttings, where new plants develop from the notches on the leaf margins.</p>
<p>This makes it a popular choice for gardeners and a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
