                    <h1>Bromelia carnea</h1>
<p>Bromelia carnea, commonly known as the crimson bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces showy, tubular red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers, which bloom sequentially from the base upward. Its leaves are typically thick, waxy, and often have a reddish or bronze hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Bromelia carnea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
