                <h1>Benzoin myrrha</h1>
<p>Benzoin myrrha, commonly known as frankincense, is a resin derived from the Commiphora trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, balsamic scent and its rich, golden-brown color. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark of the tree, allowing the sap to exude and harden. It contains a complex mixture of terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other volatile compounds.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in religious ceremonies, traditional medicine, and as a fragrance in perfumery.</p>
