                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. typicus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. typicus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Bromus mollis var. typicus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control.</p>
