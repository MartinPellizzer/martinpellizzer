<p>Bassia patenticuspis, commonly known as the narrow-bristled sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Bassia patenticuspis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
