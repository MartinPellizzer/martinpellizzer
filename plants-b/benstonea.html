                    <h1>Benstonea</h1>
<p>Benstonea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Benstonea is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
