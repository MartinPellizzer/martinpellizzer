                    <h1>Buchnera granitica</h1>
<p>Buchnera granitica, commonly known as the granite fern, is a rare and resilient plant species adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact, low-growing form with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to desiccation. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb moisture from the environment. Buchnera granitica is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist microclimates.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme conditions, making it an important subject for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
