<p>Batrachium peltatum subsp.</p>
<p>truncatum, commonly known as the truncated pellucid fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, peltate fronds that are typically truncate at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually light green and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
