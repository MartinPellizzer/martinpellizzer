                    <h1>Betula nana f. reducta</h1>
<p>Betula nana f. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a shrub-like plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a compact form of the common dwarf birch, characterized by its low-growing habit and small, oval leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Betula nana f. reducta thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems.</p>
