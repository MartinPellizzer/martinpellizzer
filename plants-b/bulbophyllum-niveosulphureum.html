                    <h1>Bulbophyllum niveosulphureum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum niveosulphureum, commonly known as the White Sulphur Vase Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive sulfur-like scent, which attracts pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a sought-after species in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
