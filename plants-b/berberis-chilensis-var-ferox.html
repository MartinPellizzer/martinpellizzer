                    <h1>Berberis chilensis var. ferox</h1>
<p>Berberis chilensis var. ferox, commonly known as the Chilean barberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its spines can make handling it challenging.</p>
