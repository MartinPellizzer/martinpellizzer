<p>Bufonia ephedrina, commonly known as Chinese ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
