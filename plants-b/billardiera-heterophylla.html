                    <h1>Billardiera heterophylla</h1>
<p>Billardiera heterophylla, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its ability to derive some of its nutrients from host trees through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant exhibits considerable morphological variation, with leaves that can be simple or compound depending on the environment. It typically grows as a shrub or vine and produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can remain viable for extended periods, facilitating its spread.</p>
