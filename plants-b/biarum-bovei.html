<p>Biarum bovei, commonly known as the Bornean bellflower, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories. Biarum bovei is notable for its ornamental value and its role in local biodiversity, though it faces threats from habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability, it is protected under several conservation initiatives.</p>
