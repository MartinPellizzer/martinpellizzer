                    <h1>Bobua tanakae</h1>
<p>Bobua tanakae, commonly known as the Kauri orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the subtropical regions of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bobua tanakae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
