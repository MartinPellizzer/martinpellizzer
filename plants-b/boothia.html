                    <h1>Boothia</h1>
<p>Boothia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, often toxic, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. Boothia species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, they are often avoided by herbivores and can be challenging to cultivate in gardens.</p>
