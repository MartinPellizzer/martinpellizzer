                    <h1>Brachycorythis congoensis</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis congoensis, commonly known as the Congo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
