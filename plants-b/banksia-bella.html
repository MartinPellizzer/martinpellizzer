<p>Banksia bella, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, honeycomb-like flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody cones that remain on the plant for years, releasing seeds when dry. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Banksia bella is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological systems of its habitat.</p>
