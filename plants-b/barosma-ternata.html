<p>Barosma ternata, commonly known as the coastal barosma, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Barosma ternata is an important component of fynbos vegetation and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
