                    <h1>Biggina × conifera</h1>
<p>Biggina × conifera, commonly known as the hybrid mangrove, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Biggina alba and Bruguiera gymnorhiza.</p>
<p>It is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and tidal environments, often found in coastal areas. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a robust root system and salt-excreting leaves. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological adaptability and potential for restoration projects in degraded coastal ecosystems.</p>
