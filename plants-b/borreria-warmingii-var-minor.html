                    <h1>Borreria warmingii var. minor</h1>
<p>Borreria warmingii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf borreria, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and landscape designs in dry climates.</p>
