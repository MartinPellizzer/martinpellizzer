<p>Bucephalandra micrantha, commonly known as the "Java moss" or "water fern," is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded areas with soft, acidic water. Its rhizomes anchor it to substrates, while its floating leaves contribute to water filtration and habitat creation for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Bucephalandra micrantha is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
