                <h1>Bromus pubescens</h1>
<p>Bromus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with hairy leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Bromus pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
