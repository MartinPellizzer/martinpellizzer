                    <h1>Bunochilus prasinus</h1>
<p>Bunochilus prasinus, commonly known as the green leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces the formation of leaf galls on plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical impact is primarily observed through the abnormal growth of plant tissues, resulting in the formation of galls on leaves. These galls provide a protected environment for the larvae to develop. The plant species affected are typically members of the Asteraceae family, such as certain species of thistles and dandelions.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this insect helps in understanding plant-insect interactions and gall formation mechanisms.</p>
