                    <h1>Bondtia berryi</h1>
<p>Bondtia berryi, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer, adding a splash of color to the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bondtia berryi is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
