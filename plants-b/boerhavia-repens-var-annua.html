                    <h1>Boerhavia repens var. annua</h1>
<p>Boerhavia repens var. annua, commonly known as redroot sandplum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
