                    <h1>Buxus marginalis</h1>
<p>Buxus marginalis, commonly known as the margined boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish, margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Buxus marginalis is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into formal topiaries and its tolerance to pruning.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes.</p>
