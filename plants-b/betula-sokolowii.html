                    <h1>Betula sokolowii</h1>
<p>Betula sokolowii, commonly known as the Sokolow's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, serrated leaves that turn golden in autumn. Betula sokolowii is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in temperate gardens.</p>
