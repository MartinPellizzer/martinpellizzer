                    <h1>Brachypodium subtile</h1>
<p>Brachypodium subtile, commonly known as slender false brome, is a small, annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>Brachypodium subtile is valued in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and as a model species in plant genetics research.</p>
