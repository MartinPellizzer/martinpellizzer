<p>Beta trigynia, commonly known as the sea beet, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in salty, arid environments.

Beta trigynia is adapted to thrive in saline soils and can tolerate high levels of salt spray.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and hardy nature.</p>
