                    <h1>Bolbitis rivularis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis rivularis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Bolbitis rivularis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
