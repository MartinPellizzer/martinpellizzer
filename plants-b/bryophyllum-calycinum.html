                    <h1>Bryophyllum calycinum</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum calycinum, commonly known as the "Mother of Millions," is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters, which are followed by numerous offsets that can take root and grow independently. These offsets, often referred to as "pups," are a key feature of its reproductive strategy, enabling rapid propagation.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in dry conditions, making it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
