                    <h1>Bulbophyllum epicranthes var. epicranthes</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum epicranthes var. epicranthes, commonly known as the orchid with the distinctive white and green striped flowers, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically small and fragrant, blooming in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
