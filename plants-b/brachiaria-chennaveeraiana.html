<p>Brachiaria chennaveeraiana, commonly known as the African grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is well-adapted to dry conditions. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
