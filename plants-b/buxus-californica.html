<p>Buxus californica, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in formal garden designs.</p>
