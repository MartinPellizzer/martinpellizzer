                    <h1>Bidens chrysanthemoides</h1>
<p>Bidens chrysanthemoides, commonly known as the yellow beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers that resemble chrysanthemums. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can compete with native flora and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
