                    <h1>Boeicopsis yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Boeicopsis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan boeicopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent, while its small white flowers bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Boeicopsis yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
