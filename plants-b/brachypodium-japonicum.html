<p>Brachypodium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese false brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
