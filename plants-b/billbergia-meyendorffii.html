                    <h1>Billbergia meyendorffii</h1>
<p>Billbergia meyendorffii, commonly known as the Meyer's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular in ornamental horticulture for its ornate appearance and relatively low maintenance.</p>
