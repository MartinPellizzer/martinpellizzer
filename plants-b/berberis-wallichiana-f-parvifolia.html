                    <h1>Berberis wallichiana f. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis wallichiana f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a compact shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, foliage color, and seasonal floral and fruit displays.</p>
