<p>Bromus patulus var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to extreme climates and its role in stabilizing mountainous soils.</p>
