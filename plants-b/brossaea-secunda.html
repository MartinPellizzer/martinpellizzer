<p>Brossaea secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf brossaea, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety leaves and clusters of tubular, pinkish-purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
