<p>Bartlettina constipatiflora, commonly known as the thick-stemmed barlettiina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features elongated, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bartlettina constipatiflora is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
