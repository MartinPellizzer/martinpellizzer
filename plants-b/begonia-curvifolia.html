                    <h1>Begonia curvifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia curvifolia, commonly known as the curl-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, waxy, dark green leaves that curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display.</p>
