                    <h1>Baccharis paniculata</h1>
<p>Baccharis paniculata, commonly known as brittle bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Baccharis paniculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
