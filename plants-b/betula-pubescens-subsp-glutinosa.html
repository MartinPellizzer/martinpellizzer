<p>Betula pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are sticky to the touch, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>The sticky resin on its catkins is a distinctive feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
