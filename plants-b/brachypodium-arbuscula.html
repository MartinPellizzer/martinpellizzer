<p>Brachypodium arbuscula, commonly known as the little grass or dwarf brome, is a small annual grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that contain three to five flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Brachypodium arbuscula is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization.</p>
