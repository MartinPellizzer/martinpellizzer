<p>Brasiliopuntia, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly pear, is a cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit, known as a tunafruit, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Brasiliopuntia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens.</p>
