                    <h1>Brachystephanus yaudensis</h1>
<p>Brachystephanus yaudensis, commonly known as the Yaud√© cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded stem that often appears as a cluster of short, thick, greenish-gray tubercles. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptations in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
