<p>Bulga chamaepitys, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stem. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
