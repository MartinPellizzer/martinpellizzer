                    <h1>Bromus unioloides var. montanus</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique morphological traits compared to other bromus species.</p>
