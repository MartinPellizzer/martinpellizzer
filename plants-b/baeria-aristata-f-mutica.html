<p>Baeria aristata f. mutica, commonly known as the hairy baeria, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and store water, which helps it survive in low-rainfall areas.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
