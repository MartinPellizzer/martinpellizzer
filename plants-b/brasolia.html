                    <h1>Brasolia</h1>
<p>Brasolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Brasolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
