<p>Brunia purpurea, commonly known as the purple brunia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
