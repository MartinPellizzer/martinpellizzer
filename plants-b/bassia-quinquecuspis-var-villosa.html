                    <h1>Bassia quinquecuspis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Bassia quinquecuspis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy jointed grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
