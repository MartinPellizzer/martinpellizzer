<p>Balanophora subcupularis, commonly known as the cupular bellflower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
