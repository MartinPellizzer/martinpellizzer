                    <h1>Broughtonia grandiflora</h1>
<p>Broughtonia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Broughtonia grandiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens.</p>
