                    <h1>Batrachium eradicatum</h1>
<p>Batrachium eradicatum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble the shape of a frog, hence its scientific name. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Batrachium eradicatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
