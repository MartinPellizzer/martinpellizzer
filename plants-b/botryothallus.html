<p>Botryothallus, commonly known as the "buttercup lichen," is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, typically from the genus Peltigera. The thallus is usually bright yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly lobed surface. It often grows on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Botryothallus is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
