<p>Bupleurum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnate, with finely divided leaflets that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Bupleurum arcticum is adapted to survive in low temperatures and has a deep root system to access nutrients and water in poor soil conditions.</p>
