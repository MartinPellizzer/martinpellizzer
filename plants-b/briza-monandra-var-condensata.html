<p>Briza monandra var. condensata, commonly known as the dense feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are often clustered closely together, contributing to its dense growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
