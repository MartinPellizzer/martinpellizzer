<p>Brachypodium distachyon f. platystachyum, commonly known as the flat-stalked brachypodium, is a variant of the grass species Brachypodium distachyon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form. This plant is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or grasslands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-branched spikelets.</p>
<p>The flat-stalked form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variations and potential for genetic research.</p>
