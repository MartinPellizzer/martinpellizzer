                    <h1>Bromus arvensis var. pubiflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus arvensis var. pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubiflorous brome, is a variant of the annual brome grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) flower clusters, which distinguish it from other varieties of Bromus arvensis. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
