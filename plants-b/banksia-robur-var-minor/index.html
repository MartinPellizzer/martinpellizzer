                            <h1>Banksia Robur Var. Minor</h1>
<p>Banksia minor, scientifically known as Banksia robur var. minor, is a striking and resilient shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. This plant is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many other iconic Australian flora species. Its distinctive appearance, featuring cylindrical flower spikes and dense, needle-like leaves, makes it a popular choice for both ecological restoration and ornamental gardening. Banksia minor thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
