<p>Bayonia, commonly known as bayberry, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Bayonia is often used in hedges due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its leaves and fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine and for making candles.</p>
