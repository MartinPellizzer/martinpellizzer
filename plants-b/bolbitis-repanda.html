<p>Bolbitis repanda, commonly known as the creeping hart's tongue fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage.</p>
