<p>Bulbostylis sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, three-angled spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Bulbostylis sphaerocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
