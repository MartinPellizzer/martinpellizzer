                    <h1>Bromus madritensis var. ambiguus</h1>
<p>Bromus madritensis var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its morphological variability, which has led to confusion in its classification and identification.</p>
