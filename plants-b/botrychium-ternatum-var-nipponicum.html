                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum var. nipponicum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese moonwort, is a fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Botrychium ternatum.</p>
