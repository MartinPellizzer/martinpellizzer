<p>Botrychium charcoviense, commonly known as the Charcovenian moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium charcoviense is a rare species, with a limited distribution primarily in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
