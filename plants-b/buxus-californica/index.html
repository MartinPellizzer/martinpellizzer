                            <h1>Buxus Californica</h1>
<p>California boxwood, scientifically known as Buxus californica, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. This plant is prized for its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, adapting well to a variety of climate conditions. With its ability to tolerate pruning, it is often used in formal landscaping designs. Despite its resilience, it requires careful attention to avoid pests and diseases that can affect its health.</p>
