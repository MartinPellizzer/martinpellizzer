                    <h1>Bassia prostrata</h1>
<p>Bassia prostrata, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Bassia prostrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
