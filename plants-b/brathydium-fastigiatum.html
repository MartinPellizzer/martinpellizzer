                    <h1>Brathydium fastigiatum</h1>
<p>Brathydium fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats where it can attach to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the composition of plant communities in its environment.</p>
