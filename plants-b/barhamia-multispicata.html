<p>Barhamia multispicata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with numerous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and flowering during brief periods of rainfall.</p>
<p>Barhamia multispicata plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
