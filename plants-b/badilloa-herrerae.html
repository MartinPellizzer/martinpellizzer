<p>Badilloa herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's badilloa, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
