The plant is characterized by its fleshy, yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in association with hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
