                    <h1>Bassia</h1>
<p>Bassia, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaranth family.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annuals or perennials, characterized by their fibrous roots and branching stems. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. The leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>After flowering, the plants produce dry, papery seed pods that easily detach and scatter seeds, aiding in their widespread distribution.</p>
