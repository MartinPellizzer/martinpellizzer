                    <h1>Blechnum contiguum</h1>
<p>Blechnum contiguum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often resemble the shape of a stag's antlers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without deriving nutrients from its host. Its fronds are divided into a fertile and sterile portion, with the fertile fronds producing spores on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
