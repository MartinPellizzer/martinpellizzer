                    <h1>Botrychium lanuginosum var. leptostachyum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lanuginosum var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stalked moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a small, heart-shaped sorus that is covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The fronds are typically divided into a basal rosette and a terminal, elongated stalk, which is a key identifying feature. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
