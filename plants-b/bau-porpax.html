                <h1>Bau porpax</h1>
<p>Bau porpax, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically divided into two types: the sterile, elongated leaves that grow outward and the fertile, curled fronds that develop at the base. The plant's distinctive appearance resembles a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. It requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Bau porpax plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environments.</p>
