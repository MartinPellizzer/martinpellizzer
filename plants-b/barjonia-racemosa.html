<p>Barjonia racemosa, commonly known as the desert broom.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
