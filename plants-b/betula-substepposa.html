                    <h1>Betula substepposa</h1>
<p>Betula substepposa, commonly known as the steppe birch, is a shrub-like species native to the dry steppes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, papery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is often smooth and light-colored. Betula substepposa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
