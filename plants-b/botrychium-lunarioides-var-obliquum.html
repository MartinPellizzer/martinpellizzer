                    <h1>Botrychium lunarioides var. obliquum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunarioides var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features a fiddlehead-like structure that unfurls into a bipinnate frond with a distinct, often curved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its oblique or slanted frond arrangement, setting it apart from other members of the Botrychium genus.</p>
