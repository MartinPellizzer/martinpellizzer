<p>Banksia fraseri var. effusa is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is known for its unique, bottle-shaped flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange. This variation of the Banksia fraseri species is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
