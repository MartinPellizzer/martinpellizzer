<p>Berberis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>Berberis longipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.</p>
