                    <h1>Bogoria godeffroyana</h1>
<p>Bogoria godeffroyana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in boggy, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, waterlogged substrates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Bogoria godeffroyana is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
