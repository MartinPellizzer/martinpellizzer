                    <h1>Bacopa chamaedryoides</h1>
<p>Bacopa chamaedryoides, commonly known as creeping bacopa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Bacopa chamaedryoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
