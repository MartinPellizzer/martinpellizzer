<p>Brachylaena discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the red-hot poker tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
