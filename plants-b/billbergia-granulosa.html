                    <h1>Billbergia granulosa</h1>
<p>Billbergia granulosa, commonly known as the granular billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, granular texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces vibrant, spathaceous flowers that range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia granulosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
