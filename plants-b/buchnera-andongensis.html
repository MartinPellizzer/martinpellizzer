<p>Buchnera andongensis, commonly known as the Andong Buchnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buchnera andongensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
