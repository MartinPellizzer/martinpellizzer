                    <h1>Banksia salicifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures, called follicles, release seeds after a fire, aiding in its regeneration.</p>
<p>Banksia salicifolia is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
