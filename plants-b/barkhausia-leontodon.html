<p>Barkhausia leontodon, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often branched stems that resemble the shape of an elephant's foot. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its ability to store water in its stem makes it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small and scale-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
