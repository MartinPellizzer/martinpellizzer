                    <h1>Bolbitis difformis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis difformis, commonly known as the irregular fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and vary in size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis difformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
