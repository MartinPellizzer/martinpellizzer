                    <h1>Begonia psilophylla</h1>
<p>Begonia psilophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
