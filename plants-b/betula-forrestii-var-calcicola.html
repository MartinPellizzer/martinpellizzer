                    <h1>Betula forrestii var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Betula forrestii var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola birch, is a rare variant of the birch tree adapted to calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in areas with limestone substrates. The plant exhibits small, triangular leaves that are hairy on the underside, and it produces catkins that are typically yellow-green in color. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a spreading crown.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
