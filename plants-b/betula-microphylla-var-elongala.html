                    <h1>Betula microphylla var. elongala</h1>
<p>Betula microphylla var. elongala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. Its bark is smooth and white, similar to other birch species, but it tends to flake more prominently as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
