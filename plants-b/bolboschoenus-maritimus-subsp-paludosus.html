<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>paludosus, commonly known as swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
