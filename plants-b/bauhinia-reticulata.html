<p>Bauhinia reticulata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Bauhinia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
