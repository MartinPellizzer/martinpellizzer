                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of native plant communities in its range.</p>
