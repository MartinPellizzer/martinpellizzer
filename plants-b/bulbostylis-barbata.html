<p>Bulbostylis barbata, commonly known as the barbed bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils, often near water bodies or in swampy areas. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for small invertebrates.</p>
