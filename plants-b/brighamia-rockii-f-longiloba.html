                    <h1>Brighamia rockii f. longiloba</h1>
<p>Brighamia rockii f. longiloba, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Brighamia, is a unique Hawaiian plant belonging to the Asphodelaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of striking orange-red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its floral structure is specialized for pollination by native bees and moths, reflecting its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
