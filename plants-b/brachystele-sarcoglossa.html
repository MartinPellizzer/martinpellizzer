                    <h1>Brachystele sarcoglossa</h1>
<p>Brachystele sarcoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sarcoglossa, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, upright rhizome with numerous slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely divided, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
