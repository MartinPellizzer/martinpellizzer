<p>Brachystelma seshachalamense, commonly known as the Seshachalam rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rocky habitats of the Seshachalam hills in Andhra Pradesh, India.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive violet-blue color and a white lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
