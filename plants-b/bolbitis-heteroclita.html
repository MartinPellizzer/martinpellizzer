                    <h1>Bolbitis heteroclita</h1>
<p>Bolbitis heteroclita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth and dark green, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Bolbitis heteroclita is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
