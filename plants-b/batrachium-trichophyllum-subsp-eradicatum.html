<p>Batrachium trichophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>eradicatum, commonly known as the slender swamp mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
