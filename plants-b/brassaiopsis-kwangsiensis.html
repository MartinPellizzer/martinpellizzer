<p>Brassaiopsis kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi brassaiopsis, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its clustered growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its unique botanical features include a short stem with a tuft of leaves at the apex, making it visually distinct from other palms.</p>
