                    <h1>Berberis coquimbensis</h1>
<p>Berberis coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama barberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
