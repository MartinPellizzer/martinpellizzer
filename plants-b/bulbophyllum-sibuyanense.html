                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sibuyanense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan butterfly orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
