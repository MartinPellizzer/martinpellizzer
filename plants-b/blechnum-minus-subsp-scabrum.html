<p>Blechnum minus subsp.</p>
<p>scabrum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The subspecies scabrum is distinguished by its coarsely serrated leaf margins and dense, compact growth habit.</p>
