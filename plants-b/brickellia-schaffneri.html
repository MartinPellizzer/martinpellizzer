<p>Brickellia schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Brickellia schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
