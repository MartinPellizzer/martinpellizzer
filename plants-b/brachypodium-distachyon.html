                <h1>Brachypodium distachyon</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a small perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is widely used as a model organism in plant biology due to its compact genome, short life cycle, and genetic similarity to cereals like wheat and rice. The plant has a robust root system and produces dense, tufted foliage with spikelets containing two bracts. Its flowering is influenced by photoperiod, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon is also valued for its potential in biofuel production and ecological restoration.</p>
