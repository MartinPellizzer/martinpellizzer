                    <h1>Begonia merrittii</h1>
<p>Begonia merrittii, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets.</p>
