                    <h1>Brachystelma glenense</h1>
<p>Brachystelma glenense, commonly known as the Glen's ghost flower, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Native to South Africa, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
