                    <h1>Baccharis elaeoides</h1>
<p>Baccharis elaeoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Baccharis elaeoides is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in some Native American medicinal practices.</p>
