                    <h1>Berberis actinacantha var. minor</h1>
<p>Berberis actinacantha var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, glossy evergreen leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
