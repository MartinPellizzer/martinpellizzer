                            <h1>Betula Humilis Var. Vulgaris</h1>
<p>Betula humilis var. vulgaris is a small, deciduous tree native to the cold climates of northern Europe. It is known for its graceful, spreading form and delicate white flowers that appear in early spring. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soils. Its bark is smooth and gray, developing fissures as the tree matures. Despite its modest size, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
