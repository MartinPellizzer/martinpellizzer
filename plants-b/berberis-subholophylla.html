<p>Berberis subholophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
