<p>Bermudiana graminea, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the world.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is highly adaptable and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it is often considered both a valuable forage crop and a persistent weed.</p>
