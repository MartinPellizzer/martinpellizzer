The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
