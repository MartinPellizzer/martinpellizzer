<p>Begonia peruibensis, commonly known as the Peruvian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Begonia peruibensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds.</p>
