                    <h1>Baccharis subumbelliformis</h1>
<p>Baccharis subumbelliformis, commonly known as the slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
