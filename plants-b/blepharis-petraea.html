<p>Blepharis petraea, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptations include deep root systems and a ability to go dormant during droughts.</p>
<p>Blepharis petraea plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
