                    <h1>Bulbophyllum megalonyx</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum megalonyx, commonly known as the giant helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a helmet, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical environment. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
