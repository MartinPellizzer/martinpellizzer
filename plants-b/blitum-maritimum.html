<p>Blitum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant features silvery-blue leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces spiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
