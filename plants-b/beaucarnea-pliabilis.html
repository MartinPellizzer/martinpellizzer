<p>Beaucarnea pliabilis, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy base that resembles an elephant's foot, which stores water for drought tolerance. The plant has a short, upright stem with sparse, leathery leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
