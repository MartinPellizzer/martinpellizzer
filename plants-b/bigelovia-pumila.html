<p>It features a woody root system and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Bigelovia pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>
