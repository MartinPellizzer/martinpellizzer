<p>Bassia prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>grisea, commonly known as gray sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish or whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
