<p>Banksia nutans var. cernuella, commonly known as the drooping banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping, cylindrical inflorescences that bear yellow to orange flowers, which are visited by a variety of pollinators including honeyeaters and birds. The plant produces woody follicles that release seeds after fire, a common adaptation in its fire-prone habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant communities.</p>
