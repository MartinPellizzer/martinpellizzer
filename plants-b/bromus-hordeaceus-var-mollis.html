                    <h1>Bromus hordeaceus var. mollis</h1>
<p>Bromus hordeaceus var. mollis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Smooth brome is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment.</p>
