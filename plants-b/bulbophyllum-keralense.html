                    <h1>Bulbophyllum keralense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum keralense, commonly known as the Keralan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
