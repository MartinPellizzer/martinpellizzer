                    <h1>Banksia ferrea</h1>
<p>Banksia ferrea, commonly known as the ironwood banksia, is a tall shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which gives it its common name and makes it highly valued for timber. The plant produces striking yellow flower spikes that appear in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia ferrea plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and shelter for native wildlife.</p>
