                    <h1>Bartsia scordifolia</h1>
<p>Bartsia scordifolia, commonly known as the stinking bartsia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Bartsia scordifolia is characterized by its distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is likely an adaptation to attract specific pollinators.</p>
