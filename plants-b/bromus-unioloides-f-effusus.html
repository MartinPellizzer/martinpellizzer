                    <h1>Bromus unioloides f. effusus</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides f. effusus, commonly known as the soft bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are typically curled at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in disturbed environments.</p>
