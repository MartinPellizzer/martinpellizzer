<p>Botrychium simplex f. laxifolium, commonly known as the loose-leaved moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a small, heart-shaped sporangium that is often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a delicate, fern-like structure. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
