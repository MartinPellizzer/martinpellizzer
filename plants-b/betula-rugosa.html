                    <h1>Betula rugosa</h1>
<p>Betula rugosa, commonly known as the rough birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that develops fissures with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
