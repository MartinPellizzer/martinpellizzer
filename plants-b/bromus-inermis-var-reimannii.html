                    <h1>Bromus inermis var. reimannii</h1>
<p>Bromus inermis var. reimannii, commonly known as Reimann's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as disturbed soils, rocky areas, and sagebrush communities. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions.</p>
