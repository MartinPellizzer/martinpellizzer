                    <h1>Breynia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Breynia lanceolata, commonly known as the fire tree, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Breynia lanceolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
