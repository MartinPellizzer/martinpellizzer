<p>Bidens frondosa var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands.</p>
