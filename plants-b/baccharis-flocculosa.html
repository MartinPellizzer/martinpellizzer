<p>Baccharis flocculosa, commonly known as white sagebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Baccharis flocculosa plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
