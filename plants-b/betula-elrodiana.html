                    <h1>Betula elrodiana</h1>
<p>Betula elrodiana, commonly known as the Elrod's birch, is a rare and little-studied species of birch native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and smooth, white bark, similar to other birch species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in association with other hardwoods. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Betula elrodiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
