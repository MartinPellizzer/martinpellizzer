                    <h1>Brachychiton</h1>
<p>Brachychiton, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, swollen trunks that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the flowers are showy, often in shades of red, pink, or yellow. Brachychiton species are popular ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>They play an important role in both ecological systems and horticultural landscapes.</p>
