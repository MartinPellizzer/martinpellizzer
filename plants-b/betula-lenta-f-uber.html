                    <h1>Betula lenta f. uber</h1>
<p>Betula lenta f. uber, commonly known as the sugar birch, is a variant of the yellow birch tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and smooth, pale trunk.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mixed hardwood forests. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark contains essential oils and has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes.</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree is a winged nut that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its natural range expansion.</p>
