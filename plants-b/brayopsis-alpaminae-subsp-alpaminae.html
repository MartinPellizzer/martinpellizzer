<p>Brayopsis alpaminae subsp.</p>
<p>alpaminae, commonly known as the alpine brayopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species.</p>
