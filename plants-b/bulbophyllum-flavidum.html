                    <h1>Bulbophyllum flavidum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum flavidum, commonly known as the yellow bulbophyllum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with thin, wiry leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade.</p>
