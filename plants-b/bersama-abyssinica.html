<p>Bersama abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Bersama abyssinica is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
