<p>Begonia soluta, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display.</p>
