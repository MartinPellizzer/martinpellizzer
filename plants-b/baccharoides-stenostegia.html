                    <h1>Baccharoides stenostegia</h1>
<p>Baccharoides stenostegia, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Baccharoides stenostegia is well adapted to harsh, desert-like conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
