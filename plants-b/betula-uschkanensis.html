                    <h1>Betula uschkanensis</h1>
<p>Betula uschkanensis, commonly known as the Uschkan Island birch, is a small deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and the northern regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that often peels in thin strips, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
