                            <h1>Berberis Usteriana</h1>
<p>Mexican barberry, scientifically known as Berberis usteriana, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems, bright green leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are both ornamental and edible, though they are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, Mexican barberry has become a valued plant in both native and cultivated landscapes.</p>
