<p>Baccharis arborescens, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Baccharis arborescens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats.</p>
