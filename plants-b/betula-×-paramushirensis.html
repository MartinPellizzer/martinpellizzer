                    <h1>Betula × paramushirensis</h1>
<p>Betula × paramushirensis, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula platyphylla and Betula maximowiczii.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and cream. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is native to eastern Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
