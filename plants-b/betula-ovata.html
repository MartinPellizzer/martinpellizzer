                    <h1>Betula ovata</h1>
<p>Betula ovata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula ovata is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
