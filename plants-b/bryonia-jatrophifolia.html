                    <h1>Bryonia jatrophifolia</h1>
<p>Bryonia jatrophifolia, commonly known as the Jerusalem thorn, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and spiny stems.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture.</p>
