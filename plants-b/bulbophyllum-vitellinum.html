                    <h1>Bulbophyllum vitellinum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum vitellinum, commonly known as the yellow bulbophyllum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum vitellinum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
