                    <h1>Bistorta stenophylla</h1>
<p>Bistorta stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant features upright, cylindrical stems that are covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bistorta stenophylla is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
