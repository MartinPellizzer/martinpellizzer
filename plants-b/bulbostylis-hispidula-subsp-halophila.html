<p>Bulbostylis hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh bulbostylis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It is well adapted to high-salinity environments, with specialized structures that help it retain water and exclude excess salt.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
