                    <h1>Bulbophyllum lumbriciforme</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum lumbriciforme, commonly known as the earthworm orchid, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its peculiar, worm-like appearance, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment, and it thrives in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>This orchid is primarily epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
