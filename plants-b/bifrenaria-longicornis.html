<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach several feet in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant features a thick, fibrous rhizome that helps it anchor to rocky or tree surfaces.

<p>Bifrenaria longicornis is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
