<p>Berberis conferta var. spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent berries throughout the winter.</p>
