<p>Bougainvillea brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bougainvillea brachycarpa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
