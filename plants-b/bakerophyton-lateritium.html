                    <h1>Bakerophyton lateritium</h1>
<p>Bakerophyton lateritium, commonly known as the red sandstone liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous or sandy soils. The plant exhibits a distinct reddish coloration due to the presence of anthocyanins, which may serve as a protective adaptation against environmental stress. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Bakerophyton lateritium is often found in rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain soil types and microclimates.</p>
