                <h1>Betula tortuosa</h1>
<p>Betula tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisting trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Betula tortuosa is adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found at high elevations where it forms part of the local flora.</p>
