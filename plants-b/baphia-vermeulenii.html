                    <h1>Baphia vermeulenii</h1>
<p>Baphia vermeulenii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
