                    <h1>Buxus latistyla</h1>
<p>Buxus latistyla, commonly known as the broad-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are broader than those of typical boxwoods. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for topiary and hedging.</p>
