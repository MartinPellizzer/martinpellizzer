<p>Begonia scharffiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care.</p>
<p>Its varietal form, var. minor, is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the standard Begonia scharffiana.</p>
