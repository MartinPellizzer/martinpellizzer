                    <h1>Barleria deserticola</h1>
<p>Barleria deserticola, commonly known as desert barleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Barleria deserticola is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
