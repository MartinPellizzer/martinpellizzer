<p>Betula alba foliis-atropurpureis, commonly known as the purple-barked birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, smooth bark that often develops a reddish-purple hue as it ages. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive bark and seasonal color changes.</p>
