<p>Brownanthus namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian brownanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season. The plant has adapted to the harsh, arid environment by developing deep root systems to access water. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Brownanthus namibensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
