                    <h1>Bulbophyllum dubium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum dubium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
