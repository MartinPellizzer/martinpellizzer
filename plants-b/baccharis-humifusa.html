                    <h1>Baccharis humifusa</h1>
<p>Baccharis humifusa, commonly known as dwarf baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 feet and features dense, mat-forming foliage that helps prevent soil erosion. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in panicles during the late summer to early fall. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Baccharis humifusa is often found in sandy soils along coastal areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
