<p>Bruguiera eriopetala, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Bruguiera eriopetala is also important in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection.</p>
