<p>Blechnum simillimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
