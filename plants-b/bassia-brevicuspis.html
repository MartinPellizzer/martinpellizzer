                    <h1>Bassia brevicuspis</h1>
<p>Bassia brevicuspis, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Bassia brevicuspis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
