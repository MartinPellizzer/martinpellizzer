                    <h1>Begonia cucullata var. spatulata</h1>
<p>Begonia cucullata var. spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
