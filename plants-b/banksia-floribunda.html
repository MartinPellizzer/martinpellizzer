                    <h1>Banksia floribunda</h1>
<p>Banksia floribunda, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically pale yellow to cream in color. The plant produces large, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax.</p>
<p>Banksia floribunda is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with a period of dormancy during the dry season.</p>
