                    <h1>Blechnum longipinna</h1>
<p>Blechnum longipinna, commonly known as the long-pinnate hakea, is a fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer called a indusium.</p>
<p>Blechnum longipinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats.</p>
