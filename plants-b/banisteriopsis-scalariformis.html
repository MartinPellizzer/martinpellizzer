                    <h1>Banisteriopsis scalariformis</h1>
<p>Banisteriopsis scalariformis, commonly known as the "Brazil nut tree," is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which is a hard, woody capsule containing several seeds, each encased in a toxic, resinous covering. The seeds, once the resin is removed, are the edible Brazil nuts sold globally.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
