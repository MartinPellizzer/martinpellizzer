                    <h1>Betula rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Betula rotundifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Betula rotundifolia is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and tolerating low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in tundra and boreal ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
