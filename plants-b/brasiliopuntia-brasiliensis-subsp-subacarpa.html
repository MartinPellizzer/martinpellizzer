<p>Brasiliopuntia brasiliensis subsp.</p>
<p>subacarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian apple cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other members of the Brasiliopuntia genus.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
