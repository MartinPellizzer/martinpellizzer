<p>Bellis sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>pappulosa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in spring and early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name.</p>
