                    <h1>Betula alba f. verrucosa</h1>
<p>Betula alba f. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive, rough, and warty bark.</p>
<p>This unique texture is caused by the presence of raised, corky projections on the trunk, which provide structural support and protection against environmental stress. The plant is a deciduous tree with slender, white-barked trunks and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The warty birch is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a variety of wildlife species.</p>
