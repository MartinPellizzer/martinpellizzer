<p>Bartonia paniculata subsp.</p>
<p>iodandra, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
