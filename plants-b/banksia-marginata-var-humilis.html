                    <h1>Banksia marginata var. humilis</h1>
<p>Banksia marginata var. humilis, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical, yellow-tinged flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces woody cones that release seeds after a fire, a feature typical of many species in the Proteaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
