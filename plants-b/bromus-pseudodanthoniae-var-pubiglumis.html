The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense, low-growing turf.</p>
