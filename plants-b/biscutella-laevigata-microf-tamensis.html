<p>Biscutella laevigata microf.</p>
<p>tamensis, commonly known as the Tamaskan biscutella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited conservation efforts in place.</p>
