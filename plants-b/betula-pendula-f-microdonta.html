                    <h1>Betula pendula f. microdonta</h1>
<p>Betula pendula f. microdonta, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a unique variant of the silver birch characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive cascading appearance.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are small, triangular, and have a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy, though it may be susceptible to certain pests and diseases.</p>
