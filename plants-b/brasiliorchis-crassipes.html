                    <h1>Brasiliorchis crassipes</h1>
<p>Brasiliorchis crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often dry habitat. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring a lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth near rivers or in humid forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
