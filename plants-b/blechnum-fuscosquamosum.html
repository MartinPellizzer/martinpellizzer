<p>Blechnum fuscosquamosum, commonly known as the black-scale harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-green fronds that are often covered in a layer of dark, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips.</p>
