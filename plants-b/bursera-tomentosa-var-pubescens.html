                    <h1>Bursera tomentosa var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Bursera tomentosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
