<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Brenesia is also valued for its cultural significance among indigenous communities.</p>
