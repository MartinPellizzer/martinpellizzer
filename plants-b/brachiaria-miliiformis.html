<p>Brachiaria miliiformis, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It thrives in wet, low-fertility soils and is commonly found in grasslands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Brachiaria miliiformis is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings.</p>
