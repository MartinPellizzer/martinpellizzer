                    <h1>Botrychium simplex var. angustum</h1>
<p>Botrychium simplex var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, two-part fronds that resemble a heart shape, with the upper frond being narrower than the lower one. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the lower frond, a feature typical of the genus Botrychium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
