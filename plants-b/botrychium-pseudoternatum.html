<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often bi-lobed fronds that resemble a heart or a crescent shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium pseudoternatum is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters.</p>
