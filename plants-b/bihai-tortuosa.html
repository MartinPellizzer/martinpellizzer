                    <h1>Bihai tortuosa</h1>
<p>Bihai tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted sea holly, is a striking succulent native to the coastal regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. Its unique, twisted growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Bihai tortuosa is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it ideal for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
