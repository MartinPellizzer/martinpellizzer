                    <h1>Biscutella didyma f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Biscutella didyma f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth biscutella, is a rare, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) foliage, which sets it apart from other forms of Biscutella didyma. It typically thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
