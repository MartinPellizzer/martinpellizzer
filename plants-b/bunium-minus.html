                    <h1>Bunium minus</h1>
<p>Bunium minus, commonly known as lesser fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with umbels of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong anise-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage and seeds. Bunium minus typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small, ribbed, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
