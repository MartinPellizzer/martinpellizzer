                    <h1>Bolbitis appendiculata</h1>
<p>Bolbitis appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged, with a creeping rhizome that helps it spread. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis appendiculata is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled water conditions.</p>
