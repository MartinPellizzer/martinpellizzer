                    <h1>Bromus erectus var. glabriflorus</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved brome, is a grass species native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy leaves, which distinguish it from other brome species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with glabrous (hairless) flowers, contributing to its specific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in prairies and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
