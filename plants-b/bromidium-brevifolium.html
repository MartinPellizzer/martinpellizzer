                    <h1>Bromidium brevifolium</h1>
<p>Bromidium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved bromeliad, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Bromidium brevifolium is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
