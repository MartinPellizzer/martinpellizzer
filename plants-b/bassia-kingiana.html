<p>Bassia kingiana, commonly known as silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
