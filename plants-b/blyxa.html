<p>Blyxa, commonly known as the water starwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and dense, grass-like foliage that often forms mats on the surface or submerged in water. Blyxa species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Some species are also used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
