                    <h1>Bassia laevifolia</h1>
<p>Bassia laevifolia, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bassia laevifolia is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access underground water sources.</p>
