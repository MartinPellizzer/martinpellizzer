<p>Buxus handsworthii, commonly known as the Handsworth boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that remains lush throughout the year, making it highly ornamental. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is a popular choice for formal garden designs.</p>
