                    <h1>Bilderdykia cristata</h1>
<p>Bilderdykia cristata, commonly known as the spiked broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to host plants via haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. It is often found in grasslands and open habitats where it parasitizes various grass species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
