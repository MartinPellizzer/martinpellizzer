                    <h1>Berberis temolaica var. artisepala</h1>
<p>Berberis temolaica var. artisepala, commonly known as the Articulate-leaf Barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>
