                    <h1>Bituminaria basaltica</h1>
<p>Bituminaria basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic bituminous plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark, almost black foliage that resembles bitumen, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle contrast to its dark leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bituminaria basaltica is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
