                    <h1>Balanophora forbesii</h1>
<p>Balanophora forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild.</p>
