                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. villosus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but now invasive in many parts of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous seeds. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is highly adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in altering ecosystems by outcompeting native vegetation and increasing the risk of wildfires.</p>
