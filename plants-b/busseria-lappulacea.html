<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Busseria lappulacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important part of the flora in its native ecosystems.</p>
