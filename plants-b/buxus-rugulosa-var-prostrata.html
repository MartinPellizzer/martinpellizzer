<p>Buxus rugulosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly rough texture, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in formal landscapes and borders.</p>
