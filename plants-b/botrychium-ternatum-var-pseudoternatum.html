                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum var. pseudoternatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum var. pseudoternatum, commonly known as the false moonwort, is a fern species native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds with a unique structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are arranged in a specific pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other Botrychium species due to its similar morphology.</p>
