<p>Bulbophyllum schinzianum var. irigaleae, commonly known as the Iragala orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a contrasting yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its often humid and shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
