<p>Blepharis bossii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
