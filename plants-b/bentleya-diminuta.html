<p>Bentleya diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf bentleya, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bentleya diminuta is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species.</p>
