                    <h1>Biotia viscosa</h1>
<p>Biotia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky biotia, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Biotia viscosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
