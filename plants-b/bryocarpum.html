                    <h1>Bryocarpum</h1>
<p>Bryocarpum, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Bryocarpum species are often submerged or floating, with simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both predators and prey, contributing to the food web.</p>
