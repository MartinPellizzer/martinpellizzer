<p>Bromus tectorum subsp.</p>
<p>longipilus, commonly known as the long-haired cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 stems and long, silky hairs on the leaf blades and inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and high seed production, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
