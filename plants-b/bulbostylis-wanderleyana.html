<p>Bulbostylis wanderleyana, commonly known as the wandering grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming colonies in suitable environments.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
