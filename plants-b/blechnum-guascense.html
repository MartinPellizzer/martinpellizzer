<p>Blechnum guascense, commonly known as the Guascense maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
