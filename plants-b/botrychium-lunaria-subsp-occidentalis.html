<p>Botrychium lunaria subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a small fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread B. lunaria.</p>
