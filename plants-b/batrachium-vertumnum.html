                    <h1>Batrachium vertumnum</h1>
<p>Batrachium vertumnum, commonly known as the moonshade vine, is a climbing plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety underside and produces striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly at night. The plant's roots are known to exude a sticky, sap-like substance that has been used in traditional medicine. Its unique nocturnal blooming pattern makes it a subject of fascination for botanists and ecologists.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
