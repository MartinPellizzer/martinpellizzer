                    <h1>Betula microphylla var. rezniczenkoana</h1>
<p>Betula microphylla var. rezniczenkoana, commonly known as the Reznicek's birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among birch species. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slightly fibrous texture.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
