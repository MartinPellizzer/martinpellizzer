                    <h1>Betula pubescens f. parallela</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens f. parallela, commonly known as the parallel-leaf birch, is a rare and distinctive form of the silver birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with parallel venation that sets it apart from other birch species. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its leaves are smaller and more narrow compared to the typical silver birch, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological uniqueness.</p>
