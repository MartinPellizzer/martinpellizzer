<p>Bromopsis erecta subsp.</p>
<p>microchaeta, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
