<p>Bactris tucum, commonly known as the tucum or tucum√°, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil and parts of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the areca palm, with a fibrous outer layer and a sweet, starchy pulp inside. Its leaves are used in traditional basket weaving, and the plant is valued for both its ecological and economic importance.</p>
<p>Bactris tucum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
