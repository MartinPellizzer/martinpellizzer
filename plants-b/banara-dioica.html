                    <h1>Banara dioica</h1>
<p>Banara dioica, commonly known as the sacred fig or bodhi tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable botanical feature. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The tree is also culturally significant, particularly in Buddhist traditions, where it is associated with the enlightenment of the Buddha.</p>
