                    <h1>Betula alba lusus microphylla</h1>
<p>Betula alba lusus microphylla, commonly known as the white birch with dwarf leaves, is a rare variant of the white birch species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to typical Betula alba. The plant exhibits a slender, upright growth habit with a distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin layers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in northern temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution.</p>
