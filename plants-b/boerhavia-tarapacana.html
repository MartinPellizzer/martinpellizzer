                    <h1>Boerhavia tarapacana</h1>
<p>Boerhavia tarapacana, commonly known as the Atacama morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly the Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions with deep roots and a succulent stem that stores water. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Boerhavia tarapacana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in dry climates.</p>
