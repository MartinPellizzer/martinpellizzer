                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum var. daedaleum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum var. daedaleum, commonly known as the fairy fan fern, is a delicate fern species native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a fan or a network of delicate threads. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
