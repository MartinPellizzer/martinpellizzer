                    <h1>Bletia corallicola</h1>
<p>Bletia corallicola, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking coral-pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve water in its humid, low-light habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bletia corallicola is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
