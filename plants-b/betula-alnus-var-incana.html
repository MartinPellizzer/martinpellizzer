<p>Betula alnus var. incana, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and river valleys.</p>
<p>Betula alnus var. incana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
