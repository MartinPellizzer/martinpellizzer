<p>Berberis macracantha, commonly known as the giant barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny nature, it is often used as a hedge or boundary plant in gardens.</p>
