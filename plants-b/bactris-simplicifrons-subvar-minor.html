<p>Bactris simplicifrons subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a compact, slow-growing palm native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically shorter than those of the main species. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by edible, sweet, and fibrous fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
