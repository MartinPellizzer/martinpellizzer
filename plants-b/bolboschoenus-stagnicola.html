                    <h1>Bolboschoenus stagnicola</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus stagnicola, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saturated soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cones at the tips of its stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store nutrients and survive in fluctuating water conditions.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus stagnicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
