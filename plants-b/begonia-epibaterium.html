                    <h1>Begonia epibaterium</h1>
<p>Begonia epibaterium, commonly known as the ghost begonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, and its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
