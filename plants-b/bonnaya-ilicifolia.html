                    <h1>Bonnaya ilicifolia</h1>
<p>Bonnaya ilicifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, pencil-like roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a reddish hue, which aid in reducing water loss in saline conditions. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by black, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Bonnaya ilicifolia plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
