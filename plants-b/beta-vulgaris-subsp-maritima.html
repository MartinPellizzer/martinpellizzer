<p>Beta vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as sea beet, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, edible seeds. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Sea beet is often found in tidal zones and is valued for its salt tolerance and ornamental qualities.</p>
