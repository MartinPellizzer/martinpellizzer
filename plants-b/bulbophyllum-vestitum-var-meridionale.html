The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections.</p>
