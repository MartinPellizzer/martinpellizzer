                    <h1>Buprestis coriacea</h1>
<p>Buprestis coriacea, commonly known as the rough jewel beetle, is a species of metallic wood-boring beetle belonging to the family Buprestidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, often iridescent exoskeleton, which can range in color from metallic green to blue or bronze. The larvae of Buprestis coriacea are known to feed on the wood of various host trees, contributing to the natural decomposition process in forest ecosystems. The adult beetles are typically found in forested areas, where they lay their eggs in the bark or wood of host trees.</p>
<p>Due to their ecological role in nutrient cycling, they are considered an important part of forest biodiversity.</p>
