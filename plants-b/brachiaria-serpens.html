                    <h1>Brachiaria serpens</h1>
<p>Brachiaria serpens, commonly known as slinkgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across open areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Brachiaria serpens is commonly found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control.</p>
