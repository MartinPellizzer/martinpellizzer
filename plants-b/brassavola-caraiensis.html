<p>Brassavola caraiensis, commonly known as the Carai orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive green throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
