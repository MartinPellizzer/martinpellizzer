                    <h1>Banksia ledifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia ledifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open.</p>
<p>Banksia ledifolia is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that store seeds until after a fire, aiding in regeneration.</p>
