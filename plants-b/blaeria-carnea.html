                    <h1>Blaeria carnea</h1>
<p>Blaeria carnea, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>Blaeria carnea plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling through the digestion of aquatic organisms.</p>
