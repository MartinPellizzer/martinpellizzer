                    <h1>Brachypodium patens</h1>
<p>Brachypodium patens, commonly known as the shortgrass or green bristlegrass, is a small, annual grass species native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized for its small stature, typically growing to a height of 10â€“30 cm, and its dense, tufted foliage. This plant is particularly notable for its rapid growth rate and short life cycle, which make it an ideal model organism in plant biology research. Its genome has been fully sequenced, contributing significantly to the understanding of grass genetics and evolution.</p>
<p>Additionally, Brachypodium patens is used in studies related to bioenergy and climate resilience due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
