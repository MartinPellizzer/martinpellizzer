                    <h1>Balanites aegyptiaca var. pallida</h1>
<p>Balanites aegyptiaca var. pallida, commonly known as the pale desert date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing a single large seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard wood and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes.</p>
