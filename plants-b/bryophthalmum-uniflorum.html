                    <h1>Bryophthalmum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Bryophthalmum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered moss-eyed plant, is a rare and unique member of the liverwort family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that appears at the end of its stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, and it plays a minor but important role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
