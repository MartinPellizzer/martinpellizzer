                    <h1>Briza minor var. virens</h1>
<p>Briza minor var. virens, commonly known as green oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage that displays a distinct green hue, which is more vibrant than the typical silver-green of the standard Briza minor. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a graceful touch to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
