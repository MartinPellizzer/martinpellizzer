                    <h1>Biermannia naja</h1>
<p>Biermannia naja, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique root system that absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Biermannia naja is considered critically endangered in many regions.</p>
