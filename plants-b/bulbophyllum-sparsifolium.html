                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sparsifolium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
