                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. brevisetum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. brevisetum, commonly known as the short-setose brachypodium, is a grass species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more dense inflorescence compared to the typical variety. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-branched spikes that bear florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued in botanical research for its genetic similarity to wheat and its use as a model organism in plant biology.</p>
