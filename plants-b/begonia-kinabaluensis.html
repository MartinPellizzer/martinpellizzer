<p>Begonia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu begonia, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green or reddish hue. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the mountain's montane rainforest.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
