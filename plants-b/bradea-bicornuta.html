                    <h1>Bradea bicornuta</h1>
<p>Bradea bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned bradea, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bi-lobed or horn-like structures on its fruit, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, while its flowers form small, clustered umbels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bradea bicornuta is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
