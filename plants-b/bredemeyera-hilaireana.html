<p>Bredemeyera hilaireana, commonly known as the Hilaireana cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
