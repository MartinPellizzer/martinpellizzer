                    <h1>Bromus longifolius</h1>
<p>Bromus longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with each spikelet containing several small, two-rowed flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Bromus longifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
