<p>Bulbophyllum tryssum, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum tryssum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
