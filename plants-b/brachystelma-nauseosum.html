<p>Brachystelma nauseosum, commonly known as the stinking ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a distinctive, unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Brachystelma nauseosum is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
