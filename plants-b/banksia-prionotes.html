<p>Banksia prionotes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Banksia prionotes is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
