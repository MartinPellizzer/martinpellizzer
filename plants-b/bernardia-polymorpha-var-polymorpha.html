                    <h1>Bernardia polymorpha var. polymorpha</h1>
<p>Bernardia polymorpha var. polymorpha, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and aiding in oxygen absorption in submerged conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
