                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens f. bullata</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens f. bullata, commonly known as the bullate boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its slow growth and dense, rounded form.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly puckered, giving the plant its distinctive "bullate" appearance. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, fertile soil with partial to full sun exposure. It is often used in formal gardens for its neat, sculptural shape and ability to be pruned into intricate forms.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
