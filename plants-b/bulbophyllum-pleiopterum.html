                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pleiopterum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pleiopterum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that can resemble moonlight, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
