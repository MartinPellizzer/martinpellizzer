<p>Bignonia quercus, commonly known as the oakleaf bignonia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that resemble oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange tubular flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Bignonia quercus is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
