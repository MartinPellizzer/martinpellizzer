<p>Borraginoides aculeata, commonly known as the prickly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its spiny, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive, sometimes prickly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Borraginoides aculeata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
