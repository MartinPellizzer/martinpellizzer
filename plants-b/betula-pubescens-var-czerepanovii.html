                    <h1>Betula pubescens var. czerepanovii</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens var. czerepanovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>The tree is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in marginal areas.</p>
