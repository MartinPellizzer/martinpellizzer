                    <h1>Boswellia</h1>
<p>Boswellia, commonly known as frankincense, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>These trees are native to dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The sap of Boswellia trees is tapped and solidifies into a resin, which has been used for centuries in religious and medicinal practices. The resin contains boswellic acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's unique aroma and therapeutic uses have made it a valuable resource in traditional and modern medicine.</p>
