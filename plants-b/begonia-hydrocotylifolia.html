                    <h1>Begonia hydrocotylifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its association with water, as "hydrocotylifolia" refers to the leaf structure resembling that of water plants.</p>
