                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon f. brevisetum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon f. brevisetum, commonly known as the short-setose grass, is a variant of the model plant Brachypodium distachyon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely arranged inflorescence compared to the typical form. The plant exhibits a C4 photosynthetic pathway, making it efficient in hot and dry environments. Its genome has been extensively studied, contributing to research in grass genetics and bioenergy crops.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological and agricultural studies due to its adaptability and genetic tractability.</p>
