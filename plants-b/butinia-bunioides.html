                    <h1>Butinia bunioides</h1>
<p>Butinia bunioides, commonly known as the Bunioides thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant produces a spiny, globular fruit known as a cypsela, which is adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Butinia bunioides is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
