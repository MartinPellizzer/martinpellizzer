                    <h1>Brassica insularis var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Brassica insularis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Azores cabbage, is a rare and endemic species native to the Azores Islands.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant characterized by its compact rosette of thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a terminal raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly bitter taste, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
