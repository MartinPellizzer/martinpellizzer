                    <h1>Balanophora capensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora capensis, commonly known as the Cape ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
