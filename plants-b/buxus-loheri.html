<p>Buxus loheri, commonly known as the Loher's boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red-brown berries. Buxus loheri thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and resilience to pruning make it a popular choice for topiary and landscape design.</p>
