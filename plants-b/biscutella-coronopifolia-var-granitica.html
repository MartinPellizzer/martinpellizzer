                    <h1>Biscutella coronopifolia var. granitica</h1>
<p>Biscutella coronopifolia var. granitica, commonly known as the granite biscutella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky terrain.</p>
