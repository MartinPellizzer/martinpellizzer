                    <h1>Bromelia gigantea</h1>
<p>Bromelia gigantea, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its size and visual impact, Bromelia gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
