                            <h1>Barbacenia Humilis</h1>
<p>Common groundsel, scientifically known as Barbacenia humilis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh conditions. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations. Its presence often indicates healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
