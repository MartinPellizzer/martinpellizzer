                    <h1>Berberis simulans</h1>
<p>Berberis simulans, commonly known as the Himalayan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall color and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
