<p>Begonia rubricaulis var. volcanensis, commonly known as the Volcanic Begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are small and tubular, typically appearing in clusters, and it is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
