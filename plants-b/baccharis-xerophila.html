                    <h1>Baccharis xerophila</h1>
<p>Baccharis xerophila, commonly known as the desert baccharis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to survive in poor soils and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>Baccharis xerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
