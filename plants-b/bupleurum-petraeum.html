<p>Bupleurum petraeum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, limestone-rich soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender, branched stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Bupleurum petraeum is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
