                            <h1>Biscutella Lyrata Var. Apula</h1>
<p>Biscutella lyrata var. apula is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its delicate, lyre-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical gem from further decline.</p>
