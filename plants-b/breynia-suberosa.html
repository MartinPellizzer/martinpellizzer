                    <h1>Breynia suberosa</h1>
<p>Breynia suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf breynia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in a rough, bark-like texture, which provides additional protection against drought.</p>
<p>Breynia suberosa is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
