                    <h1>Bolbitis bradfordii</h1>
<p>Bolbitis bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradford's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis bradfordii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
