<p>Bupleurum longeradiatum var. breviradiatum, commonly known as the short-rayed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
