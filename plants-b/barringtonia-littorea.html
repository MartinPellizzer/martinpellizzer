The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a distinctive fragrance, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
