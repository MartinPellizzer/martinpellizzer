                    <h1>Bromelia viridis</h1>
<p>Bromelia viridis, commonly known as the green bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom for several weeks.</p>
<p>Bromelia viridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
