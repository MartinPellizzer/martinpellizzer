                    <h1>Bromus arvensis var. diffusus</h1>
<p>Bromus arvensis var. diffusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with丛生的叶片 that are often broader and more spreading than those of the typical Bromus arvensis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous short, awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
