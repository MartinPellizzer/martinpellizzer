                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. robustus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. robustus, commonly known as cheatgrass, is an annual grass species native to Eurasia but now invasive in many parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is highly competitive, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and flammable seeds, it plays a significant role in increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
