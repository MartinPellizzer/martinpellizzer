                    <h1>Beloperone lanceolata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Beloperone lanceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved beloperone, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader, more lanceolate leaves compared to the typical form, with a smooth, sometimes hairy surface. The plant produces small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
