                    <h1>Baccharoides dumicola</h1>
<p>Baccharoides dumicola, commonly known as the desert baccharis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and drought tolerance make it a hardy species well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Baccharoides dumicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
