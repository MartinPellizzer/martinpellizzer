                    <h1>Biarum tenuifolium var. abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Biarum tenuifolium var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, trimerous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are shorter than those of the typical Biarum tenuifolium, hence its varietal name. It prefers shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in rich, humus-filled soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
