<p>Brachypodium pinnatum var. ramosum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
