                    <h1>Betula purpurea</h1>
<p>Betula purpurea, commonly known as the purple birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, branching habit. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn a striking yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
