                    <h1>Baccharis caespitosa var. surculosa</h1>
<p>Baccharis caespitosa var. surculosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that reflects light effectively. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in the fall and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form low, mounded shapes, often used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
