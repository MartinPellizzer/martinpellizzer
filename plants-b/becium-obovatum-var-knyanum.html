The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
