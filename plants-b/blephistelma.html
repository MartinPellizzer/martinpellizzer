                    <h1>Blephistelma</h1>
<p>Blephistelma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, delicate leaves are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Blephistelma is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
