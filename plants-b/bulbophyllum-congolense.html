                    <h1>Bulbophyllum congolense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum congolense, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
