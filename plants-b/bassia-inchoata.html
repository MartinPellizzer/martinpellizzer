                    <h1>Bassia inchoata</h1>
<p>Bassia inchoata, commonly known as sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are often mistaken for seeds, which can adhere to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
