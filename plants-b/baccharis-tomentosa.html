                    <h1>Baccharis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Baccharis tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Baccharis tomentosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value.</p>
