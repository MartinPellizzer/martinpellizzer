                    <h1>Bolelia montana</h1>
<p>Bolelia montana, commonly known as the mountain bolelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Bolelia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
