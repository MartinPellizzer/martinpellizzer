                            <h1>Betula Bhojpattra Var. Genuina</h1>
<p>Betula bhojpattra var. genuina is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Himalayan regions of India. Known for its unique leaf morphology and medicinal properties, it has been revered in traditional Ayurvedic practices for centuries. This variant of the birch tree is distinguished by its lance-shaped leaves and ability to thrive in high altitude environments. Despite its ecological and cultural significance, it remains under-studied and endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting. Protecting this plant is crucial for preserving both biodiversity and indigenous knowledge systems.</p>
