<p>Botryopteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and supports the growth of its branching, spore-producing structures. Botryopteris mexicana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are often clustered in spore sacs, which are dispersed by water currents.</p>
