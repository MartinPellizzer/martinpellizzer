                    <h1>Buxus revoluta</h1>
<p>Buxus revoluta, commonly known as the silver-leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, glossy dark green leaves that are slightly revolute, or curled under. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and topiary.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to maintain shape with regular pruning.</p>
