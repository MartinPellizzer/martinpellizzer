                    <h1>Biophytum sensitivum var. nervifolium</h1>
<p>Biophytum sensitivum var. nervifolium, commonly known as the sensitive plant or "touch-me-not," is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that rapidly fold and curl when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique behavior.</p>
