                    <h1>Bastardia conferta</h1>
<p>Bastardia conferta, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with slender, thread-like stems that help it float.</p>
<p>Bastardia conferta is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival.</p>
