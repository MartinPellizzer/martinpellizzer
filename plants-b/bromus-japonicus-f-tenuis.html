                    <h1>Bromus japonicus f. tenuis</h1>
<p>Bromus japonicus f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, pale green or brown spikelets. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a rough texture, which helps distinguish it from other brome species.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
