                    <h1>Benzingia palorae</h1>
<p>Benzingia palorae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which provide it with essential nutrients due to its lack of chlorophyll. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it is often found growing on the bases of mangrove trees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Benzingia palorae is considered critically endangered.</p>
