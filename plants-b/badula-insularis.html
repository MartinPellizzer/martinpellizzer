<p>Badula insularis, commonly known as the island badula, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Badula insularis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
