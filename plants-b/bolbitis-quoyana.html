<p>Bolbitis quoyana, commonly known as the Quoy's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes form a dense network beneath the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Bolbitis quoyana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
