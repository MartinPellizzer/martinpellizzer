                            <h1>Bidens Coccinea</h1>
<p>Bidens coccinea, commonly known as the red stem beggarticks, is a vibrant annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is easily recognized by its bright red stems and yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. While it is considered a weed by some, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and wildlife. Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
