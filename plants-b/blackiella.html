                    <h1>Blackiella</h1>
<p>Blackiella, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that contain the seeds. Blackiella thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense thickets in tidal areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
