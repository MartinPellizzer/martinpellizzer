                    <h1>Billbergia amoena var. typica</h1>
<p>Billbergia amoena var. typica, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in ornamental gardening due to its long-lasting floral display and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
