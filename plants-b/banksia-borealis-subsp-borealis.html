<p>Banksia borealis subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the southern banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces woody cones that contain hard, ribbed seeds, which are adapted for release during fires. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation.</p>
