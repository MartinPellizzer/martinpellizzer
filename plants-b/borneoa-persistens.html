                <h1>Borneoa persistens</h1>
<p>Borneoa persistens, commonly known as the persistent bear tree, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stem and broad, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Borneoa persistens is also notable for its ability to shed leaves seasonally, a rare trait among tropical rainforest plants.</p>
