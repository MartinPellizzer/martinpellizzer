<p>Brachyderea tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, delicate flower that can range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
