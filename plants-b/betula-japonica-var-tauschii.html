                    <h1>Betula japonica var. tauschii</h1>
<p>Betula japonica var. tauschii, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic bark and seasonal changes.</p>
