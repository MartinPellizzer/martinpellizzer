<p>Bulbophyllum foetidilabrum, commonly known as the stinking labellum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often fragrant or foul-smelling labellum, which plays a role in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
