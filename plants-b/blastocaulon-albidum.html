                    <h1>Blastocaulon albidum</h1>
<p>Blastocaulon albidum, commonly known as the white blister lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a pale, leathery thallus with a distinctive white or pale yellowish color.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its irregularly shaped, lobed lobes that often have a blistery appearance due to the presence of small, rounded pores. The lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on bark or soil in temperate regions. It is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
