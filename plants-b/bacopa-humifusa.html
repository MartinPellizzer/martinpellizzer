<p>Bacopa humifusa, commonly known as inchplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are usually less than an inch in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens.</p>
