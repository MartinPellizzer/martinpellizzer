<p>Biscutella laevigata proles pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
