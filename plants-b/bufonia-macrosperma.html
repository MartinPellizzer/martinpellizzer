                    <h1>Bufonia macrosperma</h1>
<p>Bufonia macrosperma, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a large, non-toxic fungal plant that belongs to the family Lepiota.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, spongy cap that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a dense, cotton-like texture. The fruiting body typically appears in late summer and early autumn, often in grassy areas or near decaying organic matter. It lacks a distinct stem and has a smooth, rounded surface that becomes darker as it matures.</p>
<p>While not poisonous, it is often confused with toxic look-alikes, so caution is advised when identifying it in the wild.</p>
