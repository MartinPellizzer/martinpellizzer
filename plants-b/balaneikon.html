                    <h1>Balaneikon</h1>
<p>Balaneikon, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by oval, berry-like fruits. Balaneikon is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
