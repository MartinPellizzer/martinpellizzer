                    <h1>Botrychium lunarioides var. daedaleum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunarioides var. daedaleum, commonly known as the veined moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with a cluster of fertile fronds that bear spore-bearing structures called sorus. Its leaves are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinctive veining pattern and its role in forest ecosystems as an indicator of undisturbed habitats.</p>
