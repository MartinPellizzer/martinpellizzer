                    <h1>Brachystegia klainei</h1>
<p>Brachystegia klainei, commonly known as the African brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
