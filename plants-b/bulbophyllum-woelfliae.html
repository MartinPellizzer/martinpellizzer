                    <h1>Bulbophyllum woelfliae</h1>

<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and fleshy, adapted to maximize moisture absorption.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique floral structure.</p>
