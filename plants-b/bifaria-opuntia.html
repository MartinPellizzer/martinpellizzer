<p>Bifaria opuntia, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Bifaria opuntia is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
