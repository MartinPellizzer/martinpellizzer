<p>Baeckea ramosissima subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate baeckea, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often rooting at the nodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
