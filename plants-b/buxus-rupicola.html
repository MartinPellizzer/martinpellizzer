                    <h1>Buxus rupicola</h1>
<p>Buxus rupicola, commonly known as the rock boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant.</p>
