<p>Blechnum cycadoides, commonly known as the cycad-like fern, is a unique plant species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that resemble those of cycads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Blechnum cycadoides is notable for its primitive features and is considered a relict species with historical significance in New Zealand's flora.</p>
