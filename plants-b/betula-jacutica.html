                    <h1>Betula jacutica</h1>
<p>Betula jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in mountainous regions and boreal forests.</p>
