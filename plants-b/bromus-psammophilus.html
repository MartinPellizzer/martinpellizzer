                    <h1>Bromus psammophilus</h1>
<p>Bromus psammophilus, commonly known as the sandy bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to sandy soils with poor nutrient content. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Bromus psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
