                    <h1>Betula mongolica</h1>
<p>Betula mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white or silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
