                    <h1>Balanophora thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Balanophora thwaitesii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are specialized for attachment to host trees, and it is often found growing epiphytically on the trunks of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
