<p>Botrychium acuminatum, commonly known as the acuminated moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Botrychium acuminatum is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often associated with calcareous soils.</p>
