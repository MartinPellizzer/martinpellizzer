                    <h1>Brachystelma pruinosum</h1>
<p>Brachystelma pruinosum, commonly known as the silver starling cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces white to pink flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a thick, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Brachystelma pruinosum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
