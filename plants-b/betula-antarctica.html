                    <h1>Betula antarctica</h1>
<p>Betula antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic birch, is a small, shrub-like tree native to the cold regions of Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its bark is smooth and often white or pale gray, resembling that of other birch species.</p>
<p>Betula antarctica plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various Antarctic invertebrates.</p>
