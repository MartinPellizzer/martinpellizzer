                    <h1>Betula alba var. typica</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. typica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Betula alba var. typica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance.</p>
