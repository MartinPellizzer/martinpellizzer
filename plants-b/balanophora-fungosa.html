                    <h1>Balanophora fungosa</h1>
<p>Balanophora fungosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it entirely reliant on its host for nutrients, as it cannot perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive appearance, often resembling a ghostly figure. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Florida, where it thrives in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
