                    <h1>Breviglandium</h1>
<p>Breviglandium, commonly known as the small-lobed bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in their nutrient absorption. Breviglandium species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They have delicate, leafy stems with whorled leaves that often bear small, specialized bladders.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its carnivorous adaptations, which complement its photosynthetic capabilities in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
