                    <h1>Buxus calophylla</h1>
<p>Buxus calophylla, commonly known as the glossy boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is highly glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for horticultural use.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in formal garden designs and topiary.</p>
