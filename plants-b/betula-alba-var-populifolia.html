                    <h1>Betula alba var. populifolia</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. populifolia, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a serrated margin and a prominent midrib, resembling those of poplars. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
