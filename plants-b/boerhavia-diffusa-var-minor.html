                    <h1>Boerhavia diffusa var. minor</h1>
<p>Boerhavia diffusa var. minor, commonly known as spreading hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pale green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, riverbanks, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
