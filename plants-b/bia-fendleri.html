                    <h1>Bia fendleri</h1>
<p>Bia fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican firebush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bright red to orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Bia fendleri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions make it a popular ornamental plant in desert gardens.</p>
