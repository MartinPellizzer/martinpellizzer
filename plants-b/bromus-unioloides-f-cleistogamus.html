                    <h1>Bromus unioloides f. cleistogamus</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides f. cleistogamus, commonly known as the cleistogamous brome, is a botanical variant of the common brome grass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its production of cleistogamous flowers, which are closed, self-pollinating blooms that do not open. This trait allows the plant to reproduce efficiently in shaded or disturbed environments where pollinators may be less abundant. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation strategies and role in ecological succession.</p>
