                    <h1>Botrychium dissectum var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium dissectum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is often associated with specific soil types and can be an indicator of undisturbed, mature habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
