                    <h1>Bouteloua nana</h1>
<p>Bouteloua nana, commonly known as dwarf grama, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, forming dense, clumping foliage that is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest in late spring to early summer. Its fine, silver-gray leaves are highly ornamental and make it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Bouteloua nana is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
