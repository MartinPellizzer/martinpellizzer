                    <h1>Beloperone sanmartensis</h1>
<p>Beloperone sanmartensis, commonly known as the San Mart√≠n's beloperone, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Beloperone sanmartensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
