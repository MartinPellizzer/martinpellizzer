                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pandanetorum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pandanetorum, commonly known as the pandanus orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves that resemble those of the pandanus plant, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
