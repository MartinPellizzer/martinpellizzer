                    <h1>Berberis sinensis var. cretica</h1>
<p>Berberis sinensis var. cretica, commonly known as the Crete barberry, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, as it contains berberine, a compound with potential health benefits.</p>
