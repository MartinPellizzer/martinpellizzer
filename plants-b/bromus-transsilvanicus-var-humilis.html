                    <h1>Bromus transsilvanicus var. humilis</h1>
<p>Bromus transsilvanicus var. humilis, commonly known as the Transylvanian bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in shaded or partially sunny environments.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
