                    <h1>Barkania bullata</h1>
<p>Barkania bullata, commonly known as the smooth bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, smooth, and often whitish to pale yellowish thallus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery texture and the absence of distinct lobes, which sets it apart from other similar lichens. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forested areas where it can receive adequate moisture and light.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Barkania bullata is an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions.</p>
