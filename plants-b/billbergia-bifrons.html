<p>Billbergia bifrons, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Billbergia bifrons thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>
