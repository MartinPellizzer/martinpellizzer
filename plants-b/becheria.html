                    <h1>Becheria</h1>
<p>Becheria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Becheria has small, scale-like leaves and produces a unique, fragrant bloom that is often short-lived.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
