                    <h1>Bromus × hannoverianus</h1>
<p>Bromus × hannoverianus, commonly known as the Hamburg grass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Bromus rigidus and Bromus inermis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem, with the lower spikelet being shorter and the upper one longer. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-green color, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Bromus × hannoverianus is an invasive species in many regions, capable of outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
