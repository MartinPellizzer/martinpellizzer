<p>Bolandra imnahaensis, commonly known as the Tuluva sandalwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a slow growth rate, making it vulnerable to deforestation and habitat loss. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Bolandra imnahaensis is considered a conservation priority.</p>
