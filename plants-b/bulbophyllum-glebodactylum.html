                    <h1>Bulbophyllum glebodactylum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum glebodactylum, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which contribute to its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the rocky substrates it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
