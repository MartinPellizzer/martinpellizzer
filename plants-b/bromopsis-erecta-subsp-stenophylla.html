<p>Bromopsis erecta subsp.</p>
<p>stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture and turfgrass mixtures.</p>
