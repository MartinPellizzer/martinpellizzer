                    <h1>Begonia sanjeensis</h1>
<p>Begonia sanjeensis, commonly known as the Sanje begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude rainforests of western Uganda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
