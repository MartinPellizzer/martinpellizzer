                            <h1>Boechera Spatifolia</h1>
<p>Rocky mountain rockcress, scientifically known as Boechera spatifolia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. This member of the Brassicaceae family is often found in rocky soils and high elevation habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Despite its small size, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability. Its unique appearance, with narrow leaves and small white flowers, makes it a striking addition to mountain flora. Due to habitat loss and climate change, the species faces increasing threats, making conservation efforts vital for its survival.</p>
