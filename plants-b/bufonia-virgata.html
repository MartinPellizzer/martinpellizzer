<p>Bufonia virgata, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like structure and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces and soil in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Bufonia virgata plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
