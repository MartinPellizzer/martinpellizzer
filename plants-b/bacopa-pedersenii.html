                    <h1>Bacopa pedersenii</h1>
<p>Bacopa pedersenii, commonly known as the coastal bacopa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, opposite leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Flowers are usually blue to violet in color, clustered in pairs, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
