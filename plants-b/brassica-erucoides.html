<p>Brassica erucoides, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It produces small yellow or white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of long, slender pods containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Brassica erucoides is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts.</p>
