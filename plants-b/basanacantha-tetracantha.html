                    <h1>Basanacantha tetracantha</h1>
<p>Basanacantha tetracantha, commonly known as the four-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its spiny stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Basanacantha tetracantha is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds.</p>
