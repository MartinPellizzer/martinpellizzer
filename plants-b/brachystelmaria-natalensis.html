<p>Brachystelmaria natalensis, commonly known as Natal's short-stemmed orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, preferring a sunny to partially shaded environment. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle violet hue. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, well-drained substrates it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
