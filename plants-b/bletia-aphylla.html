                    <h1>Bletia aphylla</h1>
<p>Bletia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its showy, often fragrant flowers for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Bletia aphylla thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
