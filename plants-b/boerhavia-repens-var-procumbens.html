                    <h1>Boerhavia repens var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Boerhavia repens var. procumbens, commonly known as spreading horsebean, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, triangular seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
