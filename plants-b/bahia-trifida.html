                    <h1>Bahia trifida</h1>
<p>Bahia trifida, commonly known as Florida panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
