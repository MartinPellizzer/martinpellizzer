                    <h1>Bourreria nemoralis</h1>
<p>Bourreria nemoralis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host, often grasses or other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host but is not typically harmful to the ecosystem in moderate quantities.</p>
