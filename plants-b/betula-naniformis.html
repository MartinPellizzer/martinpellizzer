                    <h1>Betula naniformis</h1>
<p>Betula naniformis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub-like tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin strips. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, making it a common component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
