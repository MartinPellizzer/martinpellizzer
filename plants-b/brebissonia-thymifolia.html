                    <h1>Brebissonia thymifolia</h1>
<p>Brebissonia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved brebissonia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Brebissonia thymifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
