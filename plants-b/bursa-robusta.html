                    <h1>Bursa robusta</h1>
<p>Bursa robusta, commonly known as the giant burr plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny burrs. These burrs are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Bursa robusta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
