<p>Braya limoselloides, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky slopes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
