                    <h1>Berberis pruinosa var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Berberis pruinosa var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, thorny stems covered in a whitish, waxy bloom that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. Its foliage consists of small, oval leaves that are dark green and have a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
