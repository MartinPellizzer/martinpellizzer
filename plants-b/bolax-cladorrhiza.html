                    <h1>Bolax cladorrhiza</h1>
<p>Bolax cladorrhiza, commonly known as the hairy bolax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each stem. Its fibrous root system is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Bolax cladorrhiza is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
