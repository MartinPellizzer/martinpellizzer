                    <h1>Berula erecta f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Berula erecta f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf water plantain, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in moist soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
