<p>Betula utilis, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale green and yellow beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular nuts. It thrives in cold climates and is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Betula utilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens around the world.</p>
