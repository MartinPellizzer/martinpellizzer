<p>Banisteriopsis martiniana var. subenervia, commonly known as the Amazonian arrow poison.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine native to the rainforests of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with a distinctive sub-veined pattern. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids in its sap, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting purposes.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and chemical composition make it a subject of interest in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological research.</p>
