<p>Basanacantha spinifex, commonly known as the spiny thornplant, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically small and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often adorned with spines for protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Basanacantha spinifex is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
