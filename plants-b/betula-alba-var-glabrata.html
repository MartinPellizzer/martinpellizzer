                    <h1>Betula alba var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its smooth, pale bark that lacks the flaky texture of the typical white birch.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn gold in autumn. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
