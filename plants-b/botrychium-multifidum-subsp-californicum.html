<p>Botrychium multifidum subsp.</p>
<p>californicum, commonly known as the California moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
