                    <h1>Barringtonia revoluta</h1>
<p>Barringtonia revoluta, commonly known as the white mangosteen or candle bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-shaped inflorescences that hang from the branches. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a rough, green, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, palmate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
