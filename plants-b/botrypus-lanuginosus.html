<p>Botrypus lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a soft, downy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrypus lanuginosus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
