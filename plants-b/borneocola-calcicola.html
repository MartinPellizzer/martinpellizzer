                    <h1>Borneocola calcicola</h1>
<p>Borneocola calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the limestone regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Borneocola calcicola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations to limestone environments make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
