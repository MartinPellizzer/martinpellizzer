                    <h1>Brachystelma schoenlandianum</h1>
<p>Brachystelma schoenlandianum, commonly known as the Schoenland's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
