                    <h1>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. planiculmis</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
