The plant features a thick, leathery frond that resembles a staghorn, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous media for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
