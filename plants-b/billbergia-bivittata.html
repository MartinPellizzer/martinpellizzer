                    <h1>Billbergia bivittata</h1>
<p>Billbergia bivittata, commonly known as the two-striped billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, with a central tank that collects water. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding dramatic visual appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia bivittata is a popular choice for indoor gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
