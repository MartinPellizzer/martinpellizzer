<p>Blechnum magellanicum var. cycadifolium, commonly known as the Magellanic water fern, is a variant of the genus Blechnum native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fern-like fronds that resemble the structure of cycads, giving it its specific epithet "cycadifolium.". The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, supporting the growth of its delicate, segmented fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
