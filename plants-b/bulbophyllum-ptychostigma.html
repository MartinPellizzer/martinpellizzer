                    <h1>Bulbophyllum ptychostigma</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum ptychostigma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate, spurred petals that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
