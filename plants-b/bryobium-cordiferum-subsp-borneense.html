<p>Bryobium cordiferum subsp.</p>
<p>borneense, commonly known as the Bornean heartleaf bryobium, is a unique member of the family Hypnaceae. It is a small, evergreen moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are often curled and have a leathery texture. It exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct cellular differentiation, which is typical of mosses in the genus Bryobium.</p>
<p>This subspecies is endemic to Borneo and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
