<p>Biarum tenuifolium subsp.</p>
<p>zelebori, commonly known as the slender-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a rare and striking member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color.</p>
<p>Native to the southeastern United States, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its flowers emit a strong, musty odor to attract specific pollinators, such as flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
