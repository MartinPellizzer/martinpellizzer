<p>Buesia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, spherical fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Buesia is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
