                    <h1>Bromus muralis</h1>
<p>Bromus muralis, commonly known as the wall brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in walls, cracks in stone, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily.</p>
<p>Bromus muralis is adapted to dry, harsh environments and is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
