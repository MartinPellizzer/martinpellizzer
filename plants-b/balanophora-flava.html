                    <h1>Balanophora flava</h1>
<p>Balanophora flava, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the host, and it has a short, stocky body with reduced leaves.</p>
<p>Balanophora flava is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, contributing to the complex interactions within tropical ecosystems.</p>
