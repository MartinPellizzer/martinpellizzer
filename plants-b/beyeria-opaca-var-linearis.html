<p>Beyeria opaca var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
