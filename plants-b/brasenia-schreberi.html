                    <h1>Brasenia schreberi</h1>
<p>Brasenia schreberi, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has broad, rounded leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the plant in shallow water.</p>
<p>Brasenia schreberi is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
