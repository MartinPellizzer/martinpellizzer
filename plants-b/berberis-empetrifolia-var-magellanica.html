                    <h1>Berberis empetrifolia var. magellanica</h1>
<p>Berberis empetrifolia var. magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan barberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates.</p>
