<p>Bouteloua elata, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually distinct from other grasses. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Silver bluestem is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its spread across grassland ecosystems.</p>
