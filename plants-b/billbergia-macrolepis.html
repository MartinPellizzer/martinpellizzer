                    <h1>Billbergia macrolepis</h1>
<p>Billbergia macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which can grow up to 2 meters in height, with long, narrow, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia macrolepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
