                    <h1>Balanites aegyptiaca var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Balanites aegyptiaca var. microphylla, commonly known as the little leaf date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that contain a single large seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appearance and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
