                    <h1>Bulbophyllum formosanum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, often in shades of yellow and red, which are arranged in a spiral pattern on the inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by horticulturists, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
