<p>Biserrula, commonly known as biserrula oxyphylla, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is often used as a forage crop and in erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Biserrula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid environments.</p>
