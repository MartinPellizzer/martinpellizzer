<p>Biarum carduchorum, commonly known as the Carduchorum bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, azure-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Biarum carduchorum is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
