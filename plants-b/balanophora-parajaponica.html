                    <h1>Balanophora parajaponica</h1>
<p>Balanophora parajaponica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its root system is highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
