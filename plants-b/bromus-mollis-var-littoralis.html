                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
