<p>Bicornella henrici, commonly known as the Henry's two-horned plant, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its distinctive two-horned calyx at the base of its flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
