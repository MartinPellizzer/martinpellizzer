<p>Bokkeveldia watermeyeri subsp.</p>
<p>botterkloofensis, commonly known as the Botterkloof lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it is often found growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
