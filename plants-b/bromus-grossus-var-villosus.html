                    <h1>Bromus grossus var. villosus</h1>
<p>Bromus grossus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically awnless or with short awns, and its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed.</p>
