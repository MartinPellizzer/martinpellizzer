                    <h1>Bradburya bracteosa</h1>
<p>Bradburya bracteosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal beauty. Bradburya bracteosa is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
