<p>Betula procurva subsp.</p>
<p>schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology.</p>
