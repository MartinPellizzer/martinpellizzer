                    <h1>Banksia barbigera</h1>
<p>Banksia barbigera, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles open. Banksia barbigera is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with a lignotuber that allows it to resprout after bushfires.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure supports a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects.</p>
