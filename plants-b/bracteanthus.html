                    <h1>Bracteanthus</h1>
<p>Bracteanthus, commonly known as the "false arum," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped bracts that resemble the leaves of true arums, though they are not true leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Bracteanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique foliage.</p>
