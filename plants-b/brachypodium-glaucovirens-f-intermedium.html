<p>Brachypodium glaucovirens f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate glaucovirens bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves with a bluish sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research.</p>
