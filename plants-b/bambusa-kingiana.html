                    <h1>Bambusa kingiana</h1>
<p>Bambusa kingiana, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, golden-yellow culms that are often used in construction and crafts due to their strength and flexibility. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are robust and help the plant spread through clumping growth.</p>
<p>Bambusa kingiana is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
