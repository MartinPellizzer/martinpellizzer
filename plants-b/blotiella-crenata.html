<p>Blotiella crenata, commonly known as the crested bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Blotiella crenata is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
