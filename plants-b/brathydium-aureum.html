                    <h1>Brathydium aureum</h1>
<p>Brathydium aureum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like arrangement of leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant's leaves are typically bright green and covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells that help retain moisture. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found on rocks or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats.</p>
