                    <h1>Bromus coloratus var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Bromus coloratus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. One notable botanical feature is its viviparous nature, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait aids in its dispersal and survival in arid environments.</p>
