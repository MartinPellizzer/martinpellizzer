                    <h1>Balanophora fargesii</h1>
<p>Balanophora fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese ghost flower, is a rare and unusual parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem with a fleshy, often reddish root system, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is typically found growing on the roots of other plants, such as trees and shrubs, in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
