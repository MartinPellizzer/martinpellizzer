                    <h1>Berberis moritzii</h1>
<p>Berberis moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It features thick, ridged, and often spiny stems that are covered in a dense layer of pale yellow to orange bark. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Berberis moritzii is valued in horticulture for its hardy nature and striking winter foliage.</p>
