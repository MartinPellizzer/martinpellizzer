                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pertenue</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pertenue, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin stems and clusters of white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat on trees or rocks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a popular but challenging plant for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
