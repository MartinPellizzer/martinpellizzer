                    <h1>Butia capitata var. rubra</h1>
<p>Butia capitata var. rubra, commonly known as the red palm tree, is a striking variety of the bottle palm native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or pinkish hues on the leaf stems, which contrast with its green fronds. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that yield edible fruits, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other palm species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
