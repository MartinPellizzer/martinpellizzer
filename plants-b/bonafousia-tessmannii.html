                    <h1>Bonafousia tessmannii</h1>
<p>Bonafousia tessmannii, commonly known as the African mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bonafousia tessmannii is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
