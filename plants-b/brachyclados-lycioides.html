                    <h1>Brachyclados lycioides</h1>
<p>Brachyclados lycioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
