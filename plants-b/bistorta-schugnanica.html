<p>Bistorta schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
