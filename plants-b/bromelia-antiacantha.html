<p>Bromelia antiacantha, commonly known as the spiny bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant features sharp, spiny margins on its leaves, which provide a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Bromelia antiacantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
