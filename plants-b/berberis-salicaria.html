<p>Berberis salicaria, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a waxy texture with a slight serration along the edges.</p>
