                    <h1>Begonia scitifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia scitifolia, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated in horticulture.</p>
