<p>Balsamus libanotus, commonly known as the Frankincense tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, aromatic resin that has been used for centuries in incense, medicine, and religious ceremonies. The plant has a dense, bushy crown with small, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its resin, known as frankincense, is obtained through the controlled harvesting of sap from the tree's bark.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Balsamus libanotus make it a valuable species in both traditional and modern applications.</p>
