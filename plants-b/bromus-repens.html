                    <h1>Bromus repens</h1>
<p>Bromus repens, commonly known as the prostrate brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, leafless stems that lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and open fields.</p>
<p>Bromus repens is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ability to colonize poor soils.</p>
