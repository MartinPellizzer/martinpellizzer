                    <h1>Botrychium australe</h1>
<p>Botrychium australe, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that resemble a crown, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a single row along the stem. Botrychium australe is native to Australia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern evolution and ecological adaptation.</p>
