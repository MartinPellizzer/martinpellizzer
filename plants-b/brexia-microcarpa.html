<p>Brexia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Brexia microcarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
