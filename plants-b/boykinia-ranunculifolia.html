<p>Boykinia ranunculifolia, commonly known as the rock scilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually basal, while the flowering stems are usually shorter than the foliage.</p>
<p>Boykinia ranunculifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult, rocky environments.</p>
