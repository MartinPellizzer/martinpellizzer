<p>Bicornella similis, commonly known as the two-horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually small and whorled, with specialized structures for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Bicornella similis is an example of a carnivorous plant that has adapted to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
