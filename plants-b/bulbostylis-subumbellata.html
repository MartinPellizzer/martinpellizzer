                    <h1>Bulbostylis subumbellata</h1>
<p>Bulbostylis subumbellata, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in conservation areas and is a valuable indicator species for wetland health.</p>
