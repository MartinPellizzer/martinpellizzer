                    <h1>Brachycorythis helferi</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis helferi, commonly known as the Helferi's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
