<p>Buxus brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically no more than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and compact form, it is often used in topiary and hedge planting.</p>
