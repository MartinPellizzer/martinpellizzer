<p>Bulbophyllum maximum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow and green, making it a striking addition to botanical collections.</p>
