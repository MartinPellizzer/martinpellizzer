                    <h1>Berberis × helenae var. heterantha</h1>
<p>Berberis × helenae var. heterantha, commonly known as the hybrid barberry, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of berberine. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy texture and turn reddish in autumn.</p>
