<p>Brassica repanda subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum mustard, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often on gypsum or saline substrates, which are challenging environments for most plants. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
