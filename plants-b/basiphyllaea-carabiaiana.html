                    <h1>Basiphyllaea carabiaiana</h1>
<p>Basiphyllaea carabiaiana, commonly known as the Carabia rock orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats at high elevations. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
