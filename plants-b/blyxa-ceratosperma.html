<p>Blyxa ceratosperma, commonly known as the spiked watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes.
