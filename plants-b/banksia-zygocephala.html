                    <h1>Banksia zygocephala</h1>
<p>Banksia zygocephala, commonly known as the zigzag banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag arrangement of its woody stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters known as "heads" during the spring and summer months. These flowers are pollinated by nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important species for local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians.</p>
