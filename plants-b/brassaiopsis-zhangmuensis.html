<p>Brassaiopsis zhangmuensis, commonly known as the Zhangmu bracken, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brassaiopsis zhangmuensis is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
