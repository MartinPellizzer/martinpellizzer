                    <h1>Breynia obscura</h1>
<p>Breynia obscura, commonly known as the dark breynia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Breynia obscura is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>
