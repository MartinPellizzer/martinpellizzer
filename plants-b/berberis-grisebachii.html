                    <h1>Berberis grisebachii</h1>
<p>Berberis grisebachii, commonly known as the Kashmiri barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins, typical of the Berberis genus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil.</p>
