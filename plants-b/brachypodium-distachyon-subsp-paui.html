<p>Brachypodium distachyon subsp.</p>
<p>paui, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle, it is widely used in plant research for studying genome structure and function.</p>
