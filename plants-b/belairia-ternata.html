                    <h1>Belairia ternata</h1>
<p>Belairia ternata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Belairia ternata is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
