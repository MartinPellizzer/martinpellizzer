<p>Brachiaria mollis, commonly known as silky grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in pastures, lawns, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Brachiaria mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
