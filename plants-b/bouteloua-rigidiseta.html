<p>Bouteloua rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects.</p>
