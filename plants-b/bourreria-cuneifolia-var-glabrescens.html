                    <h1>Bourreria cuneifolia var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Bourreria cuneifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf burrseria, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens has a smoother, hairless surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies in arid environments.</p>
