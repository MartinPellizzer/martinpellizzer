                    <h1>Blakwellia dasyantha</h1>
<p>Blakwellia dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and provide camouflage. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged.</p>
<p>Blakwellia dasyantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
