                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens var. myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly waxy texture, and its leaves are broader and more elongated compared to typical boxwood varieties. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-brown berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its neat growth habit and ability to maintain shape with regular pruning.</p>
