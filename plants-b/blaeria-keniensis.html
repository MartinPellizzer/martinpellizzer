                    <h1>Blaeria keniensis</h1>
<p>Blaeria keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Kenya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that trap insects. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, using its specialized structures to capture and digest prey.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
