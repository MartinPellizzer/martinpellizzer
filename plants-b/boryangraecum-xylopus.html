<p>Boryangraecum xylopus, commonly known as the Cape fynbos lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.
