<p>Barbacenia bibiriensis, commonly known as the Bibiri bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Barbacenia bibiriensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
