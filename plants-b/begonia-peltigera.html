                    <h1>Begonia peltigera</h1>
<p>Begonia peltigera, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated for both decorative and horticultural purposes.</p>
