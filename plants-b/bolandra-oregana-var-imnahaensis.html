                    <h1>Bolandra oregana var. imnahaensis</h1>
<p>Bolandra oregana var. imnahaensis, commonly known as the Imnaha valley bitterroot, is a variant of the bitterroot plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its historical significance to Indigenous communities.</p>
