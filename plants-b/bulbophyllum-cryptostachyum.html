                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cryptostachyum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cryptostachyum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks a visible above-ground stem and relies on its roots to anchor itself to trees or other substrates. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
