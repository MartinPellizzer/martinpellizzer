                    <h1>Betula nana</h1>
<p>Betula nana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small, shrub-like tree native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded crown, smooth gray bark, and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Betula nana thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-latitude plant communities.</p>
