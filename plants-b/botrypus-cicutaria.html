<p>Botrypus cicutaria, commonly known as water starwort, is a member of the water fern family (Ceratopteris).</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Botrypus cicutaria is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality.</p>
