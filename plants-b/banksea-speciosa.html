                    <h1>Banksea speciosa</h1>
<p>Banksea speciosa, commonly known as the showy banksea, is a striking coastal plant native to the western regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Banksea speciosa plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
