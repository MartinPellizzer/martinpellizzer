                    <h1>Betula dalecarlica</h1>
<p>Betula dalecarlica, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Betula dalecarlica thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
