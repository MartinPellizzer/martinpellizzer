                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf brome, is a compact grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to less than 30 cm in height, and its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological studies due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued in agricultural research for its potential as a model organism for studying grasses.</p>
