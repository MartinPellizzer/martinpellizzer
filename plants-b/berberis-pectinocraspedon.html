                    <h1>Berberis pectinocraspedon</h1>
<p>Berberis pectinocraspedon, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds in high quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy fruit, though care must be taken due to its potential toxicity.</p>
