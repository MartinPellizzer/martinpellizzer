<p>Brachythalamus, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in dry, rocky soils. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The genus includes several species, such as Brachythalamus lanuginosus, which is native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage.</p>
