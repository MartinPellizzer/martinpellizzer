                    <h1>Billbergia distachya var. concolor</h1>
<p>Billbergia distachya var. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf billbergia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue with white or silver markings. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright red bracts that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
