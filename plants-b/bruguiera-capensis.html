<p>Bruguiera capensis, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Bruguiera capensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
