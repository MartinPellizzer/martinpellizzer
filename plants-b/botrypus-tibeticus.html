                    <h1>Botrypus tibeticus</h1>
<p>Botrypus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a dense, mat-like structure on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant's rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread across water bodies and anchor itself in muddy substrates. Botrypus tibeticus thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine lakes and mountain streams.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of high-altitude aquatic ecosystems.</p>
