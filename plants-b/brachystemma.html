                    <h1>Brachystemma</h1>
<p>Brachystemma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms that appear above the soil surface. The plants typically have a short, fleshy stem with a single flower at the top, which opens only briefly during the day. Brachystemma species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to their short blooming period and rare occurrence, they are considered rare and are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
