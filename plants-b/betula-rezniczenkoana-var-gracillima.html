<p>Betula rezniczenkoana var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and finely toothed, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its bark is smooth and pale, often developing fissures with age.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, moist environments and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
