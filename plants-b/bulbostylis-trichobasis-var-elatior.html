<p>Bulbostylis trichobasis var. elatior, commonly known as the tall slender bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in association with water or in seasonally flooded areas. Its bulbous base serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought or seasonal changes.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually inconspicuous, with tiny, greenish-white florets that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
