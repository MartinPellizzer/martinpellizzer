<p>Blyxa echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-fruited water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by water currents. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Blyxa echinosperma is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
