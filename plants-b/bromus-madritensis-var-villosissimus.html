                    <h1>Bromus madritensis var. villosissimus</h1>
<p>Bromus madritensis var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with each spikelet containing several small, two-rowed flowers. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and forest edges, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain environments.</p>
