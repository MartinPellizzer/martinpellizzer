<p>Byttneria arguta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
