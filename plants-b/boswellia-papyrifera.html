                    <h1>Boswellia papyrifera</h1>
<p>Boswellia papyrifera, commonly known as frankincense or olibanum, is a small, deciduous tree native to the dry regions of the Arabian Peninsula and northeastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow bark and small, inconspicuous green leaves. The plant produces aromatic resin, which is harvested from the bark and used in incense, medicine, and perfumery. It thrives in arid climates and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Boswellia papyrifera plays an important role in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
