                    <h1>Benkara sinensis</h1>
<p>Benkara sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing dark brown seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth surface with a strong, spicy scent.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Benkara sinensis is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
