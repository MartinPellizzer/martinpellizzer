<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Blechnum auriculatum, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) shape at the base of the pinnae.
