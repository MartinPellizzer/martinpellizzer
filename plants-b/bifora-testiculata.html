<p>Bifora testiculata, commonly known as the testicle plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits that resemble small testes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in green bracts, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to livestock.</p>
<p>Bifora testiculata is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties.</p>
