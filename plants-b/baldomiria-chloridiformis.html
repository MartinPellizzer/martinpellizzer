                    <h1>Baldomiria chloridiformis</h1>
<p>Baldomiria chloridiformis, commonly known as the yellow sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit with small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. It is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
