                    <h1>Betula rupestris</h1>
<p>Betula rupestris, commonly known as the rock birch, is a small, hardy deciduous tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, papery leaves that turn golden in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and white, with a tendency to peel in thin layers.</p>
<p>Betula rupestris is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
