                    <h1>Bornmuellerantha</h1>
<p>Bornmuellerantha, commonly known as the "Ghost Orchid," is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Bornmuellerantha faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
