                    <h1>Bigelovia umbellata</h1>
<p>Bigelovia umbellata, commonly known as the desert umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat cluster. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bigelovia umbellata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
