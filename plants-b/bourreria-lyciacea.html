<p>Bourreria lyciacea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its fibrous, woody stems are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their purported healing properties.</p>
