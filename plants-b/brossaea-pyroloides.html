                    <h1>Brossaea pyroloides</h1>
<p>Brossaea pyroloides, commonly known as the flameless brossea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the base of the plant. Brossaea pyroloides thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
