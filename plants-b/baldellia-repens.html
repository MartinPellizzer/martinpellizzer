<p>Baldellia repens, commonly known as the creeping waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it an important species in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Baldellia repens plays a role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
