                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pauwelsianum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pauwelsianum, commonly known as the Pauwels' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to form pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
