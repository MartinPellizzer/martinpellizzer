<p>Bifaria crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf burrweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds. Bifaria crassa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an adaptable species with potential uses in ecological restoration projects.</p>
