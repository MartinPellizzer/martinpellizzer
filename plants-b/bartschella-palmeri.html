<p>Bartschella palmeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert scrub habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are followed by small, oval seed pods that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Bartschella palmeri is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments with minimal water availability.</p>
