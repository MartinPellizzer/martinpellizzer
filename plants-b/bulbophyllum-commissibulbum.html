<p>Bulbophyllum commissibulbum, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild.</p>
