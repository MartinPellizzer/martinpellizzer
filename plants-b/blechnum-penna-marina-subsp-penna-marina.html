<p>Blechnum penna-marina subsp.</p>
<p>penna-marina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a feather, with a silvery sheen on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a feature that aids in its identification and ecological interactions.</p>
