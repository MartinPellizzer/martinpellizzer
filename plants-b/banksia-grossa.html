                    <h1>Banksia grossa</h1>
<p>Banksia grossa, commonly known as the large banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are released after a fire, a key adaptation for survival in its fire-prone habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and rigid, often covered in fine hairs, and it can grow up to 10 meters tall.</p>
<p>Banksia grossa is an important component of the local flora and plays a vital role in supporting native wildlife.</p>
