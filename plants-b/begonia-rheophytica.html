                    <h1>Begonia rheophytica</h1>
<p>Begonia rheophytica, commonly known as the water begonia, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its unique ability to thrive in moist, rocky environments makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
