                    <h1>Bermudiana bermudiana var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Bermudiana bermudiana var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the Bermuda grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is highly drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is also known for its ability to spread through both rhizomes and stolons, forming a thick, resilient turf.</p>
