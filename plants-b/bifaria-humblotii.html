<p>Bifaria humblotii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a dark central stripe. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifaria humblotii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
