<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
