                    <h1>Botrychium virginianum var. occidentale</h1>
<p>Botrychium virginianum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a fern native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern with a unique morphology, featuring a single, upright sterile frond and a separate, often curled fertile frond. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fertile frond, which is often rolled into a tight spiral.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Botrychium genus, characterized by its specialized reproductive structures and ecological adaptations.</p>
