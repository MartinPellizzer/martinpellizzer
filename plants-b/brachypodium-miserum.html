<p>Brachypodium miserum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a small annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
