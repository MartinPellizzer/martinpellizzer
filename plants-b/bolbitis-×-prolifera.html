                    <h1>Bolbitis × prolifera</h1>
<p>Bolbitis × prolifera, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Bolbitis heterophylla and Bolbitis cuneifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns.

<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
