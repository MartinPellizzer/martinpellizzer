<p>Behen vulgaris, commonly known as castor bean, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. The seeds are rich in oil, which is widely used in industrial and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of ricin, the plant is considered highly poisonous and requires careful handling.</p>
