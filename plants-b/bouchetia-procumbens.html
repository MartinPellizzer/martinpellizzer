<p>Bouchetia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bouchetia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for erosion control in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Bouchetia procumbens is often found in shaded, woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>
