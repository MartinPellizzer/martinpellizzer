<p>Bryodesma shakotanense, commonly known as the Shakotan moss, is a rare and unique species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green to reddish-brown coloration, which varies with environmental conditions. This moss is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices and forest floors, where it thrives in humid climates. Its small, leafy structures are arranged in dense tufts, and it reproduces through spores released from specialized capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bryodesma shakotanense is considered an important indicator species for studying ecological changes in its native range.</p>
