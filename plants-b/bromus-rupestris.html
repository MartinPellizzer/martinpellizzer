                    <h1>Bromus rupestris</h1>
<p>Bromus rupestris, commonly known as the rock brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Bromus rupestris is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
