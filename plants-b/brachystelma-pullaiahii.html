                    <h1>Brachystelma pullaiahii</h1>
<p>Brachystelma pullaiahii, commonly known as the Kurnell rock fig, is a rare and endemic species found in the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, succulent shrub with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
