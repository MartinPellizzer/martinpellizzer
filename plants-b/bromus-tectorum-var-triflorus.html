<p>Bromus tectorum var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces three to five spikelets per branch, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to brownish flowers that appear in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and seed production make it an invasive species in many ecosystems.</p>
