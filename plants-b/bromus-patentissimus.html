                    <h1>Bromus patentissimus</h1>
<p>Bromus patentissimus, commonly known as the Patagonian brome, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its habitat. Bromus patentissimus thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme environmental conditions makes it an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
