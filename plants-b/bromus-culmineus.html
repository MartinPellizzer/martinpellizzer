                    <h1>Bromus culmineus</h1>
<p>Bromus culmineus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Bromus culmineus is adapted to cold climates and is often an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
