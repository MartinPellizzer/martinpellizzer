                    <h1>Bromus squarrosus var. dasystachys</h1>
<p>Bromus squarrosus var. dasystachys, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, panicle-like structures, which are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in arid environments.</p>
