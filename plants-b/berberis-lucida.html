                    <h1>Berberis lucida</h1>
<p>Berberis lucida, commonly known as the shining barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and as a hedge.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact growth habit.</p>
