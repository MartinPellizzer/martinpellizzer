                    <h1>Baccharis baldwinii</h1>
<p>Baccharis baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as plains and rocky hillsides. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, white to yellowish flower clusters in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
