<p>Beloperone macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered beloperone, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent red or orange throat. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration.</p>
