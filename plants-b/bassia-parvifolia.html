                    <h1>Bassia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Bassia parvifolia, commonly known as dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
