                    <h1>Bolbitis pellucens</h1>
<p>Bolbitis pellucens, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, which help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
