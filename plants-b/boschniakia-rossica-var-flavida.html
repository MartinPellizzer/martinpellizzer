                    <h1>Boschniakia rossica var. flavida</h1>
<p>Boschniakia rossica var. flavida, commonly known as the golden boschniakia, is a rare and striking parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and specialized roots that attach to host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
