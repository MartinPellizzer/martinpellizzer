<p>Botrychium alaskense var. alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like structure called a sorus, which is a key feature of the genus Botrychium.</p>
<p>The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
