                    <h1>Betula verrucosa var. pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Betula verrucosa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive conical shape and smooth, white bark.</p>
<p>It is native to the northern regions of North America and thrives in cold climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, is a key identifying feature and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
<p>This deciduous tree is often found in boreal forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
