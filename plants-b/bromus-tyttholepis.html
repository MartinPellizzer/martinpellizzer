<p>Bromus tyttholepis, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are rough and hairy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Bromus tyttholepis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
