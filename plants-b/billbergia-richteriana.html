                    <h1>Billbergia richteriana</h1>
<p>Billbergia richteriana, commonly known as the Rainbow Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
