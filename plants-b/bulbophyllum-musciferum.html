                    <h1>Bulbophyllum musciferum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum musciferum, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to form a dense mat of leaf-like structures that resemble moss, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical rainforests and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
