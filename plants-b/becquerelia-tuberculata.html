<p>Becquerelia tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate becquerella, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tuberculate (knob-like) leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. Native to specific regions in South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
