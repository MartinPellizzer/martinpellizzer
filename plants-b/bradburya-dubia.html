<p>Bradburya dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or pine flatwoods. The plant features a single, slender stem with a cluster of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and limited range, Bradburya dubia is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
