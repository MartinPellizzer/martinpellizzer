                    <h1>Bermudiana bermudiana var. iridifolia</h1>
<p>Bermudiana bermudiana var. iridifolia, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, low-growing habit that forms a thick sod. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread through stolons and rhizomes allows it to form extensive mats, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance.</p>
