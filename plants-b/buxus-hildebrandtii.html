                    <h1>Buxus hildebrandtii</h1>
<p>Buxus hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in formal landscaping and topiary.</p>
