                    <h1>Barbarea vulgaris var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Barbarea vulgaris var. gracilis, commonly known as slender winter cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and features small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by heart-shaped, lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through self-seeding, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
