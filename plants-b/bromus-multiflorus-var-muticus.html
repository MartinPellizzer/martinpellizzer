                    <h1>Bromus multiflorus var. muticus</h1>
<p>Bromus multiflorus var. muticus, commonly known as the silent brome, is a grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
