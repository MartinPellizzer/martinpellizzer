<p>Brachycorythis pleistophylla subsp.</p>
<p>leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopoldâ€™s broad-leafed fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
