<p>Billbergia amoena var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette, with the inner leaves often displaying a yellowish or golden hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
