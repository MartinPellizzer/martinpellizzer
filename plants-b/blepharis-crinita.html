<p>Blepharis crinita, commonly known as the curlytail grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Blepharis crinita is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils.</p>
