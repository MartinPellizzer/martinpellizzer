                    <h1>Begonia polygonata var. longistipulacea</h1>
<p>Begonia polygonata var. longistipulacea, commonly known as the long-stippled begonia, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with prominent veins and stipules, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
