<p>Baccharis acerosa, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments.</p>
<p>Baccharis acerosa is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and birds.</p>
