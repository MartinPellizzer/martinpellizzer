                    <h1>Betula aischatiae</h1>
<p>Betula aischatiae, commonly known as the Aischa's birch, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Betulaceae family, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
