                    <h1>Berberis pseudospinulosa</h1>
<p>Berberis pseudospinulosa, commonly known as the slender barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
