                    <h1>Boea rosselensis</h1>
<p>Boea rosselensis, commonly known as the Cape ivy, is a climbing perennial vine native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering walls, fences, or trellises.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly in certain environments.</p>
