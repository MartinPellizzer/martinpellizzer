                    <h1>Brandegea bigelovii</h1>
<p>Brandegea bigelovii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Brandegea bigelovii is also known for its ability to store water in its bulbs, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
