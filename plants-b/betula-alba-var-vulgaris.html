                    <h1>Betula alba var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. vulgaris, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn golden yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits.</p>
