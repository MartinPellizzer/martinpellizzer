                    <h1>Bermudiana secundiflora</h1>
<p>Bermudiana secundiflora, commonly known as the Bermuda buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a symbol of Bermuda's natural heritage.</p>
