                    <h1>Botryodendrum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Botryodendrum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with linear, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments.</p>
<p>Botryodendrum coriaceum is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
