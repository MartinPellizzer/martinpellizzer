                    <h1>Batemannia meleagris var. albidofulva</h1>
<p>Batemannia meleagris var. albidofulva, commonly known as the white-flowered batemannia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodland edges or stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
