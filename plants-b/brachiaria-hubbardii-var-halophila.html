                    <h1>Brachiaria hubbardii var. halophila</h1>
<p>Brachiaria hubbardii var. halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and other wetlands with high salt content. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in preventing erosion and supporting biodiversity in salt-affected habitats.</p>
