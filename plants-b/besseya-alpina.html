                    <h1>Besseya alpina</h1>
<p>Besseya alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Besseya alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
