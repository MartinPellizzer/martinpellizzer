<p>Braxipis nitida, commonly known as the silky bracken fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the spore-bearing fronds in the second.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
