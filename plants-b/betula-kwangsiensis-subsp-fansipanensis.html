<p>Betula kwangsiensis subsp.</p>
<p>fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunks and lanceolate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant prefers cool, moist climates and is typically found at high altitudes in cloud forests. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment.</p>
