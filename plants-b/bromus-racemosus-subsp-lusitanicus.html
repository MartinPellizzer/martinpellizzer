<p>Bromus racemosus subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanicus, commonly known as the Iberian brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a loose, racemose arrangement of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat diversity.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
