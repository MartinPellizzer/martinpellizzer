                    <h1>Balanophora appressa</h1>
<p>Balanophora appressa, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a small, tuberous root system and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that are often hidden within the foliage of its host. It is typically found growing on the roots of other plants, such as ferns or mosses, in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Balanophora appressa is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
