                    <h1>Betula oxycoviensis var. majuscula</h1>
<p>Betula oxycoviensis var. majuscula, commonly known as the giant birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the birch genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a subtle peeling texture that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>This variant is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions where it thrives in shaded conditions.</p>
