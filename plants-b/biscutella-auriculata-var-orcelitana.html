<p>Biscutella auriculata var. orcelitana, commonly known as the auriculate biscuitroot, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of Europe. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears clusters of four-petaled flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
