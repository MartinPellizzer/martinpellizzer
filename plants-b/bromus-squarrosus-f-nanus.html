                    <h1>Bromus squarrosus f. nanus</h1>
<p>Bromus squarrosus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf speargrass, is a compact, mat-forming grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features short, stiff leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its small stature and dense growth habit make it well-suited for stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
