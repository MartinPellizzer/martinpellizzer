<p>Bletia roezlii, commonly known as the RÃ¶sel's bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture in its growing habitat.</p>
<p>Bletia roezlii is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
