                    <h1>Balanophora pedicellaris</h1>
<p>Balanophora pedicellaris, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features a fleshy, reddish stem and produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are covered in fine, root-like structures called haustoria, which help it attach to host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
