                    <h1>Bruguiera parietosa</h1>
<p>Bruguiera parietosa, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in estuaries and tidal mudflats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are small, thick, and waxy, reducing water loss in high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>Bruguiera parietosa is an essential component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection.</p>
