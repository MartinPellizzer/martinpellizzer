<p>Berberis wettsteiniana, commonly known as the Wettstein barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, holly-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its prickly nature.</p>
