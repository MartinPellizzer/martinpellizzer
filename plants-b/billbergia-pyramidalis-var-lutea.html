<p>Billbergia pyramidalis var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that enclose its showy inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in landscaping and as a houseplant due to its visual impact and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
