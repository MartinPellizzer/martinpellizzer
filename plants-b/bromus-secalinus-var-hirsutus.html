                    <h1>Bromus secalinus var. hirsutus</h1>
<p>Bromus secalinus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often used for erosion control due to its dense growth.</p>
