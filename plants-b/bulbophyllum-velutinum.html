<p>Bulbophyllum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in variable conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually broad and fleshy, contributing to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
