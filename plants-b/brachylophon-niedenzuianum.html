<p>Brachylophon niedenzuianum, commonly known as the Zambian star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically a vibrant mix of purple and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species.</p>
