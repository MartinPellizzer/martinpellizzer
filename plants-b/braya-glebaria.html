                    <h1>Braya glebaria</h1>
<p>Braya glebaria, commonly known as the glabrous braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are arranged in a rosette, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that mature in the summer.</p>
<p>Braya glebaria is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in regions with limited water availability.</p>
