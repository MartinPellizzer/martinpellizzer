                    <h1>Biscutella frutescens</h1>
<p>Biscutella frutescens, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Biscutella frutescens is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
