                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. nanus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, forming dense, mat-like growth that thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its fine, grass-like leaves are often covered in a soft, fuzzy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Bromus mollis var. nanus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry, rocky environments.</p>
