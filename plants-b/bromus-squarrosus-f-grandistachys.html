<p>Bromus squarrosus f. grandistachys, commonly known as the giant tawny grass, is a variant of the tawny grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive, long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that is often more elongated than the typical form of the species. Its botanical features make it well-suited for dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This form is often studied for its ecological role and its potential use in restoration projects.</p>
