<p>Badiera berteroana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
