<p>Betula wiluica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping.</p>
<p>Betula wiluica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
