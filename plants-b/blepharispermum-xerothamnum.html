<p>Blepharispermum xerothamnum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Blepharispermum xerothamnum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
