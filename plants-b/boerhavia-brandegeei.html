<p>Boerhavia brandegeei, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, three-lobed seed pods.</p>
<p>Boerhavia brandegeei is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
