                    <h1>Betula oycowiensis</h1>
<p>Betula oycowiensis, commonly known as the Oycow Island birch, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Oycow Island in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, characterized by smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
