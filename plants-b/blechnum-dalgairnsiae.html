                    <h1>Blechnum dalgairnsiae</h1>
<p>Blechnum dalgairnsiae, commonly known as the Dalgairns' holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
