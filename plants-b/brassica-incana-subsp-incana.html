<p>Brassica incana subsp.</p>
<p>incana, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. After flowering, it develops into a dry, wind-dispersed seed capsule, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world.</p>
