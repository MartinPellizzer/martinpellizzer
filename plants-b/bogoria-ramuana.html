                    <h1>Bogoria ramuana</h1>
<p>Bogoria ramuana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous areas with rich, organic soil. The plant has feathery, delicate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue, which helps it retain moisture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common to most ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
