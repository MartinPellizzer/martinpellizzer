                    <h1>Bulbophyllum papuanum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
