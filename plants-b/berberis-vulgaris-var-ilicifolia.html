                    <h1>Berberis vulgaris var. ilicifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis vulgaris var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems, dark green leaves, and clusters of small, yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to the presence of berberine, a compound with antimicrobial properties.</p>
