<p>Beckwithia glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>camissonis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbell, is a rare and cold-adapted plant species native to high-elevation areas of California. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear.</p>
<p>The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
