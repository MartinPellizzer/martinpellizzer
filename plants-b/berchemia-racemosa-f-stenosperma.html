                    <h1>Berchemia racemosa f. stenosperma</h1>
<p>Berchemia racemosa f. stenosperma, commonly known as the narrow-fruit berchemia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne in racemes, followed by small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It is well-suited to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
