                    <h1>Bromus pumpellianus var. arcticus</h1>
<p>Bromus pumpellianus var. arcticus, commonly known as Arctic brome, is a grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to extreme climates makes it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
