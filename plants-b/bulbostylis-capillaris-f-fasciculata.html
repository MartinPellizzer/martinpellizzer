<p>Bulbostylis capillaris f. fasciculata, commonly known as the fasciculate bulbostylis, is a rare grass species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
