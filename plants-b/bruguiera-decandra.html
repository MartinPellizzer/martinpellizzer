                    <h1>Bruguiera decandra</h1>
<p>Bruguiera decandra, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has a robust root system that includes pneumatophores, specialized structures for oxygen absorption in waterlogged soils. It thrives in coastal areas, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an essential component of mangrove forests.</p>
