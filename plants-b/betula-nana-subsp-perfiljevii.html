<p>Betula nana subsp.</p>
<p>perfiljevii, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically glandular and hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems.</p>
