<p>Billbergia leucantha, commonly known as the white billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with white and green bracts that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia leucantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
