                    <h1>Besleria lanceolata var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Besleria lanceolata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved besleria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, thick, and somewhat leathery leaves, which give it the "coriacea" designation, derived from the Latin word for "coriaceous.". The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
