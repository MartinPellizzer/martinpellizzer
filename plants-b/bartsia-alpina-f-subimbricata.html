<p>Bartsia alpina f. subimbricata, commonly known as the Alpine Bartsia, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The subspecies subimbricata is notable for its unique leaf arrangement, where the leaves are closely overlapping, giving the plant a dense, compact appearance. This plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
