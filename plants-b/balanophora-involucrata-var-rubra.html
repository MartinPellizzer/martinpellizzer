                    <h1>Balanophora involucrata var. rubra</h1>
<p>Balanophora involucrata var. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is typically found growing on the roots of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and bloom in clusters, often resembling those of other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
