                    <h1>Buxus heterophylla</h1>
<p>Buxus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The plant features opposite, scale-like leaves that vary in shape and size depending on the plant's age and environmental conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often used in horticulture for topiary and hedging.</p>
