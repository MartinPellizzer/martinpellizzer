                    <h1>Bouchea beckii</h1>
<p>Bouchea beckii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Bouchea beckii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
