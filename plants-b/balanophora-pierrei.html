                    <h1>Balanophora pierrei</h1>
<p>Balanophora pierrei, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. This species is native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and Georgia. Its flowers are small, white, and resemble those of other ghost orchids, with a delicate, ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and ecological specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
