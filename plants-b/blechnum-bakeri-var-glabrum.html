                    <h1>Blechnum bakeri var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Blechnum bakeri var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a variant of the Blechnum genus native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, with a distinctive bifurcated shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
