                    <h1>Brachystephanus jaundensis</h1>
<p>Brachystephanus jaundensis, commonly known as the yellowstephanus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
