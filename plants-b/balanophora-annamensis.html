                    <h1>Balanophora annamensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora annamensis, commonly known as the Annam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is classified as a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is critically endangered and found only in a few remote locations in Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
