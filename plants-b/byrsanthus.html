                    <h1>Byrsanthus</h1>
<p>Byrsanthus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular shapes that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Byrsanthus species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
