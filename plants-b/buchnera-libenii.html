                    <h1>Buchnera libenii</h1>
<p>Buchnera libenii, commonly known as the yellow mountain lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer of epicarp. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to carry out photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Buchnera libenii is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health in forested areas.</p>
