<p>Bromopsis riparia subsp.</p>
<p>heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green color, while the flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
