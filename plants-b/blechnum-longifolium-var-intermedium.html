<p>Blechnum longifolium var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller, serrated segments.</p>
