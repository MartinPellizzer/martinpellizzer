                            <h1>Bidens Campylotheca</h1>
<p>Bidens campylotheca is a flowering plant native to parts of South America known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and bract-like leaves. This species thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, Bidens campylotheca remains relatively understudied in botanical research.</p>
