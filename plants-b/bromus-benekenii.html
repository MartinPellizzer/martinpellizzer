                    <h1>Bromus benekenii</h1>
<p>Bromus benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's brome, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus benekenii thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as forage for livestock and its contribution to soil stabilization in native ecosystems.</p>
