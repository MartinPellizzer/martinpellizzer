<p>Buprestis difformis, commonly known as the metallic wood-boring beetle, is a species of jewel beetle belonging to the family Buprestidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking metallic green or blue coloration, which serves as a form of camouflage in its natural habitat. The larvae of this species are known to bore into the wood of living trees, where they feed and develop. The adult beetles are typically found in forested areas, where they contribute to the ecological cycle by aiding in the decomposition of wood.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by facilitating the breakdown of organic matter.</p>
