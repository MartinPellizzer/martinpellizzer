                    <h1>Betula alba var. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its unique sticky resin on the bark.</p>
<p>This resin, which gives the plant its common name, is secreted in droplets and can be easily rubbed off. The tree has slender, silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter inner bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The sticky birch is a medium-sized tree with delicate, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
