<p>Bentinckia ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
