<p>Breynia repanda, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red breynia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Breynia repanda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
