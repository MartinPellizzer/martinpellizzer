                    <h1>Belvisia dura</h1>
<p>Belvisia dura, commonly known as the hardy belvisia, is a rare and resilient plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its surroundings. Belvisia dura has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic flora.</p>
