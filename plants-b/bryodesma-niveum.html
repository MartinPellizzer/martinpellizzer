                <h1>Bryodesma niveum</h1>
<p>Bryodesma niveum, commonly known as the white moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white thallus, which often appears as a dense carpet on rocks or tree trunks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a single layer of cells that absorb water and nutrients directly from the environment. Bryodesma niveum is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator of high air humidity and clean air.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental health.</p>
