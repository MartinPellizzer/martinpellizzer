                    <h1>Botrychium × watertonense</h1>
<p>Botrychium × watertonense, commonly known as the Waterton moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the Canadian Rockies.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, spore-producing structures called sorocarps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are arranged in a spiral pattern along the fronds, a feature typical of the Botrychium genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
