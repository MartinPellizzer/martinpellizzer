<p>Bromus conformis, commonly known as the bentgrass or smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, smooth surface, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>Bromus conformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
