                    <h1>Beesha stridula</h1>
<p>Beesha stridula, commonly known as the whistling grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Beesha stridula is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Its unique seed dispersal mechanism involves a structure that releases seeds with a whistling sound when the plant is disturbed.</p>
