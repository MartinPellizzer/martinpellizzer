                    <h1>Borya</h1>
<p>Borya, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic environments, where they thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Borya species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to purple, and their low-growing, mat-forming habit. They have adapted to extreme climates through thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Borya alpina and Borya tibetana, which are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological resilience.</p>
