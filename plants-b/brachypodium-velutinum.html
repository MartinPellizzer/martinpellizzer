<p>Brachypodium velutinum, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Brachypodium velutinum is also valued in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and as a model organism in plant genetics research.</p>
