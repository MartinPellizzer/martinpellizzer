                    <h1>Butomus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Butomus vulgaris, commonly known as the bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance and distinctive triangular stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Butomus vulgaris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life and aiding in water filtration.</p>
