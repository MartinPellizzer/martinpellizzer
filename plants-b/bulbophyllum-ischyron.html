<p>Bulbophyllum ischyron, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
