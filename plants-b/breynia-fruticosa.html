<p>Breynia fruticosa, commonly known as the fire tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often reddish or orange-colored leaves that can store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Breynia fruticosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its ornamental appeal.</p>
