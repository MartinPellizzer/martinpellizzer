                    <h1>Balanophora taiwaniana</h1>
<p>Balanophora taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host without producing chlorophyll. This species is native to Taiwan and is typically found growing on the roots of other plants, often in forest understory environments. Its flowers are small and pale, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly appearance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
