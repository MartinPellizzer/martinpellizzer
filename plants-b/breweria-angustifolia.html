<p>Breweria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brewer's grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate drought due to its deep root system. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal practices for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Brewenia angustifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
