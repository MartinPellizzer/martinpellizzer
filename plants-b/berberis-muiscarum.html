<p>Berberis muiscarum, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
