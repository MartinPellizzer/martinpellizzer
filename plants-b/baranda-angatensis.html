<p>Baranda angatensis, commonly known as the Philippine spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Baranda angatensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
