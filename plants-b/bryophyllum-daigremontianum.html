                    <h1>Bryophyllum daigremontianum</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum daigremontianum, commonly known as the "Mother of Millions," is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-white flowers on spikes during the spring and summer months. One of its most notable features is its ability to propagate through leaf-cuttings, where each leaf can develop into a new plant.</p>
<p>This makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and rapid growth.</p>
