                    <h1>Baptisia × microphylla var. axillaris</h1>
<p>Baptisia × microphylla var. axillaris, commonly known as the dwarf false indigo, is a compact, deciduous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flower spikes that appear in early summer, adding a bold color contrast to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Baptisia × microphylla, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces or rock gardens.</p>
