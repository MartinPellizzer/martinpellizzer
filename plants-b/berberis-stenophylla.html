                    <h1>Berberis stenophylla</h1>
<p>Berberis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, which are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Berberis stenophylla is also notable for its role in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
