                    <h1>Bromus vernalis</h1>
<p>Bromus vernalis, commonly known as spring brome, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Bromus vernalis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
