                    <h1>Basselinia iterata</h1>
<p>Basselinia iterata, commonly known as the slender rockheath, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against extreme temperatures and UV radiation.</p>
<p>Basselinia iterata is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sandy areas.</p>
