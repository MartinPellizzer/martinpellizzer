<p>Buceragenia foliaceobracteata, commonly known as the leafy bract euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into bracts, which are specialized structures that often serve to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Buceragenia foliaceobracteata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
