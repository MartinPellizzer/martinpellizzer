<p>Brassica rapa var. leucoplax, commonly known as the Chinese kale or kale cabbage, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dark green leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for consumption, though the leaves are the primary edible part.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is cultivated for its nutritional value and versatility in cooking.</p>
