                    <h1>Bursera brunea</h1>
<p>Bursera brunea, commonly known as the "Copaiba tree," is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The tree has a rounded crown, smooth gray bark, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its resin, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
