                    <h1>Briza pulchella</h1>
<p>Briza pulchella, commonly known as the slender quillwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that emerge from the water surface, typically in late spring to early summer. Briza pulchella thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological role in water ecosystems make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
