<p>Basselinia billardierei, commonly known as the mountain rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
