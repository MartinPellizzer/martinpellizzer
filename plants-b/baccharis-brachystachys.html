                    <h1>Baccharis brachystachys</h1>
<p>Baccharis brachystachys, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a wildlife plant.</p>
