                    <h1>Bassia decurrens</h1>
<p>Bassia decurrens, commonly known as sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, triangular stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which later develop into spiny, seed-bearing burrs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bassia decurrens is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
