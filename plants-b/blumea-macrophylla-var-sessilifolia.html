                    <h1>Blumea macrophylla var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Blumea macrophylla var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf blumea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in moist forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
