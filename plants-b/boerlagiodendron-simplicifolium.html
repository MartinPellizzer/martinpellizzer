The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
