                    <h1>Bolbitis nagalandensis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis nagalandensis, commonly known as the Nagaland fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a graceful, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
