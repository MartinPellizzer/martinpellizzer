                    <h1>Bolboschoenus glaucus var. macrostachys</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus glaucus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to thrive in shallow water and moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
