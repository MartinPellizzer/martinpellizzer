                    <h1>Blepharoglossum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Blepharoglossum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blepharoglossaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
