                    <h1>Biota</h1>
<p>Biota, commonly known as the collective term for all living organisms in a particular area, encompasses a diverse array of plant and animal life.</p>
<p>In botanical contexts, biota refers to the variety of plant species that inhabit a specific ecosystem. These plants play crucial roles in maintaining ecological balance through processes like photosynthesis and nutrient cycling. The study of biota helps scientists understand biodiversity and environmental health.</p>
<p>Botanical research on biota often focuses on species distribution, adaptation, and conservation efforts.</p>
