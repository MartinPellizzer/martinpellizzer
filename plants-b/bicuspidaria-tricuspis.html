                    <h1>Bicuspidaria tricuspis</h1>
<p>Bicuspidaria tricuspis, commonly known as the three-cusped sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actinioidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed oral disc and long, slender tentacles that are used for capturing prey. The organism exhibits a simple body plan with a central gastrovascular cavity and a basal pedal disc for attachment. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to substrates such as rocks or coral.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to marine biologists studying cnidarian diversity and adaptation.</p>
