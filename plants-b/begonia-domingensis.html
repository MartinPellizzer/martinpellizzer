                    <h1>Begonia domingensis</h1>
<p>Begonia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Begonia domingensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
