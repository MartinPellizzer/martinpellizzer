                    <h1>Brachycorythis oligophylla</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are either male or female, typical of cycads. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
