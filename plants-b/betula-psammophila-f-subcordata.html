                    <h1>Betula psammophila f. subcordata</h1>
<p>Betula psammophila f. subcordata, commonly known as the sand birch or sand white birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sand birch species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, subcordate (heart-shaped at the base) leaves, which are typically shorter and more rounded than those of the typical form. This form thrives in arid and sandy environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh conditions. Its bark is smooth and white, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
