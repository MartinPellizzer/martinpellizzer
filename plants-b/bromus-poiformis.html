<p>Bromus poiformis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus poiformis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
