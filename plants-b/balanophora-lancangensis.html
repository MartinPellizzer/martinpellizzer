                    <h1>Balanophora lancangensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host, typically other plants in the Ericaceae family. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
