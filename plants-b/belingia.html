                    <h1>Belingia</h1>
<p>Belingia, commonly known as the "cow-calf plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a mild aromatic scent. Belingia species are often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>These plants are relatively rare and are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
