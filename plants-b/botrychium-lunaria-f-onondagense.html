                    <h1>Botrychium lunaria f. onondagense</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunaria f. onondagense, commonly known as the Onondaga moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, moon-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, spore-bearing sporangia clustered in a rosette-like arrangement. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range.</p>
