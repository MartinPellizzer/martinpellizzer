                    <h1>Bancalus cordatus</h1>
<p>Bancalus cordatus, commonly known as the scarlet tiger beetle, is a small, predatory beetle with a striking red body and black markings.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Carabidae and is known for its agile movement and predatory behavior. The plant aspect of Bancalus cordatus is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a plant. Its habitat typically includes moist environments such as stream banks and damp leaf litter.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it does not have any botanical features but plays a role in controlling insect populations in its ecosystem.</p>
