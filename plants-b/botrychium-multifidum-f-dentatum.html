                    <h1>Botrychium multifidum f. dentatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium multifidum f. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern with a rosette-like structure of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a broad, lance-shaped blade. The fronds are typically finely divided and have a distinctive toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature of this form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil.</p>
<p>This fern is part of the Ophioglossaceae family and is notable for its primitive evolutionary traits and specialized habitat requirements.</p>
