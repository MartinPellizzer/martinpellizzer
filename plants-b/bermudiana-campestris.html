                    <h1>Bermudiana campestris</h1>
<p>Bermudiana campestris, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, Bermudiana campestris is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop in certain regions.</p>
