<p>Botrychium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It is native to North America and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Botrychium rugulosum is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family, which includes other unique and primitive ferns.</p>
