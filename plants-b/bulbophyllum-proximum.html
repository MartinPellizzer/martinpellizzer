                    <h1>Bulbophyllum proximum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum proximum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's striking white flowers resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
