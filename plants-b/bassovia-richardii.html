<p>Bassovia richardii, commonly known as the Richard's bassovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
