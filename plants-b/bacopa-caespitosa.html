<p>Bacopa caespitosa, commonly known as shore morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes.</p>
<p>Bacopa caespitosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
