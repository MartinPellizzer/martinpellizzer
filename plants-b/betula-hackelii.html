                    <h1>Betula hackelii</h1>
<p>Betula hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a pale yellow-green underside. It produces small, catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
