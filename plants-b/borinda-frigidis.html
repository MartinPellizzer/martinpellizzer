<p>Borinda frigidis, commonly known as the cold-loving shrub, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions with cold climates.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Borinda frigidis is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine areas.</p>
