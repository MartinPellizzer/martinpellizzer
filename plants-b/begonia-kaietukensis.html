                    <h1>Begonia kaietukensis</h1>
<p>Begonia kaietukensis, commonly known as the Kaietukensis begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
