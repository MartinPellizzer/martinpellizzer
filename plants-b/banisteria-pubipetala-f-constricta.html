                    <h1>Banisteria pubipetala f. constricta</h1>
<p>Banisteria pubipetala f. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banisteria, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
