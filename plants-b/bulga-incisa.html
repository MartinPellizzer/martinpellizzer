                    <h1>Bulga incisa</h1>
<p>Bulga incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the autumn and winter months. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bulga incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
