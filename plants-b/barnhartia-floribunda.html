<p>Barnhartia floribunda, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse via the wind. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Barnhartia floribunda is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
