                    <h1>Begonia cucullata var. arenosicola</h1>
<p>Begonia cucullata var. arenosicola, commonly known as the sandhill begonia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sand-like coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
