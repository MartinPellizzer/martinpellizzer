<p>Blaeria klotzschii, commonly known as the Klotzsch's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Blaeria klotzschii is a carnivorous plant, adapting to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
