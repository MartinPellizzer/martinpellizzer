                    <h1>Baccharis arenaria</h1>
<p>Baccharis arenaria, commonly known as sand baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in sandy soils along dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in coastal areas.</p>
