<p>Blackstonia perfoliata subsp.</p>
<p>serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering blackstonia, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often perforated at the center, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
