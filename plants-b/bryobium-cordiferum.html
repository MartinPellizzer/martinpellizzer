<p>Bryobium cordiferum, commonly known as the heartleaf bryobium, is a rare and specialized fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Bryobium cordiferum is known for its intricate and delicate sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
