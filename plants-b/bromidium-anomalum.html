                    <h1>Bromidium anomalum</h1>
<p>Bromidium anomalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and sandstone formations. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. Bromidium anomalum is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
