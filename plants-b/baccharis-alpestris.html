<p>Baccharis alpestris, commonly known as alpine baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, silver-gray foliage, and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, or alpine environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Baccharis alpestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
