<p>Bridelia dasycalyx var. aridicola, commonly known as the desert bridelia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals and insects.</p>
