                    <h1>Briza media f. alpestris</h1>
<p>Briza media f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a compact, clump-forming grass that thrives in open, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is a hardy perennial, often found in alpine and subalpine regions due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance. The plant's low-growing habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to create a soft, flowing texture in garden landscapes.</p>
