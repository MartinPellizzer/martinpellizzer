                    <h1>Basananthe littoralis</h1>
<p>Basananthe littoralis, commonly known as the coastal banana plant, is a tropical species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, banana-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline and is often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to saline environments, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
