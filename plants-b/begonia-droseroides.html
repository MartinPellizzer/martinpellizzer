                    <h1>Begonia droseroides</h1>
<p>Begonia droseroides, commonly known as the dewy begonia, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects, a feature reminiscent of sundews. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Begonia droseroides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in greenhouses or conservatories.</p>
