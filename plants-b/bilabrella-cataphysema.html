                    <h1>Bilabrella cataphysema</h1>
<p>Bilabrella cataphysema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that often appear as if they are floating in the air, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bilabrella cataphysema is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
