<p>Botrychium ternatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pinnately divided fronds that resemble a moon or a shield, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a delicate, spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
