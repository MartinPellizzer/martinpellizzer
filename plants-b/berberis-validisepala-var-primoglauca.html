<p>Berberis validisepala var. primoglauca, commonly known as the white-leaf barberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically white or pale green on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
