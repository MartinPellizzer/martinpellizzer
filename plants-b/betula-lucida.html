<p>Betula lucida, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula lucida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
