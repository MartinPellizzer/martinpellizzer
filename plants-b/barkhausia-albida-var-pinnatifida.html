                    <h1>Barkhausia albida var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Barkhausia albida var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive white to pale grayish-green thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark surfaces of trees, particularly in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a branched structure with a central axis and lateral lobes, which are often pinnately divided. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are usually small and embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
