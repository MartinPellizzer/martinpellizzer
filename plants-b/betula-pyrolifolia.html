<p>Betula pyrolifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins that are important for pollination. Betula pyrolifolia thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and taiga ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
