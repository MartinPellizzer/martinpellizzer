<p>Berteroa physocarpa, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its inflated, seed-filled pods that resemble balloons, which burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
