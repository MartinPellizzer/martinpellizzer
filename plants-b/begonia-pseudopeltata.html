<p>Begonia pseudopeltata, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Begonia pseudopeltata is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
