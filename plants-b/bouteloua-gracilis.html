<p>It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
