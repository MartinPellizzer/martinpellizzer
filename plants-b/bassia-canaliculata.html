                    <h1>Bassia canaliculata</h1>
<p>Bassia canaliculata, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Bassia canaliculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
