                    <h1>Blechnum australe var. aberrans</h1>
<p>Blechnum australe var. aberrans, commonly known as the variable silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a silver-gray underside due to the dense covering of tiny scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'aberrans' reflects its unique morphological variations compared to the typical form of Blechnum australe.</p>
