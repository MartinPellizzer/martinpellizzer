                    <h1>Bermudiana pachyrhiza</h1>
<p>Bermudiana pachyrhiza, commonly known as the Bermuda buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the island of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that allows it to store water and nutrients, enabling survival in the dry, coastal environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
