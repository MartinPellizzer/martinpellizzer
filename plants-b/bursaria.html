<p>Bursaria, commonly known as the "burr bush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and the presence of small, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which aid in seed dispersal. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Bursaria species are native to Australia and some Pacific islands, thriving in a variety of habitats including coastal areas and dry woodlands.</p>
