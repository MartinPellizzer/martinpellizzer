<p>Baccharis artemisioides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Baccharis artemisioides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
