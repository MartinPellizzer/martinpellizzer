<p>Botrychium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan moonwort, is a fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, undivided leaf with a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are positioned on the underside of the frond, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Botrychium yunnanense is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
