<p>Berberis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and border plantings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
