                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broader and more elongated compared to the typical boxwood, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions.</p>
