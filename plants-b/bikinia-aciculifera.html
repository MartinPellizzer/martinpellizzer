                    <h1>Bikinia aciculifera</h1>
<p>Bikinia aciculifera, commonly known as the needleleaf Bikinia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its growth is slow and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
