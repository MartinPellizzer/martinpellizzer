                    <h1>Brexia decurrens</h1>
<p>Brexia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with numerous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Brexia decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions.</p>
