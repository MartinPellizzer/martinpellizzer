<p>Banksia undata var. undata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are usually grey-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are an important nectar source for native bees and birds.</p>
<p>The woody follicles that follow the flowers contain hard seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in the plant's regeneration.</p>
