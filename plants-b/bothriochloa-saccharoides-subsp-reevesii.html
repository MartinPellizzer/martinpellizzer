<p>Bothriochloa saccharoides subsp.</p>
<p>reevesii, commonly known as Reeves' sugarcane grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals.</p>
