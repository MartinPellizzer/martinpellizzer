<p>Bashania abietina, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines, in temperate and boreal forests. The thallus is leathery and pale green, with a distinctive white or pale yellow coloration on the upper surface. It lacks a distinct upper cortex and has a simple, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
