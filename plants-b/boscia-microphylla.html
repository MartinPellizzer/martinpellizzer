<p>Boscia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf bosco or small-leaved bosco, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various animals. Boscia microphylla is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
