                    <h1>Belotia colombiana</h1>
<p>Belotia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian belotia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Belotia colombiana is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
