                    <h1>Betula emarginata</h1>
<p>Betula emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula emarginata is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
