                    <h1>Bigelovia setidens</h1>
<p>Bigelovia setidens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the production of wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Bigelovia setidens is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
