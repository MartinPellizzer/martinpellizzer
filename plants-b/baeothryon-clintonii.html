                    <h1>Baeothryon clintonii</h1>
<p>Baeothryon clintonii, commonly known as Clinton's bryophyte, is a rare and specialized moss species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with tightly packed, cushion-like structures composed of leaf-like shoots. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are typically borne on short stalks and release spores during the late summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Baeothryon clintonii is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health and environmental stability.</p>
