                    <h1>Betula longifolia</h1>
<p>Betula longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula longifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
