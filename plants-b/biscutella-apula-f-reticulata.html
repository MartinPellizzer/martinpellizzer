<p>Biscutella apula f. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate biscuitroot, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
