                    <h1>Berberis calcipratorum</h1>
<p>Berberis calcipratorum, commonly known as the limestone barberry, is a shrub native to the rocky, arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its architectural form and seasonal interest.</p>
