                    <h1>Baccharis sergiloides</h1>
<p>Baccharis sergiloides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and dense growth habit make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>Baccharis sergiloides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
