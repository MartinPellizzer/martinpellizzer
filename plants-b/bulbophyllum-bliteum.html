                    <h1>Bulbophyllum bliteum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum bliteum, commonly known as the Bliteum Pterostylis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble a small, elongated orchid with a single, forward-facing lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall understated appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
