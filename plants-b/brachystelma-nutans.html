<p>Brachystelma nutans, commonly known as the drooping stone orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky outcrops and has a short, squat stem with a few leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that hang downward, which is why it is named "nutans," meaning drooping in Latin. Its flowers are usually solitary and bloom during the winter months.</p>
<p>Brachystelma nutans is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
