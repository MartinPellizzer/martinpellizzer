                    <h1>Balanophora japonica</h1>
<p>Balanophora japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host, typically other plants in the Ericaceae family. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
