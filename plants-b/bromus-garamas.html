<p>Bromus garamas, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Bromus garamas is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
