<p>Buxus wallichiana var. velutina, commonly known as velvet boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that is slightly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy appearance and remain throughout the year. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in hedges and topiary due to its slow growth and hardiness.</p>
