                    <h1>Begonia vivipara</h1>
<p>Begonia vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing begonia, is a unique species that produces plantlets directly on its stems.</p>
<p>These plantlets are able to root and grow independently, allowing for easy propagation. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant typically features thick, fleshy leaves and produces small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Its ability to generate offspring without seeds makes it a fascinating example of vegetative reproduction in the botanical world.</p>
