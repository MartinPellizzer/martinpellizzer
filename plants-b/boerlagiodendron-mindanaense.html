<p>Boerlagiodendron mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been historically used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
