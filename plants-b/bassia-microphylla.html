                    <h1>Bassia microphylla</h1>
<p>Bassia microphylla, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It often grows in open habitats such as deserts, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
