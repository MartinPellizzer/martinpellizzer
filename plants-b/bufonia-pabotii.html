                    <h1>Bufonia pabotii</h1>
<p>Bufonia pabotii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers open at night and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by reducing competition with diurnal flowers.</p>
<p>Bufonia pabotii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming habit.</p>
