<p>Brachyactis ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a potential candidate for restoration projects.</p>
