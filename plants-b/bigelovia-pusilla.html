                    <h1>Bigelovia pusilla</h1>
<p>Bigelovia pusilla, commonly known as the small bigelovia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Bigelovia pusilla is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
