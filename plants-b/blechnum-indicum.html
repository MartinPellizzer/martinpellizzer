<p>Blechnum indicum, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often adorned with tiny, tooth-like serrations.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
