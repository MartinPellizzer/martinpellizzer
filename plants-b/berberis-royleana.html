<p>Berberis royleana, commonly known as the Kashmiri barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant seasonal color changes and hardy nature.</p>
