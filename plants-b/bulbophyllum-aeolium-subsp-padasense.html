<p>Bulbophyllum aeolium subsp.</p>
<p>padasense, commonly known as the Padasen's ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with a slender, wiry stem and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are often pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
