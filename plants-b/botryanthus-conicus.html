<p>Botryanthus conicus, commonly known as the conical bottle tree, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has a distinct conical shape, with a narrow base and a broad, rounded top. Its leaves are small and fleshy, typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are yellow or orange, appear at the top of the plant and are clustered in a bottle-like structure.</p>
