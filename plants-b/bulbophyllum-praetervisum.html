                    <h1>Bulbophyllum praetervisum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum praetervisum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
