                    <h1>Bradburya insulana</h1>
<p>Bradburya insulana, commonly known as the insular bradburya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bradburya insulana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
