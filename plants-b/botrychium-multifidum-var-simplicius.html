                    <h1>Botrychium multifidum var. simplicius</h1>
<p>Botrychium multifidum var. simplicius, commonly known as the simple fronded moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, often bi- or tri-lobed sporangia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant's fronds are usually simple and unbranched, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, often rounded or lobed arrangement.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its primitive morphology and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns.</p>
