                    <h1>Baccharis filifolia</h1>
<p>Baccharis filifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form a dense network that aids in soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>Baccharis filifolia is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage.</p>
