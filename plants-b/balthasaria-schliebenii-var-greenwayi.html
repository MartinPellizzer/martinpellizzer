                    <h1>Balthasaria schliebenii var. greenwayi</h1>
<p>Balthasaria schliebenii var. greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's balthasaria, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
