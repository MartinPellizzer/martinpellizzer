                    <h1>Bulbophyllum hamadryas var. orientale</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum hamadryas var. orientale, commonly known as the Oriental Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces intricate, spiral-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
