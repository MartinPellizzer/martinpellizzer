<p>Banksia littoralis var. seminuda, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after the cones dry and open. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
