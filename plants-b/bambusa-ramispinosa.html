                    <h1>Bambusa ramispinosa</h1>
<p>Bambusa ramispinosa, commonly known as the spiny bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright culms that are often covered with sharp, spiny projections, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish inflorescences that appear at the ends of the culms. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bambusa ramispinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique appearance.</p>
