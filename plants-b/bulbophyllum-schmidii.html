                    <h1>Bulbophyllum schmidii</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum schmidii, commonly known as the Schmidâ€™s ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Its flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days, and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
