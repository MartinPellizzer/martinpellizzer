<p>Blatti caseolaris, commonly known as the case-bearing beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Blattellidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and a distinctive case made from soil and plant debris, which it carries for protection. The beetle's exoskeleton is typically dark-colored, ranging from black to brown, and it has well-developed legs for crawling. It is primarily found in moist environments such as under logs, stones, or in leaf litter.</p>
<p>The plant-based case serves as a shelter and is often constructed from fragments of leaves and other organic materials.</p>
