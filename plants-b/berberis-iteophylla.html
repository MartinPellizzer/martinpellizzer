                    <h1>Berberis iteophylla</h1>
<p>Berberis iteophylla, commonly known as the redleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn, and its spiny stems that provide natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, Berberis iteophylla is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
