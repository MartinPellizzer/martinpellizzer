                    <h1>Botrychium zeylanicum</h1>
<p>Botrychium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, underground rhizome with a short, erect shoot above ground. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is typically located on the underside of the frond. Botrychium zeylanicum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a distinctive yet rare botanical specimen.</p>
