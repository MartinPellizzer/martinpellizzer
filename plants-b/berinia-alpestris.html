<p>Berinia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Berinia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
