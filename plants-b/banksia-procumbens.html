<p>Banksia procumbens, commonly known as the dwarf banksia, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce yellow to orange flowers, which are attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its rootstock after bushfires.</p>
<p>Banksia procumbens plays an important ecological role in its native region, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
