                    <h1>Bromus × husnotii</h1>
<p>Bromus × husnotii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile, naturally occurring hybrid between Bromus rigidus and Bromus inermis.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in open fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
