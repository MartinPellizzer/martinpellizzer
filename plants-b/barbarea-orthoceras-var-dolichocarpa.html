<p>Barbarea orthoceras var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-seeded rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The seeds are elongated and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize harsh, open habitats.</p>
