<p>Behaimia roigii, commonly known as the RÃ­o Negro cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
