<p>Baeometra uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower baeometra, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces a single, showy flower per stem. The plant's leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure.</p>
<p>Baeometra uniflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
