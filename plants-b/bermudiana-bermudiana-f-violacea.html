<p>Bermudiana bermudiana f. violacea, commonly known as the purple-flowered Bermuda buttercup, is a rare and striking variant of the Bermuda buttercup.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep violet to almost purple petals, which contrast sharply with its bright yellow center. This plant is typically found in coastal areas of Bermuda, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline conditions. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the local landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
