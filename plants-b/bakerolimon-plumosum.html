<p>Bakerolimon plumosum, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a powdery or silky texture, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Bakerolimon plumosum is commonly used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
