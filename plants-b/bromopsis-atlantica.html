                    <h1>Bromopsis atlantica</h1>
<p>Bromopsis atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Bromopsis atlantica is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance is notable in coastal ecosystems, where it contributes to biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
