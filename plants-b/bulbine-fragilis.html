<p>Bulbine fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bulbous plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often grown in containers to protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
