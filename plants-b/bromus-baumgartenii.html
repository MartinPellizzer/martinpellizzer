                    <h1>Bromus baumgartenii</h1>
<p>Bromus baumgartenii, commonly known as the Baumann's brome, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is adapted to survive in cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Bromus baumgartenii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
