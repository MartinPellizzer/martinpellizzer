                    <h1>Butyrospermum parkii var. poissonii</h1>
<p>Butyrospermum parkii var. poissonii, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a variant of the shea tree native to the savannas of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a valuable nut from which shea butter is extracted, used in cosmetics and food products. The fruit has a thick, fibrous outer layer that encases the hard, oily kernel.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species within the Vitellaria genus and shares similar ecological and economic importance.</p>
