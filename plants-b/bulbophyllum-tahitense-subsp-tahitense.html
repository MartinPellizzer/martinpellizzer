<p>Bulbophyllum tahitense subsp.</p>
<p>tahitense, commonly known as the Tahitian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
