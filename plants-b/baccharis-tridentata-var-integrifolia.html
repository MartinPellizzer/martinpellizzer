                    <h1>Baccharis tridentata var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Baccharis tridentata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with entire margins, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Baccharis tridentata var. integrifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
