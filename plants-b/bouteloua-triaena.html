<p>Bouteloua triaena, commonly known as gray grama, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Gray grama is often found in prairies, sandy soils, and disturbed areas, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and resilience make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
