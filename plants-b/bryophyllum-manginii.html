<p>Bryophyllum manginii, commonly known as the Mangin's leaf plant, is a succulent species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it can propagate through both vegetative means and seeds.</p>
<p>Bryophyllum manginii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
