                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sterile</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sterile, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a visible flower spike and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees or rocks. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or white, making it visually striking.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
