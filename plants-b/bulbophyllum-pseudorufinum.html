                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pseudorufinum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pseudorufinum, commonly known as the red-rimmed ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, pale pink to reddish sepals and petals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
