                    <h1>Biscutella glacialis var. harana</h1>
<p>Biscutella glacialis var. harana, commonly known as the alpine biscuit flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and pale blue to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
