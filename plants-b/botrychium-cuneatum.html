<p>Botrychium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in temperate regions of North America. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>Botrychium cuneatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
