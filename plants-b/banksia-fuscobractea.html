<p>Banksia fuscobractea, commonly known as the grey bract banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones and dark, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, greyish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and mammals, particularly honeyeaters.</p>
<p>Banksia fuscobractea is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
