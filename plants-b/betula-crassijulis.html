<p>Betula crassijulis, commonly known as the broad-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Betula crassijulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
