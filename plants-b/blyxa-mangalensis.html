<p>Blyxa mangalensis, commonly known as the mangrove blyxa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters at the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it relies on water for pollination.</p>
<p>Blyxa mangalensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
