                    <h1>Bilegnum medium</h1>
<p>Bilegnum medium, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often inflated and resemble bladders, which help it to float on the water's surface. The plant traps small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures that create suction to draw in prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
