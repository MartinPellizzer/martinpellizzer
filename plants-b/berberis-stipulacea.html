                    <h1>Berberis stipulacea</h1>
<p>Berberis stipulacea, commonly known as the stipulate barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting berries.</p>
