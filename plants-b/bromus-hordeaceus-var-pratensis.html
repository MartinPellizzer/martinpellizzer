<p>Bromus hordeaceus var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
