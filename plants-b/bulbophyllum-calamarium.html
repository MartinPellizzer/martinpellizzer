                    <h1>Bulbophyllum calamarium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum calamarium, commonly known as the sea horse orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble the shape of a sea horse, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle citrus scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss.</p>
