<p>Bifaria caudiculata, commonly known as the Cape candelabra, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, branched stem that resembles a candelabra, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bifaria caudiculata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance.</p>
