<p>Blechum linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean blechum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Blechum linnaei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
