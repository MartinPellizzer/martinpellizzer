<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with woody stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces a unique, three-lobed fruit that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
