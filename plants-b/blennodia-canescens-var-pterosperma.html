                    <h1>Blennodia canescens var. pterosperma</h1>
<p>Blennodia canescens var. pterosperma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or traditional uses.</p>
