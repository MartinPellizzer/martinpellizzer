                    <h1>Berberis pruinosa var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis pruinosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but have a sharp taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Berberis pruinosa, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
