                    <h1>Baillonella heckelii</h1>
<p>Baillonella heckelii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, bladder-like seed pods. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Baillonella heckelii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
