                    <h1>Betula nana var. reducta</h1>
<p>Betula nana var. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Betula nana var. reducta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
