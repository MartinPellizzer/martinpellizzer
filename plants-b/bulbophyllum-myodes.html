                    <h1>Bulbophyllum myodes</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum myodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender pseudobulbs and long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bulbophyllum myodes is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
