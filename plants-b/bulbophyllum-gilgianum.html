                    <h1>Bulbophyllum gilgianum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum gilgianum, commonly known as the Gilgian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
