                    <h1>Breynia</h1>
<p>Breynia, commonly known as the fireplant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking, often red or orange-colored leaves that resemble flames, hence its common name. Breynia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties producing small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
