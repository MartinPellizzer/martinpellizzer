                    <h1>Baccharis myriocephala</h1>
<p>Baccharis myriocephala, commonly known as the Mexican baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Baccharis myriocephala is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
