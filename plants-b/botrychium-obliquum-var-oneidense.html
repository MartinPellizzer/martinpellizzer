                    <h1>Botrychium obliquum var. oneidense</h1>
<p>Botrychium obliquum var. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small, fern-like fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bifurcated fronds that resemble a pair of scimitars, with the upper frond often curving downward. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which are typically located near the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, woodland soils.</p>
<p>This variety is native to eastern North America and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
