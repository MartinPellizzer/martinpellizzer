                    <h1>Barnadesia laurifolia</h1>
<p>Barnadesia laurifolia, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red or orange berries. Its rapid growth rate and attractive foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
