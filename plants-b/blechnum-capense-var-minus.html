                    <h1>Blechnum capense var. minus</h1>
<p>Blechnum capense var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically shorter and narrower compared to the standard variety, giving it a more delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, contributing to its resilience in challenging habitats.</p>
