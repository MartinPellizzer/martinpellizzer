<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other sunflowers, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of smaller, tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds.
