<p>Berberis elongata, commonly known as the longleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny branches, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Berberis elongata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
