                    <h1>Berberis microphylla var. gracilior</h1>
<p>Berberis microphylla var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender barberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form, vibrant foliage, and seasonal color changes.</p>
