<p>Bikkia australis var. fosteriana, commonly known as the coastal bikkia, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
