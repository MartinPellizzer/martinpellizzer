                    <h1>Becium knyanum var. diffusum</h1>
<p>Becium knyanum var. diffusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved becium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, sunny environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
