                    <h1>Beaucarnea ameliae</h1>
<p>Beaucarnea ameliae, commonly known as the Amelia's Elephant Tree, is a unique succulent native to the tropical dry forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, gnarled trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has sparse, fibrous roots and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its most striking feature is its unusual, tree-like appearance with a thick, woody base.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
