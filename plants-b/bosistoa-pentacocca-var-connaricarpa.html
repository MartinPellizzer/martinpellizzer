<p>Bosistoa pentacocca var. connaricarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
