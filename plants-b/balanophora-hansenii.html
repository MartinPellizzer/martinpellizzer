                    <h1>Balanophora hansenii</h1>
<p>Balanophora hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, pale green or white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Balanophora hansenii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
