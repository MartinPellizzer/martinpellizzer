                    <h1>Begonia nigrescens</h1>
<p>Begonia nigrescens, commonly known as the black begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves that contrast sharply with its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its unique leaf coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments.</p>
<p>Begonia nigrescens is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
