<p>Begonia divaricata f. typica, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a compact, trailing perennial native to Southeast Asia.</p>

It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
