                    <h1>Bromus pindicus</h1>
<p>Bromus pindicus, commonly known as the Pindus brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
<p>Bromus pindicus is also used in some ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
