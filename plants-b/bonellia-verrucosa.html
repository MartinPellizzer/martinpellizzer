<p>Bonellia verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy sponge or sea sponge, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, porous body that allows water to flow through it, facilitating filter feeding. The sponge's body is covered in fine, hair-like structures called oscula, which aid in exhalation. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and can be found attached to rocks or other substrates.</p>
<p>Bonellia verrucosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its filter-feeding activity.</p>
