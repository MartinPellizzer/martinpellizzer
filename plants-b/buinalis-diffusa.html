                    <h1>Buinalis diffusa</h1>
<p>Buinalis diffusa, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Buinalis diffusa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
