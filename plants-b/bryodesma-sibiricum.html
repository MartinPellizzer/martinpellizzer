<p>Bryodesma sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian moss, is a species of liverwort found in cold, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate leaf-like structures called thallus. This plant thrives in shaded, rocky, or soil-rich habitats, typically in temperate to subarctic regions. Bryodesma sibiricum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
