                    <h1>Bulbophyllum bivalve</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum bivalve, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, two-lobed pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
