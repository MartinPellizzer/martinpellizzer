                    <h1>Brachyscome diversifolia var. maritima</h1>
<p>Brachyscome diversifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, surrounded by white to pale green bracts. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
