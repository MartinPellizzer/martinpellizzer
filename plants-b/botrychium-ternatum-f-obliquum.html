                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum f. obliquum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum f. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single, lance-shaped sporophyll that bears two pairs of spore sacs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas, and is often found in the northern hemisphere. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the sporophyll being the primary photosynthetic organ.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in ecological studies of understory vegetation.</p>
