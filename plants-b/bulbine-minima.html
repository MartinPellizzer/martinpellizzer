                    <h1>Bulbine minima</h1>
<p>Bulbine minima, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous plant, is a small, succulent perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
