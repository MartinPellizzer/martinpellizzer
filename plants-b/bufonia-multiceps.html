                    <h1>Bufonia multiceps</h1>
<p>Bufonia multiceps, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a large, edible fungus that belongs to the family Agaricaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, spongy cap that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and a stem that is usually shorter than the cap. The fruiting body develops from a spherical, smooth, white mycelium that emerges from the ground. It is typically found in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides, especially in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the underside of the cap, which is initially covered with a membranous veil that breaks as the fungus matures.</p>
