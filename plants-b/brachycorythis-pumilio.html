<p>Brachycorythis pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this species thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
