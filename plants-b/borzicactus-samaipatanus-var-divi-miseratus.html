<p>Borzicactus samaipatanus var. divi-miseratus, commonly known as the "Sad and Miserable Cactus," is a rare and striking cactus native to the dry regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with a distinctive blue-gray coloration and sparse, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are short-lived but visually striking. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
