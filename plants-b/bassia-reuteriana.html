                    <h1>Bassia reuteriana</h1>
<p>Bassia reuteriana, commonly known as Russian spinach, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable due to its mild, spinach-like flavor.</p>
<p>Bassia reuteriana is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
