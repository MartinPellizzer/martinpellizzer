<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>Baccharis pellucida is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
