<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, maple-like leaves that display a wide range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, especially in response to light conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
