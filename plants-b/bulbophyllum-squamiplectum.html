<p>Bulbophyllum squamiplectum, commonly known as the scalloped leaf orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and linear, often scalloped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
