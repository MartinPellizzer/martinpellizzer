<p>Bersama holstii, commonly known as the Holstii cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and preference for well-drained soil make it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
