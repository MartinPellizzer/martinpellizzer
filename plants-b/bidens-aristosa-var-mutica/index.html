                            <h1>Bidens Aristosa Var. Mutica</h1>
<p>Bidens aristosa var. mutica is a lesser-known member of the sunflower family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This variant of the common beggar's ticks thrives in a variety of habitats, including wetlands and disturbed soils across North America. Its small, yellow flowers and bristly seed pods make it easily identifiable, though often overlooked in favor of more showy plants. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environments. Despite its modest stature, Bidens aristosa var. mutica holds value in both ecological and botanical studies.</p>
