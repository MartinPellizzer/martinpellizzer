                    <h1>Bonjeanea venusta</h1>
<p>Bonjeanea venusta, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a central white or pale yellow star-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonjeanea venusta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
