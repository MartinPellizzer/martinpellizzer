<p>Botryopsis platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, flattened leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporophytes are short and stout, with a capsule that is often covered in a thick, waxy layer.</p>
<p>Botryopsis platyphylla is well adapted to humid, nutrient-poor conditions and is an important component of many temperate and boreal ecosystems.</p>
