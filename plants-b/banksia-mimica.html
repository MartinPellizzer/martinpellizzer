                    <h1>Banksia mimica</h1>
<p>Banksia mimica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia mimica is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
