                    <h1>Blepharis integrifolia var. clarkei</h1>
<p>Blepharis integrifolia var. clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to reddish in color. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
