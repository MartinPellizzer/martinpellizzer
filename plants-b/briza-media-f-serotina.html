                    <h1>Briza media f. serotina</h1>
<p>Briza media f. serotina, commonly known as the late-fruiting quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and other open, sunny habitats. Its flowering period occurs later in the season compared to the typical form of Briza media, hence the "serotina" subspecific name, meaning "late-bearing.".</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
