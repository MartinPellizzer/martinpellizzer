<p>Blechnum loxense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are often folded or twisted. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Blechnum loxense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
