<p>Brachycorythis iantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are narrow and leathery in texture. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Native to the humid lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
