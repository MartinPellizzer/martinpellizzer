                    <h1>Blechnum × aggregatum</h1>
<p>Blechnum × aggregatum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Blechnum capillipes and Blechnum penna-marina.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
