                    <h1>Betula prochorowii</h1>
<p>Betula prochorowii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a species of birch native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
