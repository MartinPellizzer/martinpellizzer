                    <h1>Bugula moschata</h1>
<p>Bugula moschata, commonly known as the musk tunicate, is a species of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Chordata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body covered in a silken, fibrous tunic. This organism is typically found in coastal waters, attaching itself to surfaces such as rocks or artificial structures. Bugula moschata plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to biofilm communities.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for marine biological studies.</p>
