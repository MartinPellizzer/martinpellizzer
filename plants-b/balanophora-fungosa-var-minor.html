                    <h1>Balanophora fungosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Balanophora fungosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with a unique, intricate structure typical of orchids. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
