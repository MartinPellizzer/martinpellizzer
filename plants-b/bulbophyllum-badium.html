                    <h1>Bulbophyllum badium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum badium, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant grows on tree branches and derives its nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around it. Its flowers typically bloom during the wet season, and it has a short flowering period.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
