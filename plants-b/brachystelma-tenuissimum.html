                    <h1>Brachystelma tenuissimum</h1>
<p>Brachystelma tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, stem-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for container gardening and xeriscaping.</p>
