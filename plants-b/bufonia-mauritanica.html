                    <h1>Bufonia mauritanica</h1>
<p>Bufonia mauritanica, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features woody stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the warm seasons. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in sandy soils, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Bufonia mauritanica plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
