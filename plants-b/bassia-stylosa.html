                    <h1>Bassia stylosa</h1>
<p>Bassia stylosa, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, green to yellowish, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in spikes. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Bassia stylosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
