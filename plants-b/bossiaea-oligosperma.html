                    <h1>Bossiaea oligosperma</h1>
<p>Bossiaea oligosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, dense clusters of white or cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bossiaea oligosperma is often found in heathlands and coastal shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
