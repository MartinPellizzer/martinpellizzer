<p>Blechnum poeppigianum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
