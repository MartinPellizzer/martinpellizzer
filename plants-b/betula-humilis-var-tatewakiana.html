<p>It is native to Japan and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, triangular leaves. The bark of this plant is typically smooth and pale, with a slight reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
