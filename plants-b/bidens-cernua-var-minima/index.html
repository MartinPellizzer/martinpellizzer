                            <h1>Bidens Cernua Var. Minima</h1>
<p>Bidens cernua var. minima is a small, delicate flowering plant commonly found in moist, sunny habitats across eastern North America. Known for its tiny, daisy-like flowers and sprawling growth habit, it often thrives in disturbed soils and along stream banks. This variety is a close relative of the common beggar's ticks, but it is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact form. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful pioneer species and a potential weed in certain environments. Despite its humble appearance, Bidens cernua var. minima plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
