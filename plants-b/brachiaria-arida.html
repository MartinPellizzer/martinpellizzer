                    <h1>Brachiaria arida</h1>
<p>Brachiaria arida, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Brachiaria arida is often used in erosion control and as forage for livestock due to its hardiness and resilience.</p>
