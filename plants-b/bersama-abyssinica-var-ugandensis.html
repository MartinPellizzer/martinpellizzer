                    <h1>Bersama abyssinica var. ugandensis</h1>
<p>Bersama abyssinica var. ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the highlands of Uganda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, rugged bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable but seldom cultivated species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
