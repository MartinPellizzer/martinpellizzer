                    <h1>Breynia rostrata</h1>
<p>Breynia rostrata, commonly known as the red-flowered breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its stems are often branched and can become woody with age, contributing to its structural resilience.</p>
<p>Breynia rostrata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh conditions.</p>
