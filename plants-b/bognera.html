                    <h1>Bognera</h1>
<p>Bognera, commonly known as marsh carnation, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Bognera grandiflora, which is native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help them survive in moist, often nutrient-poor environments. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central spur.</p>
<p>Bognera thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other boggy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
