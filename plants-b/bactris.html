                    <h1>Bactris</h1>
<p>Bactris, commonly known as the areca palm or red palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bactris species are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. They produce small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or as sources of edible fruits.</p>
<p>The genus includes several economically important species, such as Bactris gasipaes, which is used for its fruit and fiber.</p>
