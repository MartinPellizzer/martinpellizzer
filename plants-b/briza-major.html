                    <h1>Briza major</h1>
<p>Briza major, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching stems and feathery, seed-bearing inflorescences that sway gently in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Briza major is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
