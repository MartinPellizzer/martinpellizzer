                <h1>Breynia rhamnoides</h1>
<p>Breynia rhamnoides, commonly known as the fire tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores.</p>
<p>Breynia rhamnoides is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
