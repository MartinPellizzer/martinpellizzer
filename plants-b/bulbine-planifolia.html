                    <h1>Bulbine planifolia</h1>
<p>Bulbine planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved bulbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Bulbine planifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
