                            <h1>Banksia Phylicifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia phylicifolia is a striking evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is known for its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting a variety of pollinators. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its unique leaf structure, resembling that of the plantain, gives it its common name. Despite its beauty, it is also a hardy species capable of surviving in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
