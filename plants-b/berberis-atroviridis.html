<p>Berberis atroviridis, commonly known as the dark green barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow-green in the autumn. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Berberis atroviridis is also noted for its ability to tolerate harsh climates and is sometimes used in erosion control.</p>
