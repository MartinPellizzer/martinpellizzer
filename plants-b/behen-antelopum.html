<p>Behen antelopum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat.</p>
