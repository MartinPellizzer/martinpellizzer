                    <h1>Breynia rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Breynia rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned breynia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Breynia rhynchocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
