                    <h1>Billbergia caespitosa</h1>
<p>Billbergia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth pattern, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia caespitosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
