<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as the saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal marshes and estuaries, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to the structure of saltwater wetlands.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the vegetation in tidal zones along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America.</p>
