<p>Bactris chaveziae, commonly known as the Ch√°vez's palm, is a species of palm native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by edible, round fruits that are similar in appearance to dates. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
