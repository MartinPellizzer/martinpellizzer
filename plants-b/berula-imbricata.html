                    <h1>Berula imbricata</h1>
<p>Berula imbricata, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that produce broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Berula imbricata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
