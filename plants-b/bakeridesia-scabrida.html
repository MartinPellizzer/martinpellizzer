<p>Bakeridesia scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf bakeridesia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
