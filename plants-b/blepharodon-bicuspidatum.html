                    <h1>Blepharodon bicuspidatum</h1>
<p>Blepharodon bicuspidatum, commonly known as the two-toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems may be partially emergent.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
