<p>Briggsia agnesiae, commonly known as the Agnesiae's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between November and February. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unique aesthetic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Briggsia agnesiae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
