The plant produces striking red and orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding vibrant color to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities.</p>
