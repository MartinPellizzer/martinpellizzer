                    <h1>Botrychium daucifolium</h1>
<p>Botrychium daucifolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, upright rhizome with a rosette of dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium daucifolium is found across much of Europe, Asia, and North America, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems as a cryptogamic component.</p>
