<p>Busbeckea arborea, commonly known as the tree hakea, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces striking, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects.
