<p>Beaucarnea lindheimeriana, commonly known as the Lindheimer's elephant tree, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, branching stems that resemble the trunk of an elephant, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic structure.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping.</p>
