                <h1>Blechnopsis pyrophila</h1>
<p>Blechnopsis pyrophila, commonly known as the flame fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it to anchor in rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Blechnopsis pyrophila is adapted to withstand periodic fires, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
