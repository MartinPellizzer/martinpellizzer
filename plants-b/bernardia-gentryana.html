<p>Bernardia gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's bernardia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the cloud forests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
