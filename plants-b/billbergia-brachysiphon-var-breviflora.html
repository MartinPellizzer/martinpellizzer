                    <h1>Billbergia brachysiphon var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Billbergia brachysiphon var. breviflora, commonly known as the short-stemmed billbergia, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to hold water. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
