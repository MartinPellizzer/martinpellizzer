                            <h1>Bombax Quinatum</h1>
<p>Bombax quinatum, also known as the red silk cotton tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. This tree is notable for its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Its fluffy, cotton-like fruits are a unique feature, containing seeds encased in a soft, white pulp. The plant is commonly found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Despite its ecological and aesthetic significance, it remains relatively underappreciated in global horticulture.</p>
