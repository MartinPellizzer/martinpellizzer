                    <h1>Bromheadia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Bromheadia brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bromhead, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vivid contrast to its foliage. Bromheadia brevifolia thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
