<p>Bupleurum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne in dense inflorescences. It is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Bupleurum stenophyllum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is less common compared to other species in the genus.</p>
