                    <h1>Betula ashburneri</h1>
<p>Betula ashburneri, commonly known as the Ashburner's birch, is a rare and unique species of birch native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn golden in the fall. Betula ashburneri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its limited natural range makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
