<p>Bactris negrensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm or lesser bactris, is a small, compact palm native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling cherries. Its leaves are palmate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
