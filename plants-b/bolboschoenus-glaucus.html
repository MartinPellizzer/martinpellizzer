                    <h1>Bolboschoenus glaucus</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus glaucus, commonly known as the white marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus glaucus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
