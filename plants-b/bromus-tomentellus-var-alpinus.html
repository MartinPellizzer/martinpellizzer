<p>Bromus tomentellus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Bromus tomentellus var. alpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
