                    <h1>Baudouinia fluggeiformis</h1>
<p>Baudouinia fluggeiformis, commonly known as the flugge's beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, woolly texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
