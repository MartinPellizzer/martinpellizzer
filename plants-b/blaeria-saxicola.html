<p>Blaeria saxicola, commonly known as the rock bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are short and rounded, often forming dense clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Blaeria saxicola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
