<p>Borzicactus acanthurus subsp.</p>
<p>pullatus, commonly known as the red-tipped barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a reddish tint at the tips.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
