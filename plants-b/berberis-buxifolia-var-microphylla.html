                    <h1>Berberis buxifolia var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Berberis buxifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf barberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often avoided by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
