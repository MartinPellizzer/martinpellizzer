<p>Bulbophyllum alveatum, commonly known as the honeycomb orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, honeycomb-like structures on its pseudobulbs, which are specialized stems adapted for storing water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive pattern resembling a honeycomb. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum alveatum is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
