<p>Bromus variegatus subsp.</p>
<p>villosulus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
