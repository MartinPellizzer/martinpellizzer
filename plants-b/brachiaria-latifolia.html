                    <h1>Brachiaria latifolia</h1>
<p>Brachiaria latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Brachiaria latifolia is also noted for its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions.</p>
