                    <h1>Blastocaulon rupestre</h1>
<p>Blastocaulon rupestre, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure is a composite of fungal hyphae and algal cells, forming a crust-like growth that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
