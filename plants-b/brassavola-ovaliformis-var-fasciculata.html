<p>Brassavola ovaliformis var. fasciculata, commonly known as the fasciculate spider orchid, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its striking, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
