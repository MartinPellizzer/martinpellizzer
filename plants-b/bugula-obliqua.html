                    <h1>Bugula obliqua</h1>
<p>Bugula obliqua, commonly known as the oblique bugula, is a species of marine bryozoan found in coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of calcareous spicules. The colony forms a dense, bush-like growth that can be found attached to various substrates such as rocks or shells. Its translucent appearance and intricate morphology make it a subject of interest in marine biology.</p>
<p>Bugula obliqua plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to reef-like structures.</p>
