                    <h1>Brassica botrytis</h1>
<p>Brassica botrytis, commonly known as the cabbage aphid, is a species of aphid that primarily infests cruciferous plants such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.</p>
<p>It feeds on the sap of these plants, causing stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced yield. The aphid reproduces rapidly, often leading to dense colonies on the undersides of leaves. It overwinters as eggs on host plants, hatching in spring to infest new growth.</p>
<p>Its presence can significantly impact the health and productivity of Brassica crops.</p>
