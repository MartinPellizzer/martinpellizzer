<p>Bladhia brevipedata, commonly known as the short-footed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Bladhia brevipedata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting microscopic prey.</p>
