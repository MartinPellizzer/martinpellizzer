<p>Breynia vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Breynia vestita is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
