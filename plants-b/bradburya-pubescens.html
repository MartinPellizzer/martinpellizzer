                    <h1>Bradburya pubescens</h1>
<p>Bradburya pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones being more compact, both of which are typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Bradburya pubescens is also noted for its slow growth and preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
