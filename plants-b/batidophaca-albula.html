                    <h1>Batidophaca albula</h1>
<p>Batidophaca albula, commonly known as the white-flowered batidophaca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
