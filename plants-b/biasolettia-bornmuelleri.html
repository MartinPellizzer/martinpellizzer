<p>Biasolettia bornmuelleri, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often found in natural habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
