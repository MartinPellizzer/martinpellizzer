                    <h1>Betula glandulosa var. sibirica</h1>
<p>Betula glandulosa var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, which becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental bark and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in colder regions for landscaping purposes.</p>
