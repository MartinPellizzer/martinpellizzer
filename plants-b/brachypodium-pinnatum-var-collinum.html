                    <h1>Brachypodium pinnatum var. collinum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pinnatum var. collinum, commonly known as the mountain bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky or poor soil conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
