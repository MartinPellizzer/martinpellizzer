                    <h1>Betula rezniczenkoana var. obiquesquamata</h1>
<p>Betula rezniczenkoana var. obiquesquamata, commonly known as the narrow-scaled birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and closely arranged leaf scales, which give it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and has a slender, often multi-stemmed growth form. Its bark is typically smooth and pale, with a texture that becomes fissured as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
