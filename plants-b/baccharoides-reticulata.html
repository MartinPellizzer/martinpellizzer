                    <h1>Baccharoides reticulata</h1>
<p>Baccharoides reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Baccharoides reticulata is often found in scrublands and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
