                    <h1>Badilloa salicina</h1>
<p>Badilloa salicina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Badilloa salicina is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
