                    <h1>Bahia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Bahia glandulosa, commonly known as sticky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and the presence of glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
