                    <h1>Bouteloua dactyloides</h1>
<p>Bouteloua dactyloides, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has fine, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
