<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a smooth, light-colored inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula seravschanica is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures.</p>
