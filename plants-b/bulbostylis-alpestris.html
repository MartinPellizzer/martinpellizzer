<p>Bulbostylis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bulbostylis, is a small grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
