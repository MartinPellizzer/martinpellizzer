<p>Bulbophyllum tectipes, commonly known as the shielded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and often shaded environment.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum tectipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
