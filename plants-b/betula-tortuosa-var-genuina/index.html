                            <h1>Betula Tortuosa Var. Genuina</h1>
<p>Twisted birch, scientifically known as Betula tortuosa var. genuina, is a rare and striking tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. Its unique appearance is characterized by its contorted trunk and branches that twist and coil in unusual patterns. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Despite its delicate beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas. The twisted birch is not only a botanical curiosity but also an important indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
