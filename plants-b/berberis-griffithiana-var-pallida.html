                    <h1>Berberis griffithiana var. pallida</h1>
<p>Berberis griffithiana var. pallida, commonly known as the pale barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features slender, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact growth habit.</p>
