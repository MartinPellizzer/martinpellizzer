                    <h1>Bulbophyllum microcharis</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum microcharis, commonly known as the miniature charis orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose potting media.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
