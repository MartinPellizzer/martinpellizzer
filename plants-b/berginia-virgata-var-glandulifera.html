<p>Berginia virgata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered with glandular hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
