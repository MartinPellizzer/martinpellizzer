<p>Biscutella flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water.</p>
<p>Biscutella flexuosa is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
