<p>Bilabrella arianae, commonly known as the Arabian bilabrella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
