                    <h1>Byrsophyllum</h1>
<p>Byrsophyllum, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, cylindrical trunks that store water, enabling them to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and may be simple or lobed, while the flowers are showy and often attract pollinators like birds and insects. Byrsophyllum species are native to Australia and some parts of Southeast Asia, where they are well adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology makes them both ecologically significant and visually striking in their native habitats.</p>
