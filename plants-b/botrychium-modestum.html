                    <h1>Botrychium modestum</h1>
<p>Botrychium modestum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorangia, which are arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium modestum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
