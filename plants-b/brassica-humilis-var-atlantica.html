                    <h1>Brassica humilis var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Brassica humilis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mustard, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by short, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions.</p>
