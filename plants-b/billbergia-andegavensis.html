                    <h1>Billbergia andegavensis</h1>
<p>Billbergia andegavensis, commonly known as the Andean billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia andegavensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
