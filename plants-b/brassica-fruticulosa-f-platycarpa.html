                    <h1>Brassica fruticulosa f. platycarpa</h1>
<p>Brassica fruticulosa f. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited wild mustard, is a variant of the wild mustard plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring woody stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, pale green to yellow pods containing several seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a weed in agricultural settings and its potential use in phytochemical research.</p>
<p>The f. platycarpa form is distinguished by its broader, more robust fruits compared to the typical form.</p>
