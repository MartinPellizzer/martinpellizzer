                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum var. obliquum</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern-like fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
