                    <h1>Batrachium circinatum var. subrigidum</h1>
<p>Batrachium circinatum var. subrigidum, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are short and often clustered at the base, with the bladders arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more rigid leaf structure compared to other varieties of Batrachium.</p>
