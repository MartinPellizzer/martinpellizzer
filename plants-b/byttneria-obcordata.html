                    <h1>Byttneria obcordata</h1>
<p>Byttneria obcordata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
