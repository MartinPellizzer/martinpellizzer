                    <h1>Berberis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Berberis tomentosa, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense, sprawling colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a dense white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>Berberis tomentosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
