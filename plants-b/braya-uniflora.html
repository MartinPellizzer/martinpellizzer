<p>Braya uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower per stem, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Braya uniflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem.</p>
