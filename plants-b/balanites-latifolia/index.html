                            <h1>Balanites Latifolia</h1>
<p>Balanites tree, scientifically known as Balanites latifolia, is a resilient shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. The tree is recognized for its unique, thickened, and often fissured bark that provides protection against extreme temperatures. Its fruit, which contains a single large seed, is both edible and has traditional medicinal uses. This hardy species plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems and is valued for its cultural and practical significance.</p>
