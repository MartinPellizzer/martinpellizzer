<p>Borassus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild date palm, is a tall, robust palm native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height, covered with persistent leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its inflorescences are clustered and bear small, yellowish flowers, which eventually develop into edible dates.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its fibrous trunk, which is used in construction and handicrafts.</p>
