                <h1>Bryophyllum delagoense</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum delagoense, commonly known as the "Mother of Millions," is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring and summer months. One of its most notable features is its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings, which can develop into new plants rapidly.</p>
<p>This adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
