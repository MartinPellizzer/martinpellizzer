                    <h1>Baccharis umbelliformis f. frigida</h1>
<p>Baccharis umbelliformis f. frigida, commonly known as the frigid baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. These flowers are arranged in umbel-like inflorescences, giving the plant its species name.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
