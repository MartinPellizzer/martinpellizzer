                    <h1>Bulbophyllum scopa</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum scopa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and its striking, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks a visible stem and instead relies on its roots to anchor itself to trees or rocks. It is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its aerial roots.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
