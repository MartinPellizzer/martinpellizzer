<p>Brachyachne simonii, commonly known as the Simon's bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Brachyachne simonii thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with limited water availability.</p>
