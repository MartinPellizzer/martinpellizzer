                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. tunetanus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. tunetanus, commonly known as the Tunisian soft brome, is a perennial grass native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, hairless leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other bromus species but is distinguished by its unique morphological traits.</p>
