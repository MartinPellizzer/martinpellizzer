                    <h1>Betula stenolepis</h1>
<p>Betula stenolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
