                    <h1>Brahea pimo</h1>
<p>Brahea pimo, commonly known as the Pima bristlecone, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Brahea pimo thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and protected in many areas.</p>
