<p>Bouteloua chasei, commonly known as black grama, is a native grass species found primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a warm-season grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flower clusters that are typically brown or reddish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and hardiness, it is a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
