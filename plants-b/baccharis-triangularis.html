                    <h1>Baccharis triangularis</h1>
<p>Baccharis triangularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, triangular leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for its potential healing properties.</p>
