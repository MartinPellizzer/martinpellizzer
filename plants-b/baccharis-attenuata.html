                    <h1>Baccharis attenuata</h1>
<p>Baccharis attenuata, commonly known as sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Baccharis attenuata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
