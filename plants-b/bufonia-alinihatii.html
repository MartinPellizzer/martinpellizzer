<p>Bufonia alinihatii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the humid climate of its native habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Bufonia alinihatii is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
