                    <h1>Brassavola nodosa var. rhopalorrhachis</h1>
<p>Brassavola nodosa var. rhopalorrhachis, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and has fibrous roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
