                    <h1>Bidens andicola f. dissecta</h1>
<p>Bidens andicola f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
