<p>Brachiaria digitarioides, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming extensive mats that stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both an important forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
