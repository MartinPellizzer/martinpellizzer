                    <h1>Binghamia icosagona</h1>
<p>Binghamia icosagona, commonly known as the twenty-sided plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, geometrically shaped leaves that form a dense rosette, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically arranged in a symmetrical pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Binghamia icosagona is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and fascinating example of botanical adaptation.</p>
