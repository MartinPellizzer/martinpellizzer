                    <h1>Brassica amplexicaulis f. cedrorum</h1>
<p>Brassica amplexicaulis f. cedrorum, commonly known as the Alpine cabbage, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
