<p>Burckella fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Fiji.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences.
