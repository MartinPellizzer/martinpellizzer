                    <h1>Boerhavia repens</h1>
<p>Boerhavia repens, commonly known as spreading pigweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to warm climates.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Boerhavia repens is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
