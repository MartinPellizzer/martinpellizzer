                    <h1>Bromus arcticus var. vogulicus</h1>
<p>Bromus arcticus var. vogulicus, commonly known as the Vogulian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in low nutrient soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments.</p>
