<p>Bunchosia dwyeri, commonly known as the Dwyer's burro bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Bunchosia dwyeri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
