                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. hispidum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. hispidum, commonly known as hairy bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Brachypodium. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
