                    <h1>Bruguiera oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Bruguiera oxyphylla, commonly known as the mangrove tree or red mangrove, is a halophytic species that thrives in coastal saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stilt roots, which provide structural support in soft, waterlogged soils. The plant possesses pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor tidal waters. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera oxyphylla plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
