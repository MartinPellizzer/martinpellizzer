                    <h1>Bassia rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Bassia rubiginosa, commonly known as smooth stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, enabling it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Bassia rubiginosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
