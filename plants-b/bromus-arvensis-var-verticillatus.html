                    <h1>Bromus arvensis var. verticillatus</h1>
<p>Bromus arvensis var. verticillatus, commonly known as the common brome or yellow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are often arranged in a whorled pattern, giving it its specific epithet "verticillatus," meaning "in a whorl.". Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters.</p>
<p>This grass is often considered a weed in cultivated areas but plays a role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock.</p>
