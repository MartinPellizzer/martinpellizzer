                    <h1>Balanophora saxicola</h1>
<p>Balanophora saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a holoparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to penetrate the roots of its host plants, forming a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
