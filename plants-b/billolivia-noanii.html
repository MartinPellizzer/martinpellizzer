<p>Billolivia noanii, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that resemble a star. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many desert plants.</p>
<p>Billolivia noanii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
