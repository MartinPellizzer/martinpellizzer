                    <h1>Batrachium mongolicum subsp. setosissimum</h1>
<p>Batrachium mongolicum subsp.</p>
<p>setosissimum, commonly known as the Mongolian batrachium, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, setose (hairy) appearance, which aids in moisture retention and protection from herbivory.</p>
