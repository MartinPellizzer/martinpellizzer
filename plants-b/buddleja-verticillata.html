<p>Buddleja verticillata, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. It is a fast-growing species that can reach heights of up to 6 feet.</p>
<p>While it is popular in gardens for attracting pollinators, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal.</p>
