                    <h1>Bermudiana scabra</h1>
<p>Bermudiana scabra, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly invasive in many environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds, facilitating its spread through wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop, though it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
