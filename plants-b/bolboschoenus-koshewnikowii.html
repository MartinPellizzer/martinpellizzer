                    <h1>Bolboschoenus koshewnikowii</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus koshewnikowii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has a distinctive bulbous base, which helps it survive in waterlogged conditions. It thrives in marshes, pond margins, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
