                    <h1>Bromus ligusticus var. major</h1>
<p>Bromus ligusticus var. major, commonly known as the Italian quackgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a weed and a valuable forage plant.</p>
