                    <h1>Bletia gebina</h1>
<p>Bletia gebina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly forms, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Bletia gebina is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
