                    <h1>Bacopa elongata</h1>
<p>Bacopa elongata, commonly known as water bead plant or Indian water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces tiny, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields.</p>
<p>Bacopa elongata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported cognitive and calming effects.</p>
