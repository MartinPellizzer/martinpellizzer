                    <h1>Berula repanda</h1>
<p>Berula repanda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in loose clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Berula repanda is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
