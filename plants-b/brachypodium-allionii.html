<p>Brachypodium allionii, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a small perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland ecosystems.</p>
