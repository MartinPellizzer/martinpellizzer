<p>Bolbitis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or partially submerged, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Bolbitis intermedia is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic qualities and ability to improve water clarity.</p>
