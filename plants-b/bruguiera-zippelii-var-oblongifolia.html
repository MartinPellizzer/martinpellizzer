<p>Bruguiera zippelii var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a variant of the bruguiera species native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in brackish water. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an essential component of mangrove forests.</p>
