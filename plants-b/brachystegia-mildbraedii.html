                    <h1>Brachystegia mildbraedii</h1>
<p>Brachystegia mildbraedii, commonly known as the African brachystegia, is a medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets, which helps in reducing water loss in its often dry habitat. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and is often found in miombo woodlands, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
