                    <h1>Bromelia palmeri</h1>
<p>Bromelia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. The leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
