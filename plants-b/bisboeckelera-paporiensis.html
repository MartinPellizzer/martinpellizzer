The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with a fibrous root system, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
