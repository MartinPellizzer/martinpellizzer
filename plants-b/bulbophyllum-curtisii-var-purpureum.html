                    <h1>Bulbophyllum curtisii var. purpureum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum curtisii var. purpureum, commonly known as the Purple Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear strikingly colored, intricate flowers with a purple and white pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
