<p>Bourreria baccata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spongy roots that help it survive in saline water and tidal zones. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, flescent berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
