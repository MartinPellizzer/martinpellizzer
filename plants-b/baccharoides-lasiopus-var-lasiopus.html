                    <h1>Baccharoides lasiopus var. lasiopus</h1>
<p>Baccharoides lasiopus var. lasiopus, commonly known as the silky beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and saline environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats.</p>
