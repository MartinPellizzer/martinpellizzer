<p>Bulbostylis rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact stature and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
