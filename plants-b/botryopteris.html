                    <h1>Botryopteris</h1>
<p>Botryopteris, commonly known as the star fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique, star-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>These fronds are composed of multiple pinnae that radiate outward, creating a visually striking appearance. Botryopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's rhizome is often short and thick, supporting the upright growth of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botryopteris is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in humid habitats.</p>
