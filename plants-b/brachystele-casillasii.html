                    <h1>Brachystele casillasii</h1>
<p>Brachystele casillasii, commonly known as the Casillas' stilted fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, upright rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in high humidity and shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Brachystele casillasii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare fern.</p>
