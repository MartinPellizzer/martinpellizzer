<p>Bruguiera zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in gas exchange and provide structural support in tidal environments. The plant thrives in brackish water and is often found in coastal areas with high salinity. Its leaves are typically small and thick, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Bruguiera zippelii plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
