<p>Boopis graminea, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in clusters and are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses.</p>
<p>Boopis graminea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
