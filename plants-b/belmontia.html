<p>Belmontia, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically have five petals and a prominent central disk. Belmontia species are often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Their flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
