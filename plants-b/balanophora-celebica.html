                    <h1>Balanophora celebica</h1>
<p>Balanophora celebica, commonly known as the Celebes ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on trees in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
