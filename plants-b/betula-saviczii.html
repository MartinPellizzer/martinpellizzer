                    <h1>Betula saviczii</h1>
<p>Betula saviczii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping.</p>
<p>Betula saviczii is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in taiga and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
