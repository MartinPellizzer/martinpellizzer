                    <h1>Baeria macrantha var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Baeria macrantha var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal baeria, is a variant of the baeria plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to survive in saline soils and coastal winds. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in arid or windy conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas, contributing to the stabilization of dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
