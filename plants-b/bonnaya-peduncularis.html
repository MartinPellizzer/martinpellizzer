                    <h1>Bonnaya peduncularis</h1>
<p>Bonnaya peduncularis, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bonnaya peduncularis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
