<p>Bacopa stricta var. elongata, commonly known as the slender water bead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its slender, branching stems. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to purify water, it is a popular choice for aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
