                    <h1>Banksia oleifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia oleifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish or greyish hue, and are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Banksia oleifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
