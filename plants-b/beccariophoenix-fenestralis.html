<p>Beccariophoenix fenestralis, commonly known as the fenestrated palm, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to Madagascar, this palm is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a unique fenestrated pattern, giving it its common name. The plant features a slender, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and the fruit is a bright red drupe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
