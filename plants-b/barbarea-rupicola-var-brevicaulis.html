<p>Barbarea rupicola var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
