                    <h1>Biotia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Biotia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved biotia, is a rare and unique member of the Lecanorales order.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and leathery thallus that often forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central stipe and a broad, disc-like apothecium. Its reproductive structures are typically orange to reddish in color, and it produces ascospores that are released through the apothecium.</p>
<p>Biotia macrophylla is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often on acidic substrates in temperate regions.</p>
