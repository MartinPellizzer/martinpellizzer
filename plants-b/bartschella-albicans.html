                    <h1>Bartschella albicans</h1>
<p>Bartschella albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate structure makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
