                    <h1>Botrychium jenmanii</h1>
<p>Botrychium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's moonwort, is a rare fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Botrychium jenmanii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
