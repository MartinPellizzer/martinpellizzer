<p>Bourreria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its yellow composite flowers that develop into puffball-like seed heads. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
