                    <h1>Baeothryon pusillum</h1>
<p>Baeothryon pusillum, commonly known as the small baeothryon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Baeothryon pusillum is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
