                    <h1>Banksia pugioniformis</h1>
<p>Banksia pugioniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces long, narrow cones that contain hard, woody seeds, which are adapted for release in specific environmental conditions. Banksia pugioniformis is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the local flora.</p>
