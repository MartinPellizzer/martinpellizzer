                    <h1>Blaeria granvikii</h1>
<p>Blaeria granvikii, commonly known as the Granvik's bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized structures for capturing prey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its small, bladder-like traps that ensnare tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Blaeria granvikii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
