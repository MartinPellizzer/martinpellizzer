<p>Botrychium lunaria var. simplex, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, with the central leaf bearing a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a unique reproductive system where spores are released from the sorus and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Botrychium lunaria var. simplex is a perennial plant that exhibits a primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage.</p>
