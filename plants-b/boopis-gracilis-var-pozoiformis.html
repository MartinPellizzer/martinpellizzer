<p>Boopis gracilis var. pozoiformis, commonly known as the slender boopis, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
