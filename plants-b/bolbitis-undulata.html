                    <h1>Bolbitis undulata</h1>
<p>Bolbitis undulata, commonly known as the wavy fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that have a wavy, undulating edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in humid undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
