                    <h1>Begonia trapa</h1>
<p>Begonia trapa, commonly known as water begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Begonia trapa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
