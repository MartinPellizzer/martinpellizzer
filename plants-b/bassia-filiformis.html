<p>Bassia filiformis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering the ground in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thread-like and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bassia filiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
