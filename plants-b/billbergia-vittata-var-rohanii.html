                    <h1>Billbergia vittata var. rohanii</h1>
<p>Billbergia vittata var. rohanii, commonly known as the silver stripe billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-striped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
