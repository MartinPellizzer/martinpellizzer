                    <h1>Banara brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Banara brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
