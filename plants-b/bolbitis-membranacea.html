<p>Bolbitis membranacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Bolbitis membranacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in the right conditions.</p>
