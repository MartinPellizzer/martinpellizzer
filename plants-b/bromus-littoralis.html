                    <h1>Bromus littoralis</h1>
<p>Bromus littoralis, commonly known as the seaside brome, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing bristle-like flowers, which are typically found in the early spring. Bromus littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
