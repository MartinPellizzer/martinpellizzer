<p>Berrya vescoana, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Berrya vescoana is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
