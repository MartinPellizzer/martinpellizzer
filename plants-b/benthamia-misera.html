<p>Benthamia misera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily in the wind. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Benthamia misera is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
