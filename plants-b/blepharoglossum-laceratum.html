<p>Blepharoglossum laceratum, commonly known as the lace-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a popular plant among fern enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
