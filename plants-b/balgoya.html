<p>Balgoya, commonly known as the "blueberry bush," is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are white and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Balgoya is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruits, which are rich in antioxidants.</p>
