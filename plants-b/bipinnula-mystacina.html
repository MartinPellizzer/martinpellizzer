<p>Bipinnula mystacina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive pinnate structure, contributing to its scientific name.</p>
