<p>Basselinia gracilis, commonly known as the slender moss-fern, is a delicate aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on the water surface or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps it float and retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Basselinia gracilis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
