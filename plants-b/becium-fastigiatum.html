<p>Becium fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved becium, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts.</p>
