                    <h1>Buxus nitidus</h1>
<p>Buxus nitidus, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is widely used in formal garden designs.</p>
