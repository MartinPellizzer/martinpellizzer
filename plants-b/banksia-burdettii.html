                    <h1>Banksia burdettii</h1>
<p>Banksia burdettii, commonly known as the Burdett's banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bear long, narrow, yellowish flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody cones that remain on the plant for many years, eventually releasing seeds when the cones dry and open. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating, and it is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia burdettii is an important component of the local flora and plays a significant role in supporting native wildlife.</p>
