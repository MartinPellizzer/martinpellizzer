                    <h1>Bolbitis annamensis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis annamensis, commonly known as the Annam fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and serrated leaf blade. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis annamensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
