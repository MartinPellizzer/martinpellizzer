<p>Baldellia repens subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
