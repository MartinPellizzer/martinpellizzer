                    <h1>Biarum bovei var. discolor</h1>
<p>Biarum bovei var. discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular, white to greenish-white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is notable for its deceptive appearance, as the flowers resemble female insects to attract male pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
