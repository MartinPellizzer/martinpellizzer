                    <h1>Brossaea glaucifolia</h1>
<p>Brossaea glaucifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf brossaea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
