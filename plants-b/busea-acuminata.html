                    <h1>Busea acuminata</h1>
<p>Busea acuminata, commonly known as the Indian bdellium or frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the dry regions of India, Arabia, and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, resinous capsules that contain aromatic gum resins. These resins have been historically valued for their use in incense, medicine, and perfume.</p>
<p>Busea acuminata is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
