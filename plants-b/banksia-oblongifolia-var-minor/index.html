                            <h1>Banksia Oblongifolia Var. Minor</h1>
<p>Banksia minor, scientifically known as Banksia oblongifolia var. minor, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter or early spring. This variety is particularly adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its resilience to drought and salt spray makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects. Despite its modest size, Banksia minor plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
