                    <h1>Bromus tectorum</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum, commonly known as cheatgrass, is an annual grass native to Eurasia but now widely invasive in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is highly competitive, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and seed production contribute to its invasive success in various ecosystems.</p>
